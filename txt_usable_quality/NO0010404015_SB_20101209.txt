Seaproducts AS Callable Senior Secured Bond Issue" with ISIN NO 001 040401.5 and the bond

BACKGROUND

............

The Issuer has informed the Loan Trustee of the following:

Due to delayed delivery of, and cost overruns related to, the construction of the krill harvesting and factoring vessel M/S Thorshovdi (the "Vessel"), followed by a disappointing first year of operations, the Issuer is currently in severe financial difficulties. The Vessel is currently located at a shipyard in Punta Arenas, Chile, for annual survey and maintenance work ahead of the upcoming fishing season.

Neither the Issuer's budget for 2011 nor its estimates for 2012 support the present capital structure of the Issuer, and it is evident that the Issuer would need to undergo a substantial deleveraging. In addition, the Issuer has an immediate need for a cash injection in the region of NOK 80-100 million ahead of the fishing season.

For more detailed information, please contact the Chairman, James Stove Lorentzen (+47 915 11 092), or the Chief Financial Officer, Ole Magnus Bjerke (tel: +47 958 73 330), of the Issuer.

Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting. It will also serve as proof of your right to subscribe for new shares in the Company in accordance with the Restructuring Plan. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the, aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.) The individual bondholder may authorise the Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Norsk Tillitsmann to vote, must then be returned to Norsk Tillitsmann in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details). In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Loan Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds. For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to Norsk Tillitsmann, to notify Norsk Tillitsmann by telephone or by email (at set out at the first page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
