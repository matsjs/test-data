BACKGROUND

Following the significant drop in oil price since the second half of 2014, the oil & offshore market is in general facing severe challenges. The majority of the Company's fleet remains on long-term contracts with national and independent oil companies, and the fleet should continue to generate a significant cash flow during the time ahead. The Company has also taken measures to adapt to the prevailing market conditions. However, due to risk of customers defaulting on payment obligations, down-payments of debt, challenging capital markets, certain unforeseen events, capital commitments on Catcher and life extension programs, the Company may be close to or below the minimum liquidity covenant of USD 75 million in the first quarter of 2017.

As announced in relation to the fourth quarter 2015 reporting, the Company has been evaluating necessary actions to address the challenges and to secure a credible long term financial platform. Over the last months' discussions with its bank facility providers, selected Bondholders in the Bond Issues

2/14

and largest shareholders have been ongoing. The key outcome of the discussion is listed in section 2 below (the "Financing Plan") and includes amongst others amortization relieves and extensions of the balloon repayment under the Corporate Facility (as referred to in section 2.1 below), reduced financial covenants, extension of the Maturity Dates for the Bond Issues and a rights issue in the total amount of USD 100 million (the "Equity Issue"). In total, the Financing Plan will contribute in excess of USD 0.5 billion in improved liquidity in the period throughout 2020, and thereby give the Company a significant runway until the markets are expected to recover.
The Financing Plan has received indicative support from a representative group of Bondholders and support from key bank lenders. The Company's main shareholder, BW Group Limited, and the CEO of the Company, Carl Krogh Arnet, have pre-committed to subscribe for their pro rata share of the Equity Issue and the remaining shares to be issued in the Equity Issue are underwritten by a syndicate of banks, as set out in the Company's press release of 23 May 2016.
In addition to this summons letter, reference is made to the BW Offshore Q1 2016 report (the "Q1 Report") and the BW Offshore Q1 2016 presentation (the ""Ql Presentation"") both released on 23 May 2016 and which are intended to give background information and an update on the Company's financial and operating status. The Ql Presentation is available on the Issuer's web page www.bwoffshore.com, www.newsweb.no and www.stamdata.no. The Company will also host a conference call for the Bondholders as further described in section 4 below.

Addressing the liquidity situation

BW Offshore

 The significant drop in oil price has led to severe challenges both for the oil & offshore industry as well as the capital markets

Key circumstances particularly affecting BWO

- Challenging capital markets with limited availability to refinance existing bond debt

Cash development with current financing(1)

- Cidade de Sao Mateus extended offhire

USDm

- Contract for BW Athena terminated

600

- Increased overdues

400

 The company has evaluated actions to secure the financial platform until March 2020: - Equity injection - Amortization reliefs - Maturity extensions for both bank facilities and bonds

Overriding principle of equal treatment of creditors within same group and contribution from all stakeholders

23 May 2016.

1) Without proposed changes, assuming bonds not to be refinanced. The USD 2.4bn facility balloon of USD 641m in March 2018 is assumed refinanced at current amortization schedule of USD 111m semi annually.
