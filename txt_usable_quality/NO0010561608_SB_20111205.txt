To the bondholders in: ISIN NO 001056160.8 - 9.00 per cent Marine Subsea Cyprus Holding Ltd Bond Issue 2009/2019 (the "Bondholders")
Oslo, 5 December 2011
SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - AMENDMENT TO THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSED RESTRUCTURNG OF THE BONDS
Marine Subsea Cyprus Holding Ltd. is the issuer and borrower ("MSCH" or the "Borrower") under that certain Loan Agreement, dated 14 December 2009, (the "Bond Loan Agreement") between MSCH, Marine Subsea AS as parent guarantor (the "Parent") and Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") as Trustee, pursuant to which MSCH issued the above-referenced bonds with ISIN NO 001056160.8, in the original principal amount of USD 246,000,000 (the "Bonds").
Reference is made to the summons to Bondholders' meeting for the Bonds dated 21 November 2011 (the "Second Summons"). The Second Summons sets forth the terms of a Revised Restructuring proposal, the terms of which have been approved by the requisite percentage of Bondholders. All capitalised terms used herein that are not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Bond Loan Agreement or the Second Summons unless otherwise stated.
The purpose of this summons (the "Third Summons") is to seek Bondholder approval to an amendment to how the Bonds which remain outstanding after completion of the Revised Restructuring are to be treated and to amend certain other administrative and technical matters referred to in the Second Summons.
1. CANCELLATION OF THE BONDS
Under the terms of the Second Summons, the Revised Restructuring was to be conditional upon the holders of at least 50.1% of the Bonds entering into a bond purchase agreement with AOCH (the "Bond Purchase Agreement"). It is now proposed that upon Completion of the Revised Restructuring, the Bonds shall be cancelled and no further payments shall be made by MSCH in respect of the Bonds. This means that Bondholders will no longer be asked to enter into a Bond Purchase Agreement.
2. REVISED ALLOCATION DATES
The Second Summons sets out certain Allocation Dates, within 5 Oslo business days of which, NTM Refectio would effect the transfer of the Pro Rata Share to Approved Bondholders in batches to those Bondholders who are Approved Bondholders at the relevant time. Since it is now expected that the Revised Restructuring will complete later than was

anticipated at the time the Second Summons was issued, it is proposed that the Allocation Dates set forth in the Second Summons are amended and shall instead be as set forth below:
(i) 13 December 2011, if Completion has occurred prior to that date;
(ii) 9 January 2012;
(iii) 24 February 2012; and
(iv) the date falling three months from the Record Date.
3. REVISED LIST OF SHARES AND INTERCOMPANY DEBT
Under the terms of the Revised Restructuring, the list of shares and intercompany debt set out in the Schedule to the Second Summons which is to be acquired by AOCH shall be amended and replaced with the list contained within the Schedule to this Third Summons. For ease of reference, the only amendment concerns a correction to the shareholding which MSCH has in TEN Marine Drilling Ltd.
4. OTHER TERMS
The other terms set out in the Second Summons (and the summons dated 23 August 2011 that preceded the Second Summons) including, but not limited to, the conditional amendment of the Bond Loan Agreement, the conditional release of security and guarantees by both the Loan Trustee and Jaya and the purchase of the Barges, shall remain in full force and effect, save as where amended by this Third Summons.
5. TIMING
It is now anticipated that Completion of the Revised Restructuring will occur on or before 20 December 2011.
It is therefore proposed that the period for which the approvals contained in the First Summons, the Second Summons and this Third Summons are effective should be extended such that these approvals are effective on the basis that Completion occurs on or before 20 December 2011. However, the Loan Trustee shall have discretion to extend the deadline for Completion for a further 30 days.
6. SUMMONS FOR BONDHOLDERS' MEETING
Bondholders are hereby summoned to a Bondholders' meeting:
Time: 13 December 2011 at 13:00 (CET) Place: the premises of Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, Haakon VII's Gate 1, Oslo
