Cembrit has initiated an operational review to improve production performance
6 December 2017
Cembrit Group A/S ("Cembrit" or the "Company") has initiated an operational review process in order to resolve ongoing production issues in the Hungarian factory and to improve the overall financial performance of the Company. Market demand remains strong and Cembrit's factories in Finland, the Czech Republic, and Poland are performing satisfactorily.
The operational review aims to address Cembrit's weaker than expected financial performance since its EUR 115 million bond issue in March 2017. The owners, Board of Directors and management have already identified key strategic actions to be taken. These initiatives will reduce production complexity in the Hungarian facility in order to increase production output and will optimise and reduce inventory levels.
In conjunction with the operational review, the owners are evaluating a potential capital injection in order to maintain healthy liquidity levels while implementing the initiatives. Following completion of the review, management intends to set-up meetings with bond investors for which a separate invitation will be sent out.
Board of Directors, Cembrit
