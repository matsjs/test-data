of the Second Mortgagee hereunder; and

f)

if the Second Mortgagee intends to exercise any of its rights or powers of enforcement

exercisable at any time after delivery of such notice, of purchasing all of the

amounts outstanding under or in connection with the First Loan Agreement

(the "First Loan Debt") pursuant to an assignment and assumption of the

rights and obligations of the First Mortgagee, such assignment and

assumption to be at the expense of the Second Mortgagee or its nominee(s)

and at a purchase price equal to the amount of the First Loan Debt (but

excluding any prepayment premium or prepayment fee, however

characterised); provided however, that until receipt of the purchase price of the

First Loan Debt, the First Mortgagee shall continue to be entitled to enforce

any of its rights and powers with respect to the First Mortgagee Security;

(ii) consult in good faith with the Second Mortgagee for a reasonable period (in the circumstances) prior to any such exercise as to the timing and manner of such exercise (including, without limitation, as to the identity of any independent valuer appointed under (iii) below);

e)

it will not assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or obligations

without such party first entering into an agreement with the Second Mortgagee in form

and substance reasonably satisfactory to it whereby such party agrees to comply with

the obligations of the First Mortgagee hereunder;

f)

the First Mortgagee shall not secure any indebtedness other than the indebtedness of

the Mortgagors under the First Loan Agreement as the same may be amended, and/or

supplemented from time to time, such that the loan granted under the First Loan

Agreement remains within the maximum amount set out in recital (A) and the limits set

forth in Clause 4.1(b); and

3
UKDOCS/158801.2

g)

save as provided in Clause 3.1(f), the Second Mortgagee may at any time and from

time to time in its absolute discretion enforce or make any claims or exercise any of its

rights and powers with respect to the Second Mortgagee Security without prior

consultation with the First Mortgagee, except that it will not take any action to enforce

the Second Mortgagee Security with respect to Relevant Assets other than Delivered

Vessels unless permitted under Clause 3.1(c).

5
