Proposal to amend Bond Loan Agreements - Change of Borrower - Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("N TM " / "N orsk Tillitsmann") acts as trustee for the holders o f bonds (the "Bonds") in the above-captioned loans (the "Loans") where Norse Energy Holding Inc. ("NEHI") is the Borrower. All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreements dated 30 June 2010 (the "Loan Agreements") or the summons to this Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise stated. The information in this summons regarding the Company and its legal position is provided by the Company. Norsk Tillitsmann expressly disclaims all and any liability whatsoever related to such information,
1. BACKGROUND NEHI/NEC have approached NTM to summon a Bondholders' Meeting with respect to the Loans in order to propose to the Bondholders a change in the Loan Agreements where by Norse Energy Corp ASA ("NEC" or the "Company") is reinstated as the Borrower. . NEHI is a 100% owned subsidiary o f NEC. The purpose o f the proposal is to ensure that bondholders are not subject to U.S. withholding tax on interest payments. See attached letter from NEHI for background. Accordingly NEC/NEHI proposes that the Loan Agreements are changed where by NEC is reinstated as Borrower while NEHI remain co-responsible for payment as a Guarantor. With this solution the Bondholders w ill retain 100% o f the agreed interest without being exposed to U.S withholding tax.

NEHI/NEC proposes that the covenants in the Loan Agreements clause 16.2 is extended to also cover the Guarantor while the equity requirements in the Loan Agreements clauses 16.4 remain on NEHI level. Accordingly the covenant structure will remain upon the switch of roles among NEHI and NEC. Upon implementation thereof an intercompany loan with NEHI as debtor and NEC as creditor for the total amount will be reinstated and such loan included in the security for the bond loans.
2. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES
2.1. The Company's evaluation The Company is of the opinion that the proposal is strongly beneficial to the Company and all stakeholders including the Bondholders, who will retain full interest payment without deduction of withholding tax at source with no change in the debtor/guarantor obligations and/or value of the Bonds. . 2.2. NTM 's evaluation As a matter of policy, NTM puts the requests forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendation, and amplifies that each Bondholder cast its vote on the Bondholders' meeting based on its own judgment. NTM urges each Bondholder to seek counsel in order to evaluate the Proposal.
3. SUMMONS FOR BONDHOLDERS' MEETINGS
A joint bondholders' meeting will be held for all bond issues. Voting procedures will be carried out separately for each individual bond issue. Based on the above information, Bondholders are hereby summoned to a bondholders' meeting: Time: 25 May 2011 at 13.00 (Oslo time) Place: The premises of Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, Haakon VU's gate 1, Oslo (Norway)
Agenda:

(ii) the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries may enter into and carry out mergers and similar transactions if, after giving effect to each such transaction (a) the asset to debt ratio of the affected entities is improved and (b) the Loan Trustee concludes that the merger is not likely to have a material negative impact on the Guarantor's ability to meet its obligations under the NEHI Loans,
(c) enter into related party transactions and other transactions not on arm'slength terms, except for intercompany service/management arrangements
(i) among the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) among the Borrower and the Guarantor and/or the Guarantor's Subsidiaries for provision of group services for a total amount not to exceed USD 1 million in any year,
(iii) among the Borrower and those of its Subsidiaries that are not part of the U.S. Group, and
(iv) otherwise, on arm's length terms and satisfactory to the Loan Trustee,
(d) without limiting the prohibition on related party transactions set out in Clause 16.3(c), enter into any transaction between the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries and any other Subsidiaries of the Borrower with respect to any disposal or acquisition of assets, the making or receiving of any loan or the sharing of cash management or other treasury functions (but
6

the foregoing shall not prohibit sharing use of employees and operational systems or similar),
(e) make or declare any Distributions from the Guarantor or the Borrower
(f) permit the Guarantor to cease to be 100% owned (directly or indirectly) by the Borrower;

7

Clauses 16.3(g)(i), (g)(ii), (g)(iii) and (k)(ii));

Oslo, May 12, 2011
Reference is made to Norsk Tillitsm ann ASA's ("NTM") summons for a Bondholder Meeting on 25 May 2011 in the above bond loans (the "Loans") where Norse Energy Holdings Inc ("NEHI") is the borrower and Norse Energy Corp ASA ("NEC") is guarantor.
NEHI and NEC have approached NTM to sum m on a Bondholders' Meeting with respect to the Loans in order to propose to the Bondholders a change in the Loan Agreem ents where by NEC is reinstated as the Borrower while NEHI becomes Guarantor. NEHI is a 100% owned subsidiary of NEC.
In the initial bond loan agreements from 2006 and 2008, NEC was the Borrower. In the bond debt restructuring in 2010, NEHI assumed the role of the Borrower while NEC assumed the role of Guarantor.
Since then the Com pany has become aware that NEHI as an U.S. incorporated entity is required to deduct 30% withholding tax at source in interest payments to non-U.S bondholders. An exem ption is available for bondholders domiciled in states having a tax treaty with the U.S. (including Norway and Sweden) who provides NEHI with the completed W8-BEN form with information on their relevant bond holdings ("Eligible Bondholders", cf. below).
The Loan Agreements is supplemented by Norwegian law. Norwegian law entitles NEHI to deduct the U.S. withholding tax at source as prescribed by U.S. law.

NORSE ENERGY HOLDINGS INC · 200 NORTHPOINTE CIRCLE, STE 200 · SEVEN FIELDS, PA 16046 · TEL + 724-772-7070

No deductions at source have so far been made in respect of the interest paym ents from NEHI including the interest payment of April 2011.
NEHI has an obligation to pay withholding tax to the U.S. tax authorities irrespective of not having deducted at source. NEHI has so far carried the tax burden for the Bondholders by not deducting at source. This triggers a tax obligation upon NEHI and is clearly not a viable solution to NEC/NEHI in the long term.
Accordingly NEHI proposes that the Loan Agreem ents are changed where by NEC is reinstated as Borrower while NEHI remain co-responsible for payment as a Guarantor. With this solution the Bondholders will retain 100% of the agreed interest without being exposed to U.S withholding tax,
NEHI proposes that the covenants in the Loan Agreem ents clause 16.2 is extended to also cover the Guarantor while the equity requirem ents in the Loan Agreements clauses 16.4 remain on NEHI level. Accordingly the covenant structure will remain upon the switch of roles among NEHI and NEC. Upon implementation thereof an intercompany loan with NEHI as debtor and NEC as creditor for the total amount will be reinstated and such loan included in the security for the bond loans.
NEHI advices that if the Bondholder's Meeting should not approve the proposed am endm ents NEHI will start deducting a 30 % U.S. withholding tax at source in the future interest payment from and including the paym ents scheduled in June 2011. Only 70% of the agreed interest amounts would then be distributed to all Bondholders through the VPS/Nordea payment system . Eligible Bondholders would be entitled to receive the remaining 30% upon providing NEHI with W-8 BEN or W-9 forms with information on their holding as of each interest payment date.
However in order to save NEHI and the Eligible Bondholders for such adm inistrative burdens and to cater for payment of 100% of interest also to non-Eligible Bondholders, NEHI proposes that the Loan Agreements are amended as proposed herein.
As for the interest payments already made by NEHI, Eligible Bondholder (including but not limited to bondholders domiciled in Norway, Sweden and the U.S) should as soon as possible forward the relevant W8-BEN or W-9 form to NEHI with a specification of the total amount of interest received by the bondholder. Compliance therewith will reduce the U.S. tax obligation on NEHI, and its cash reserves be better spent on improving value to all its stakeholders including the holders of warrants, shares and bonds.

Instructions for Form W-8BEN

Internal Revenue Service

(Rev. February 2006)

Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding

General Instructions
Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.
For definitions of terms used throughout these instructions, see Definitions on pages 3 and 4.
Purpose of form. Foreign persons are subject to U.S. tax at a 30% rate on income they receive from U.S. sources that consists of:
· Interest (including certain original issue discount (OID)); · Dividends; · Rents; · Royalties; · Premiums; · Annuities; · Compensation for, or in expectation of, services performed; · Substitute payments in a securities lending transaction; or · Other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, or income.
This tax is imposed on the gross amount paid and is generally collected by withholding under section 1441 or 1442 on that amount. A payment is considered to have been made whether it is made directly to the beneficial owner or to another person, such as an intermediary, agent, or partnership, for the benefit of the beneficial owner.
In addition, section 1446 requires a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States to withhold tax on a foreign partner's distributive share of the partnership's effectively connected taxable income. Generally, a foreign person that is a partner in a partnership that submits a Form W-8 for purposes of section 1441 or 1442 will satisfy the documentation requirements under section 1446 as well. However, in some cases the documentation requirements of sections 1441 and 1442 do not match the documentation requirements of section 1446. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6. Further, the owner of a disregarded entity, rather than the disregarded entity itself, shall submit the appropriate Form W-8 for purposes of section 1446.
If you receive certain types of income, you must provide Form W-8BEN to: · Establish that you are not a U.S. person; · Claim that you are the beneficial owner of the income for which Form W-8BEN is being provided or a partner in a partnership subject to section 1446; and

· If applicable, claim a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding as a resident of a foreign country with which the United States has an income tax treaty.
You may also be required to submit Form W-8BEN to claim an exception from domestic information reporting and backup withholding for certain types of income that are not subject to foreign-person withholding. Such income includes: · Broker proceeds. · Short-term (183 days or less) original issue discount (OID). · Bank deposit interest. · Foreign source interest, dividends, rents, or royalties. · Proceeds from a wager placed by a nonresident alien individual in the games of blackjack, baccarat, craps, roulette, or big-6 wheel.
You may also use Form W-8BEN to certify that income from a notional principal contract is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
A withholding agent or payer of the income may rely on a properly completed Form W-8BEN to treat a payment associated with the Form W-8BEN as a payment to a foreign person who beneficially owns the amounts paid. If applicable, the withholding agent may rely on the Form W-8BEN to apply a reduced rate of withholding at source.
Provide Form W-8BEN to the withholding agent or payer before income is paid or credited to you. Failure to provide a Form W-8BEN when requested may lead to withholding at a 30% rate (foreign-person withholding) or the backup withholding rate.
Additional information. For additional information and instructions for the withholding agent, see the Instructions for the Requester of Forms W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY.
Who must file. You must give Form W-8BEN to the withholding agent or payer if you are a foreign person and you are the beneficial owner of an amount subject to withholding. Submit Form W-8BEN when requested by the withholding agent or payer whether or not you are claiming a reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding.
Do not use Form W-8BEN if: · You are a U.S. citizen (even if you reside outside the United States) or other U.S. person (including a resident alien individual). Instead, use Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification. · You are a disregarded entity with a single owner that is a U.S. person and you are not a hybrid entity claiming treaty benefits. Instead, provide Form W-9.

Cat. No. 25576H

· You are a nonresident alien individual who claims exemption from withholding on compensation for independent or dependent personal services performed in the United States. Instead, provide Form 8233, Exemption from Withholding on Compensation for Independent (and Certain Dependent) Personal Services of a Nonresident Alien Individual, or Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate.
· You are receiving income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, unless it is allocable to you through a partnership. Instead, provide Form W-8ECI, Certificate of Foreign Person's Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States. If any of the income for which you have provided a Form W-8BEN becomes effectively connected, this is a change in circumstances and Form W-8BEN is no longer valid. You must file Form W-8ECI. See Change in circum stances on this page.
· You are filing for a foreign government, international organization, foreign central bank of issue, foreign tax-exempt organization, foreign private foundation, or government of a U.S. possession claiming the applicability of section 115(2), 501(c), 892, 895, or 1443(b). Instead, provide Form W-8EXP, Certificate of Foreign Government or Other Foreign Organization for United States Tax Withholding. However, you should use Form W-8BEN if you are claiming treaty benefits or are providing the form only to claim you are a foreign person exempt from backup withholding. You should use Form W-8ECI if you received effectively connected income (for example, income from commercial activities).
· You are a foreign flow-through entity, other than a hybrid entity, claiming treaty benefits. Instead, provide Form W-8IMY, Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Flow-Through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding. However, if you are a partner, beneficiary, or owner of a flow-through entity and you are not yourself a flow-through entity, you may be required to furnish a Form W-8BEN to the flow-through entity.
· You are a disregarded entity for purposes of section 1446. Instead, the owner of the entity must submit the form.
· You are a reverse hybrid entity transmitting beneficial owner documentation provided by your interest holders to claim treaty benefits on their behalf. Instead, provide Form W-8IMY.
· You are a withholding foreign partnership or a withholding foreign trust within the meaning of sections 1441 and 1442 and the accompanying regulations. A withholding foreign partnership or a withholding foreign trust is a foreign partnership or trust that has entered into a withholding agreement with the IRS under which it agrees to assume primary withholding responsibility for each partner's, beneficiary's, or owner's distributive share of income subject to withholding that is paid to the partnership or trust. Instead, provide Form W-8IMY.
· You are acting as an intermediary (that is, acting not for your own account, but for the account of others as an agent, nominee, or custodian). Instead, provide Form W-8IMY.
· You are a foreign partnership or foreign grantor trust for purposes of section 1446. Instead, provide Form

W-8IMY and accompanying documentation. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6.
Giving Form W-8BEN to the withholding agent. Do not send Form W-8BEN to the IRS. Instead, give it to the person who is requesting it from you. Generally, this will be the person from whom you receive the payment, who credits your account, or a partnership that allocates income to you. Give Form W-8BEN to the person requesting it before the payment is made to you, credited to your account or allocated. If you do not provide this form, the withholding agent may have to withhold at the 30% rate, backup withholding rate, or the rate applicable under section 1446. If you receive more than one type of income from a single withholding agent for which you claim different benefits, the withholding agent may, at its option, require you to submit a Form W-8BEN for each different type of income. Generally, a separate Form W-8BEN must be given to each withholding agent.
Note. If you own the income or account jointly with one or more other persons, the income or account will be treated by the withholding agent as owned by a foreign person if Forms W-8BEN are provided by all of the owners. If the withholding agent receives a Form W-9 from any of the joint owners, the payment must be treated as made to a U.S. person.
Change in circumstances. If a change in circumstances makes any information on the Form W-8BEN you have submitted incorrect, you must notify the withholding agent or payer within 30 days of the change in circumstances and you must file a new Form W-8BEN or other appropriate form.
If you use Form W-8BEN to certify that you are a foreign person, a change of address to an address in the United States is a change in circumstances. Generally, a change of address within the same foreign country or to another foreign country is not a change in circumstances. However, if you use Form W-8BEN to claim treaty benefits, a move to the United States or outside the country where you have been claiming treaty benefits is a change in circumstances. In that case, you must notify the withholding agent or payer within 30 days of the move.
If you become a U.S. citizen or resident alien after you submit Form W-8BEN, you are no longer subject to the 30% withholding rate or the withholding tax on a foreign partner's share of effectively connected income. You must notify the withholding agent or payer within 30 days of becoming a U.S. citizen or resident alien. You may be required to provide a Form W-9. For more information, see Form W-9 and instructions.
Expiration of Form W-8BEN. Generally, a Form W-8BEN provided without a U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN) will remain in effect for a period starting on the date the form is signed and ending on the last day of the third succeeding calendar year, unless a change in circumstances makes any information on the form incorrect. For example, a Form W-8BEN signed on September 30, 2005, remains valid through December 31,2008. A Form W-8BEN furnished with a U.S. TIN will remain in effect until a change in circumstances makes any information on the form incorrect, provided that the withholding agent reports on Form 1042-S at least one payment annually to the beneficial owner who provided the Form W-8BEN. See the instructions for line 6

beginning on page 4 for circumstances under which you must provide a U.S. TIN.
Definitions
Beneficial owner. For payments other than those for which a reduced rate of withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, the beneficial owner of income is generally the person who is required under U.S. tax principles to include the income in gross income on a tax return. A person is not a beneficial owner of income, however, to the extent that person is receiving the income as a nominee, agent, or custodian, or to the extent the person is a conduit whose participation in a transaction is disregarded. In the case of amounts paid that do not constitute income, beneficial ownership is determined as if the payment were income.
Foreign partnerships, foreign simple trusts, and foreign grantor trusts are not the beneficial owners of income paid to the partnership or trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign partnership are generally the partners in the partnership, provided that the partner is not itself a partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee or other agent. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign simple trust (that is, a foreign trust that is described in section 651(a)) are generally the beneficiaries of the trust, if the beneficiary is not a foreign partnership, foreign simple or grantor trust, nominee or other agent. The beneficial owners of a foreign grantor trust (that is, a foreign trust to the extent that all or a portion of the income of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under sections 671 through 679) are the persons treated as the owners of the trust. The beneficial owners of income paid to a foreign complex trust (that is, a foreign trust that is not a foreign simple trust or foreign grantor trust) is the trust itself.
For purposes of section 1446, the same beneficial owner rules apply, except that under section 1446 a foreign simple trust rather than the beneficiary provides the form to the partnership.
The beneficial owner of income paid to a foreign estate is the estate itself.
Note. A payment to a U.S. partnership, U.S. trust, or U.S. estate is treated as a payment to a U.S. payee that is not subject to 30% withholding. A U.S. partnership, trust, or estate should provide the withholding agent with a Form W-9. For purposes of section 1446, a U.S. grantor trust or disregarded entity shall not provide the withholding agent a Form W-9 in its own right. Rather, the grantor or other owner shall provide the withholding agent the appropriate form.
Foreign person. A foreign person includes a nonresident alien individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign partnership, a foreign trust, a foreign estate, and any other person that is not a U.S. person. It also includes a foreign branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or U.S. clearing organization if the foreign branch is a qualified intermediary. Generally, a payment to a U.S. branch of a foreign person is a payment to a foreign person.
Nonresident alien individual. Any individual who is not a citizen or resident alien of the United States is a nonresident alien individual. An alien individual meeting either the "green card test" or the "substantial presence

test" for the calendar year is a resident alien. Any person not meeting either test is a nonresident alien individual. Additionally, an alien individual who is a resident of a foreign country under the residence article of an income tax treaty, or an alien individual who is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or American Samoa is a nonresident alien individual. See Pub. 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, for more information on resident and nonresident alien status.
SEven though a nonresident alien individual m arried to a U.S. citizen or resident alien may choose to be treated as a resident alien for certain purposes (for example, filing a joint incom e tax return), such individual is still treated as a nonresident alien for withholding tax purposes on all income except wages.
Flow-through entity. A flow-through entity is a foreign partnership (other than a withholding foreign partnership), a foreign simple or foreign grantor trust (other than a withholding foreign trust), or, for payments for which a reduced rate of withholding is claimed under an income tax treaty, any entity to the extent the entity is considered to be fiscally transparent (see below) with respect to the payment by an interest holder's jurisdiction.
For purposes of section 1446, a foreign partnership or foreign grantor trust must submit Form W-8IMY to establish the partnership or grantor trust as a look through entity. The Form W-8IMY may be accompanied by this form or another version of Form W-8 or Form W-9 to establish the foreign or domestic status of a partner or grantor or other owner. See Regulations section 1.1446-1.
Hybrid entity. A hybrid entity is any person (other than an individual) that is treated as fiscally transparent (see below) in the United States but is not treated as fiscally transparent by a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty. Hybrid entity status is relevant for claiming treaty benefits. See the instructions for line 9c on page 5.
Reverse hybrid entity. A reverse hybrid entity is any person (other than an individual) that is not fiscally transparent under U.S. tax law principles but that is fiscally transparent under the laws of a jurisdiction with which the United States has an income tax treaty. See the instructions for line 9c on page 5.
Fiscally transparent entity. An entity is treated as fiscally transparent with respect to an item of income for which treaty benefits are claimed to the extent that the interest holders in the entity must, on a current basis, take into account separately their shares of an item of income paid to the entity, whether or not distributed, and must determine the character of the items of income as if they were realized directly from the sources from which realized by the entity. For example, partnerships, common trust funds, and simple trusts or grantor trusts are generally considered to be fiscally transparent with respect to items of income received by them.
Disregarded entity. A business entity that has a single owner and is not a corporation under Regulations section 301.7701-2(b) is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner.

3-

A disregarded entity shall not submit this form to a partnership for purposes of section 1446. Instead, the owner of such entity shall provide appropriate documentation. See Regulations section 1.1446-1.
Amounts subject to withholding. Generally, an amount subject to withholding is an amount from sources within the United States that is fixed or determinable annual or periodical (FDAP) income. FDAP income is all income included in gross income, including interest (as well as OID), dividends, rents, royalties, and compensation. FDAP income does not include most gains from the sale of property (including market discount and option premiums).
For purposes of section 1446, the amount subject to withholding is the foreign partner's share of the partnership's effectively connected taxable income.
Withholding agent. Any person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, or custody of an amount subject to withholding or who can disburse or make payments of an amount subject to withholding is a withholding agent. The withholding agent may be an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other entity, including (but not limited to) any foreign intermediary, foreign partnership, and U.S. branches of certain foreign banks and insurance companies. Generally, the person who pays (or causes to be paid) the amount subject to withholding to the foreign person (or to its agent) must withhold.
For purposes of section 1446, the withholding agent is the partnership conducting the trade or business in the United States. For a publicly traded partnership, the withholding agent may be the partnership, a nominee holding an interest on behalf of a foreign person, or both. See Regulations sections 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-6.
Specific Instructions
A hybrid entity should give Form W -8BEN to a withholding agent only for income for which it is claim ing a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty. A reverse hybrid entity should give Form W -8BEN to a withholding agent only for income for which no treaty benefit is being claimed.
Part I
Line 1. Enter your name. If you are a disregarded entity with a single owner who is a foreign person and you are not claiming treaty benefits as a hybrid entity, this form should be completed and signed by your foreign single owner. If the account to which a payment is made or credited is in the name of the disregarded entity, the foreign single owner should inform the withholding agent of this fact. This may be done by including the name and account number of the disregarded entity on line 8 (reference number) of the form. However, if you are a disregarded entity that is claiming treaty benefits as a hybrid entity, this form should be completed and signed by you.
Line 2. If you are a corporation, enter the country of incorporation. If you are another type of entity, enter the country under whose laws you are created, organized, or

governed. If you are an individual, enter N/A (for "not applicable").
Line 3. Check the one box that applies. By checking a box, you are representing that you qualify for this classification. You must check the box that represents your classification (for example, corporation, partnership, trust, estate, etc.) under U.S. tax principles. Do not check the box that describes your status under the law of the treaty country. If you are a partnership or disregarded entity receiving a payment for which treaty benefits are being claimed, you must check the "Partnership" or "Disregarded entity" box. If you are a sole proprietor, check the "Individual" box, not the "Disregarded entity" box.
O nly entities that are tax-exempt under section 501 should check the "Tax-exempt organization" caution box. Such organizations should use Form W -8BEN only if they are claim ing a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty or some code exception other than section 501. Use Form W -8EXP if you are claim ing an exemption from withholding under section 501.
Line 4. Your permanent residence address is the address in the country where you claim to be a resident for purposes of that country's income tax. If you are giving Form W-8BEN to claim a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty, you must determine your residency in the manner required by the treaty. Do not show the address of a financial institution, a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes. If you are an individual who does not have a tax residence in any country, your permanent residence is where you normally reside. If you are not an individual and you do not have a tax residence in any country, the permanent residence address is where you maintain your principal office.
Line 5. Enter your mailing address only if it is different from the address you show on line 4.
Line 6. If you are an individual, you are generally required to enter your social security number (SSN). To apply for an SSN, get Form SS-5 from a Social Security Administration (SSA) office or, if in the United States, you may call the SSA at 1-800-772-1213. Fill in Form SS-5 and return it to the SSA.
If you do not have an SSN and are not eligible to get one, you must get an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). To apply for an ITIN, file Form W-7 with the IRS. It usually takes 4-6 weeks to get an ITIN.
Ak An ITIN is for tax use only. It does not entitle you to social security benefits or change your caution employment or immigration status under U.S. law.
If you are not an individual or you are an individual who is an employer or you are engaged in a U.S. trade or business as a sole proprietor, you must enter an employer identification number (EIN). If you do not have an EIN, you should apply for one on Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number. If you are a disregarded entity claiming treaty benefits as a hybrid entity, enter your EIN.
A partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States will likely be allocated effectively connected taxable income. The partner is

-4-

required to file a U.S. federal income tax return and must have a U.S. taxpayer identification number (TIN).
You must provide a U.S. TIN if you are: · Claiming an exemption from withholding under section 871(f) for certain annuities received under qualified plans, · A foreign grantor trust with 5 or fewer grantors, · Claiming benefits under an income tax treaty, or · Submitting the form to a partnership that conducts a trade or business in the United States.
However, a U.S. TIN is not required to be shown in order to claim treaty benefits on the following items of income: · Dividends and interest from stocks and debt obligations that are actively traded; · Dividends from any redeemable security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (mutual fund); · Dividends, interest, or royalties from units of beneficial interest in a unit investment trust that are (or were upon issuance) publicly offered and are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933; and · Income related to loans of any of the above securities.
You m ay want to obtain and provide a U.S. TIN on Form W -8BEN even though it is not required. A Form W -8BEN containing a U.S. TIN rem ains valid for as long as your status and the information relevant to the certifications you make on the form remain unchanged provided at least one payment is reported to you annually on Form 1042-S.
Line 7. If your country of residence for tax purposes has issued you a tax identifying number, enter it here. For example, if you are a resident of Canada, enter your Social Insurance Number.
Line 8. This line may be used by the filer of Form W-8BEN or by the withholding agent to whom it is provided to include any referencing information that is useful to the withholding agent in carrying out its obligations. For example, withholding agents who are required to associate the Form W-8BEN with a particular Form W-8IMY may want to use line 8 for a referencing number or code that will make the association clear. A beneficial owner may use line 8 to include the number of the account for which he or she is providing the form. A foreign single owner of a disregarded entity may use line 8 to inform the withholding agent that the account to which a payment is made or credited is in the name of the disregarded entity (see instructions for line 1 on page
4).
Part II
Line 9a. Enter the country where you claim to be a resident for income tax treaty purposes. For treaty purposes, a person is a resident of a treaty country if the person is a resident of that country under the terms of the treaty.
Line 9b. If you are claiming benefits under an income tax treaty, you must have a U.S. TIN unless one of the exceptions listed in the line 6 instructions above applies.
Line 9c. An entity (but not an individual) that is claiming a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty must represent that it: · Derives the item of income for which the treaty benefit is claimed, and

· Meets the limitation on benefits provisions contained in the treaty, if any.
An item of income may be derived by either the entity receiving the item of income or by the interest holders in the entity or, in certain circumstances, both. An item of income paid to an entity is considered to be derived by the entity only if the entity is not fiscally transparent under the laws of the entity's jurisdiction with respect to the item of income. An item of income paid to an entity shall be considered to be derived by the interest holder in the entity only if: · The interest holder is not fiscally transparent in its jurisdiction with respect to the item of income, and · The entity is considered to be fiscally transparent under the laws of the interest holder's jurisdiction with respect to the item of income. An item of income paid directly to a type of entity specifically identified in a treaty as a resident of a treaty jurisdiction is treated as derived by a resident of that treaty jurisdiction.
If an entity is claiming treaty benefits on its own behalf, it should complete Form W-8BEN. If an interest holder in an entity that is considered fiscally transparent in the interest holder's jurisdiction is claiming a treaty benefit, the interest holder should complete Form W-8BEN on its own behalf and the fiscally transparent entity should associate the interest holder's Form W-8BEN with a Form W-8IMY completed by the entity.
An income tax treaty may not apply to reduce the amount o f any tax on an item o f incom e received caution by an entity that is treated as a dom estic corporation for U.S. tax purposes. Therefore, neither the dom estic corporation nor its shareholders are entitled to the benefits o f a reduction o f U.S. income tax on an item o f income received from U.S. sources by the corporation.
To determine whether an entity meets the limitation on benefits provisions of a treaty, you must consult the specific provisions or articles under the treaties. Income tax treaties are available on the IRS website at www.irs.gov.
If you are an entity that derives the income as a resident of a treaty country, you m ay check this box if the applicable income tax treaty does not contain a "limitation on benefits" provision.
Line 9d. If you are a foreign corporation claiming treaty benefits under an income tax treaty that entered into force before January 1, 1987 (and has not been renegotiated) on (a) U.S. source dividends paid to you by another foreign corporation or (b) U.S. source interest paid to you by a U.S. trade or business of another foreign corporation, you must generally be a "qualified resident" of a treaty country. See section 884 for the definition of interest paid by a U.S. trade or business of a foreign corporation ("branch interest") and other applicable rules.
In general, a foreign corporation is a qualified resident of a country if any of the following apply. · It meets a 50% ownership and base erosion test. · It is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in its country of residence or the United States. · It carries on an active trade or business in its country of residence. · It gets a ruling from the IRS that it is a qualified resident.

5

See Regulations section 1.884-5 for the requirements that must be met to satisfy each of these tests.
If you are claim ing treaty benefits under an income tax treaty entered into force after caution Decem ber 31, 1986, do not check box 9d. Instead, check box 9c.
Line 9e. Check this box if you are related to the withholding agent within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b) and the aggregate amount subject to withholding received during the calendar year will exceed $500,000. Additionally, you must file Form 8833, Treaty-Based Return Position Disclosure Under Section 6114 or 7701(b).
Line 10
Line 10 must be used only if you are claiming treaty benefits that require that you meet conditions not covered by the representations you make in lines 9a through 9e. However, this line should always be completed by foreign students and researchers claiming treaty benefits. See Scholarship and fellowship grants below for more information.
The following are additional examples of persons who should complete this line. · Exempt organizations claiming treaty benefits under the exempt organization articles of the treaties with Canada, Mexico, Germany, and the Netherlands. · Foreign corporations that are claiming a preferential rate applicable to dividends based on ownership of a specific percentage of stock. · Persons claiming treaty benefits on royalties if the treaty contains different withholding rates for different types of royalties.
This line is generally not applicable to claiming treaty benefits under an interest or dividends (other than dividends subject to a preferential rate based on ownership) article of a treaty.
Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally, only a nonresident alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as a "saving clause." Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after the recipient has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes. The individual must use Form W-9 to claim the tax treaty benefit. See the instructions for Form W-9 for more information. Also see Nonresident alien student or researcher who becom es a resident alien later for an example.
Scholarship and fellowship grants. A nonresident alien student (including a trainee or business apprentice) or researcher who receives noncompensatory scholarship or fellowship income may use Form W-8BEN to claim benefits under a tax treaty that apply to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on such income. No Form W-8BEN is required unless a treaty benefit is being claimed. A nonresident alien student or researcher who receives compensatory scholarship or fellowship income must use Form 8233 to claim any benefits of a tax treaty that apply to that income. The student or researcher must use Form W-4 for any part of such income for which he or she is not claiming a tax treaty withholding exemption. Do not use Form W-8BEN for compensatory scholarship or

fellowship income. See Compensation for Dependent Personal Services in the Instructions for Form 8233.
If you are a nonresident alien individual who received noncompensatory scholarship or fellowship income and personal services income (including compensatory scholarship or fellowship income) from the same withholding agent, you m ay use Form 8233 to claim a tax treaty withholding exemption for part or all of both types o f income.
Com pleting lin e s 4 and 9a. Most tax treaties that contain an article exempting scholarship or fellowship grant income from taxation require that the recipient be a resident of the other treaty country at the time of, or immediately prior to, entry into the United States. Thus, a student or researcher may claim the exemption even if he or she no longer has a permanent address in the other treaty country after entry into the United States. If this is the case, you may provide a U.S. address on line 4 and still be eligible for the exemption if all other conditions required by the tax treaty are met. You must also identify on line 9a the tax treaty country of which you were a resident at the time of, or immediately prior to, your entry into the United States.
Com pleting lin e 10. You must complete line 10 if you are a student or researcher claiming an exemption from taxation on your scholarship or fellowship grant income under a tax treaty.
Nonresident alien student or researcher who becomes a resident alien. You must use Form W-9 to claim an exception to a saving clause. See Nonresident alien who becom es a resident alien on this page for a general explanation of saving clauses and exceptions to them.
Exam ple. Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship or fellowship income would complete Form W-9.
Part III
If you check this box, you must provide the withholding agent with the required statement for income from a notional principal contract that is to be treated as income not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. You should update this statement as often as necessary. A new Form W-8BEN is not required for each update provided the form otherwise remains valid.
Part IV
Form W-8BEN must be signed and dated by the beneficial owner of the income, or, if the beneficial owner is not an individual, by an authorized representative or

6-

officer of the beneficial owner. If Form W-8BEN is completed by an agent acting under a duly authorized power of attorney, the form must be accompanied by the power of attorney in proper form or a copy thereof specifically authorizing the agent to represent the principal in making, executing, and presenting the form. Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative, may be used for this purpose. The agent, as well as the beneficial owner, may incur liability for the penalties provided for an erroneous, false, or fraudulent form.
Broker transactions or barter exchanges. Income from transactions with a broker or a barter exchange is subject to reporting rules and backup withholding unless Form W-8BEN or a substitute form is filed to notify the broker or barter exchange that you are an exempt foreign person.
You are an exempt foreign person for a calendar year in which: · You are a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, partnership, estate, or trust; · You are an individual who has not been, and does not plan to be, present in the United States for a total of 183 days or more during the calendar year; and · You are neither engaged, nor plan to be engaged during the year, in a U.S. trade or business that has effectively connected gains from transactions with a broker or barter exchange.

Part II Certification
Under penalties of perjury, I certify that:
1. The number shown on this form is my correct taxpayer identification number (or I am waiting for a number to be issued to me), and
2. I am not subject to backup withholding because: (a) I am exempt from backup withholding, or (b) I have not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that I am subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified me that I am no longer subject to backup withholding, and

3. I am a U.S. citizen or other U.S. person (defined below).

Certification instructions. You must cross out item 2 above if you have been notified by the IRS that you are currently subject to backup withholding because you have failed to report all interest and dividends on your tax return. For real estate transactions, item 2 does not apply. For mortgage interest paid, acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, contributions to an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), and generally, payments other than interest and dividends, you are not required to sign the certification, but you must provide your correct TIN. See the instructions on page 4.

General Instructions
Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.
Purpose of Form
A person who is required to file an information return with the IRS must obtain your correct taxpayer identification number (TIN) to report, for example, income paid to you, real estate transactions, mortgage interest you paid, acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, or contributions you made to an IRA.
Use Form W-9 only if you are a U.S. person (including a resident alien), to provide your correct TIN to the person requesting it (the requester) and, when applicable, to:
1. Certify that the TIN you are giving is correct (or you are waiting for a number to be issued),
2. Certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, or
3. Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee. If applicable, you are also certifying that as a U.S. person, your allocable share of any partnership income from a U.S. trade or business is not subject to the withholding tax on foreign partners' share of effectively connected income.

Note. If a requester gives you a form other than Form W-9 to request your TIN, you must use the requester's form if it is substantially similar to this Form W-9.
Definition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S. person if you are:
· An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien,
· A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States,
· An estate (other than a foreign estate), or
· A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7).
Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax on any foreign partners' share of income from such business. Further, in certain cases where a Form W-9 has not been received, a partnership is required to presume that a partner is a foreign person, and pay the withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your U.S. status and avoid withholding on your share of partnership income.

Cat. No. 10231X

Form W -9 (Rev. 1-2011)

Form W-9 (Rev. 1-2011)
The person who gives Form W-9 to the partnership for purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its allocable share of net income from the partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States is in the following cases:
· The U.S. owner of a disregarded entity and not the entity,
· The U.S. grantor or other owner of a grantor trust and not the trust, and
· The U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust) and not the beneficiaries of the trust.
Foreign person. If you are a foreign person, do not use Form W-9. Instead, use the appropriate Form W-8 (see Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities).
Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally, only a nonresident alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as a "saving clause." Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after the payee has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.
If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in the saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the following five items:
1. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien.
2. The treaty article addressing the income.
3. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the saving clause and its exceptions.
4. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax.
5. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the treaty article.
Example. Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship or fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the information described above to support that exemption.
If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity not subject to backup withholding, give the requester the appropriate completed Form W-8.
What is backup withholding? Persons making certain payments to you must under certain conditions withhold and pay to the IRS a percentage of such payments. This is called "backup withholding." Payments that may be subject to backup withholding include interest, tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker and barter exchange transactions, rents, royalties, nonemployee pay, and certain payments from fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not subject to backup withholding.
You will not be subject to backup withholding on payments you receive if you give the requester your correct TIN, make the proper certifications, and report all your taxable interest and dividends on your tax return.
Payments you receive will be subject to backup withholding if:
1. You do not furnish your TIN to the requester,
2. You do not certify your TIN when required (see the Part II instructions on page 3 for details),
3. The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an incorrect TIN,
4. The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you did not report all your interest and dividends on your tax return (for reportable interest and dividends only), or
5. You do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to backup withholding under 4 above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts opened after 1983 only).

Page 2
Certain payees and payments are exempt from backup withholding. See the instructions below and the separate Instructions for the Requester of Form W-9.
Also see Special rules for partnerships on page 1.
Updating Your Information
You must provide updated information to any person to whom you claimed to be an exempt payee if you are no longer an exempt payee and anticipate receiving reportable payments in the future from this person. For example, you may need to provide updated information if you are a C corporation that elects to be an S corporation, or if you no longer are tax exempt. In addition, you must furnish a new Form W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the account, for example, if the grantor of a grantor trust dies.
Penalties
Failure to furnish TIN. If you fail to furnish your correct TIN to a requester, you are subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.
Civil penalty for false information with respect to withholding. If you make a false statement with no reasonable basis that results in no backup withholding, you are subject to a $500 penalty.
Criminal penalty for falsifying information. Willfully falsifying certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or imprisonment.
Misuse of TINs. If the requester discloses or uses TINs in violation of federal law, the requester may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.
Specific Instructions
Name
If you are an individual, you must generally enter the name shown on your income tax return. However, if you have changed your last name, for instance, due to marriage without informing the Social Security Administration of the name change, enter your first name, the last name shown on your social security card, and your new last name.
If the account is in joint names, list first, and then circle, the name of the person or entity whose number you entered in Part I of the form.
Sole proprietor. Enter your individual name as shown on your income tax return on the "Name" line. You may enter your business, trade, or "doing business as (DBA)" name on the " Business name/disregarded entity name" line.
Partnership, C Corporation, or S Corporation. Enter the entity's name on the "Name" line and any business, trade, or "doing business as (DBA) name" on the "Business name/disregarded entity name" line.
Disregarded entity. Enter the owner's name on the "Name" line. The name of the entity entered on the "Name" line should never be a disregarded entity. The name on the "Name" line must be the name shown on the income tax return on which the income will be reported. For example, if a foreign LLC that is treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal tax purposes has a domestic owner, the domestic owner's name is required to be provided on the "Name" line. If the direct owner of the entity is also a disregarded entity, enter the first owner that is not disregarded for federal tax purposes. Enter the disregarded entity's name on the "Business name/disregarded entity name" line. If the owner of the disregarded entity is a foreign person, you must complete an appropriate Form W-8.
Note. Check the appropriate box for the federal tax classification of the person whose name is entered on the "Name" line (Individual/sole proprietor, Partnership, C Corporation, S Corporation, Trust/estate).
Limited Liability Company (LLC). If the person identified on the "Name" line is an LLC, check the "Limited liability company" box only and enter the appropriate code for the tax classification in the space provided. If you are an LLC that is treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes, enter "P " for partnership. If you are an LLC that has filed a Form 8832 or a Form 2553 to be taxed as a corporation, enter "C " for C corporation or "S " for S corporation. If you are an LLC that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under Regulation section 301.7701-3 (except for employment and excise tax), do not check the LLC box unless the owner of the LLC (required to be identified on the "Name" line) is another LLC that is not disregarded for federal tax purposes. If the LLC is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, enter the appropriate tax classification of the owner identified on the "Name" line.

Form W-9 (Rev. 1-2011)

Other entities. Enter your business name as shown on required federal tax documents on the "Name" line. This name should match the name shown on the charter or other legal document creating the entity. You may enter any business, trade, or DBA name on the "Business name/ disregarded entity name" line.
Exempt Payee
If you are exempt from backup withholding, enter your name as described above and check the appropriate box for your status, then check the "Exempt payee" box in the line following the " Business name/ disregarded entity name," sign and date the form.
Generally, individuals (including sole proprietors) are not exempt from backup withholding. Corporations are exempt from backup withholding for certain payments, such as interest and dividends.
Note. If you are exempt from backup withholding, you should still complete this form to avoid possible erroneous backup withholding.
The following payees are exempt from backup withholding:
1. An organization exempt from tax under section 501(a), any IRA, or a custodial account under section 403(b)(7) if the account satisfies the requirements of section 401(f)(2),
2. The United States or any of its agencies or instrumentalities,
3. A state, the District of Columbia, a possession of the United States, or any of their political subdivisions or instrumentalities,
4. A foreign government or any of its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, or
5. An international organization or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.
Other payees that may be exempt from backup withholding include:

13. A financial institution,
14. A middleman known in the investment community as a nominee or custodian, or

Part I. Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)
Enter your TIN in the appropriate box. If you are a resident alien and you do not have and are not eligible to get an SSN, your TIN is your IRS individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Enter it in the social security number box. If you do not have an ITIN, see How to get a TIN below.
If you are a sole proprietor and you have an EIN, you may enter either your S SN or EIN. However, the IRS prefers that you use your SSN.
If you are a single-member LLC that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner (see Limited Liability Company (LLC) on page 2), enter the owner's S SN (or EIN, if the owner has one). Do not enter the disregarded entity's EIN. If the LLC is classified as a corporation or partnership, enter the entity's EIN.
Note. See the chart on page 4 for further clarification of name and TIN combinations.
How to get a TIN. If you do not have a TIN, apply for one immediately. To apply for an SSN, get Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card, from your local Social Security Administration office or get this form online at www.ssa.gov. You may also get this form by calling 1-800-772-1213. Use Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to apply for an ITIN, or Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, to apply for an EIN. You can apply for an EIN online by accessing the IRS website at www.irs.gov/businesses and clicking on Employer Identification Number (EIN) under Starting a Business. You can get Forms W-7 and SS-4 from the IRS by visiting IRS.gov or by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676).
If you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, write "Applied For" in the space for the TIN, sign and date the form, and give it to the requester. For interest and dividend payments, and certain payments made with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60 days to get a TIN and give it to the requester before you are subject to backup withholding on payments. The 60-day rule does not apply to other types of payments. You will be subject to backup withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to the requester.
Note. Entering "Applied For" means that you have already applied for a TIN or that you intend to apply for one soon.
Caution: A disregarded domestic entity that has a foreign owner must use the appropriate Form W-8.
Part II. Certification
To establish to the withholding agent that you are a U.S. person, or resident alien, sign Form W-9. You may be requested to sign by the withholding agent even if item 1, below, and items 4 and 5 on page 4 indicate otherwise.
For a joint account, only the person whose TIN is shown in Part I should sign (when required). In the case of a disregarded entity, the person identified on the "Name" line must sign. Exempt payees, see Exempt Payee on page 3.
Signature requirements. Complete the certification as indicated in items 1 through 3, below, and items 4 and 5 on page 4.
1. Interest, dividend, and barter exchange accounts opened before 1984 and broker accounts considered active during 1983. You must give your correct TIN, but you do not have to sign the certification.
2. Interest, dividend, broker, and barter exchange accounts opened after 1983 and broker accounts considered inactive during 1983. You must sign the certification or backup withholding will apply. If you are subject to backup withholding and you are merely providing your correct TIN to the requester, you must cross out item 2 in the certification before signing the form.
3. Real estate transactions. You must sign the certification. You may cross out item 2 of the certification.

Form W-9 (Rev. 1-2011)

4. Other payments. You must give your correct TIN, but you do not have to sign the certification unless you have been notified that you have previously given an incorrect TIN. "Other payments" include payments made in the course of the requester's trade or business for rents, royalties, goods (other than bills for merchandise), medical and health care services (including payments to corporations), payments to a nonemployee for services, payments to certain fishing boat crew members and fishermen, and gross proceeds paid to attorneys (including payments to corporations).
5. Mortgage interest paid by you, acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, qualified tuition program payments (under section 529), IRA, Coverdell ESA, Archer MSA or HSA contributions or distributions, and pension distributions. You must give your correct TIN, but you do not have to sign the certification.

Secure Your Tax Records from Identity Theft
Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information such as your name, social security number (SSN), or other identifying information, without your permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. An identity thief may use your SSN to get a job or may file a tax return using your SSN to receive a refund.
To reduce your risk:
· Protect your SSN,
· Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN, and
· Be careful when choosing a tax preparer.
If your tax records are affected by identity theft and you receive a notice from the IRS, respond right away to the name and phone number printed on the IRS notice or letter.
If your tax records are not currently affected by identity theft but you think you are at risk due to a lost or stolen purse or wallet, questionable credit card activity or credit report, contact the IRS Identity Theft Hotline at 1-800-908-4490 or submit Form 14039.
For more information, see Publication 4535, Identity Theft Prevention and Victim Assistance.
Victims of identity theft who are experiencing econom ic harm or a system problem, or are seeking help in resolving tax problems that have not been resolved through normal channels, may be eligible for Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) assistance. You can reach TAS by calling the TAS toll-free case intake line at 1-877-777-4778 or TTY/TDD 1-800-829-4059.
Protect yourself from suspicious emails or phishing schemes. Phishing is the creation and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business emails and websites. The most common act is sending an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft.
The IRS does not initiate contacts with taxpayers via emails. Also, the IRS does not request personal detailed information through email or ask taxpayers for the PIN numbers, passwords, or similar secret access information for their credit card, bank, or other financial accounts.
If you receive an unsolicited email claiming to be from the IRS, forward this message to phishing@irs.gov. You may also report misuse of the IRS name, logo, or other IRS property to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration at 1-800-366-4484. You can forward suspicious emails to the Federal Trade Commission at: spam@uce.gov or contact them at www.ftc.gov/idtheft or 1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338).
