The 2009 Bond is a secured bond issue with an outstanding amount of NOK 50 000 000 maturing on 10 December 2010. On 7 August 2009 the Maturity Date was extended from 10 December 2009 to 10 December 2010. The Loan is secured by a first priority pledge over the shares in the subsidiaries Aladdin Oil & Gas Cyprus (Cyprus) and Larchbay Traders & consultants Ltd (Cyprus), and a first priority pledge over the inter company loans to the Cyprus Subsidiaries and the Russian Subsidiaries. The last interest payment that was performed as cash payment was on 10 June 2009, while the interest payment due on 10 December 2009 was paid in the form of bonds in the 2010 Bond (defined and described below).
· ISIN: N0001056143.4 - 18.00 per cent Aladdin Oil & Gas Company ASA Unsecured PIK Bonds 2009/2010 (the "2010 Bond"). The 2010 Bond is an unsecured bond issue with an outstanding amount of NOK 3 250 000 maturing on 10 March 2010. The 2010 Bond was established in connection with the interest payment of the 2009 Bond scheduled for December 2009, which was paid by way of bonds in the 2010 Bond.
· ISIN: N0001036650.3 - 11.50 per cent Aladdin Oil & Gas Company ASA Senior Unsecured Bond Issue 2007/2011 with Warrants (the "2011 Bond"). The 2011 Bond is an unsecured bond issue with an outstanding amount of NOK 37 500 000 maturing on 2 May 2011. The last interest payment performed 2 May 2009.
· ISIN: N0001054567.6 - 11.50 per cent Aladdin Oil & Gas Company ASA Callable Bond Issue 2009/2012 (the "2012 Bond"). The 2012 Bond is a secured bond issue with an outstanding amount of NOK 27 500 000 maturing on 2 May 2012. The Loan is secured by a first priority pledge over the shares in the subsidiary Stikito Ltd (Cyprus). The last interest payment performed 2 May 2009.
· According to the Borrower the 2009 Bond, 2010 Bond, 2011 Bond and 2012 Bond constitutes the entire debt of the Borrower.
2. The Proposal:
In brief, the Borrower proposes to improve the liquidity situation by (i) extending the Maturity of the Bond Issues; and (ii) by paying already accrued interest, as well as parts of some future interest payments, not in cash, but in the form of bonds in a new bond issue that shall be converted to shares in the Borrower; and (iii) by cancelling scheduled instalments on the Loans; and (iv) through a new Equity Issue. To accommodate a new equity issue, the Borrowers further asks for a time limited waiver for the change of control put options for the Loans that have such clauses. The put could otherwise defeat the purpose of the equity issue. The Borrower also offers to undertake stricter covenants of the Loan agreements. The Borrower undertakes to show reasonable effort to, as soon as practically possible, establish a second priority pledge over the shares in Stikito in favor of the 2011 Bond (as held by the 2012 Bond on first priority), on priority behind the 2012 Bond, and on priority behind any future pledges made to farm-out partners in connection with farm-out agreements for the Stikito Licenses. If the Borrower documents that the pledges cannot legally be established with the required carve outs, the requirement to establish the second priority pledge shall
-2-

NORSK TILLITSM ANN ASA
lapse. In light of the restrictions the 3tii6ter tbvenants places on the Borrower, the Borrower proposes to introduce a call option for the 2011 Bond, which provides the Borrower with the option to redeem the bonds to lift the restrictions. The 2009 Bond and 2012 Bond already have call options.
As part of the restructuring the Borrower shall carry out an equity issue of minimum NOK 30 000 000 at a maximum subscription price of NOK 2 per share (the "Equity Issue"). The Borrower has informed the Loan Trustee that as of 25 February 2010, NOK 41 000 000 was subscribed for, but not paid in, at an issue price of NOK 1 per share. According to the Borrower, the subscription in the Equity Issue is made on the condition that the Proposed Restructuring is accepted by the Bondholders before the equity can be paid in.
The proposed restructuring consist of the elements described in paragraph 2, 3 and 4, hereunder the changes made to the terms and conditions of the Loans (the "Proposed Restructuring").
2.1. The 2009 Bond:
Extention of maturity and new term date structure The Maturity Date shall be extended by 15 months from 10 December 2010 to 10 March 2012.
The interest payment dates shall be amended from 10 June and 10 December each year, to 10 March and 10 September each year, to reflect the new Maturity Date. The transition will be made by an interest period running from 10 December 2009 to 25 February 2010, and an interest period running from 25 February 2010 until 10 September 2010. Consequently there will be no interest payment on 10 June 2010 as this is no longer an Interest Payment Date under the new term structure. (25 February has been set as a cut-off date close to the date of the Bondholders meeting).
Accrued Interest Interest accrued from the last Interest Payment Date (10 December 2009) to 25 February 2010 plus a premium of 10% of the accrued interest amount, shall be paid in the form of Waiver Fee Bonds. The Waiver Fee Bonds are described and defined below. An outline of the amount of Waiver Fee Bonds that the bondholders in each of the Loans shall receive is outlined in a separate paragraph.
Reduced Coupon For the period from and including 25 February 2010 until 10 March 2011 (the "Low Coupon Period"), the coupon shall be reduced by 5% p.a. from 13.00 % p.a. to 8.00 % p.a. The original coupon shall be reinstated upon expiry of the Low Coupon Period.
The nominal amount that the interest payments are reduced with during the Low Coupon Period, plus a premium of 10% of the reduction, shall be compensated in the form of Waiver Fee Bonds.
Cancel instalment The Borrower proposes to amend the amortization schedule of the 2009 Bond, by cancelling the NOK 5 000 000 instalment due 10 June 2010. The Borrower offers a compensation of 10% of the scheduled Installment (NOK 500 000) in the form of Waiver Fee Bonds for
-3 -

. NORSK TILLITSM ANN ASA
amending the amortization schedule:"'"' "uslfe110
Waiver of the Change of Control Put Option According to the Loan Agreement a Change of Control triggers a put option for the Bondholders. The Equity Issue that the Borrower is conducting may result in a Change of Control, but if a put option for the Bondholders is triggered, that may reduce the cash effect of the equity issue for the Borrower, and defeat the purpose of the Equity Issue. In light of the present liquidity challenges, the Borrower asks the Bondholders to waive the Change of Control put option of the Loan Agreement for a period of 6 - six - months from the date of the Bondholders' meeting. Any Change of Control occurring during this period shall not trigger a put option.
Stricter Covenants In an attempt to improve Bondholder protection in light of the waived Change of Control put option if a new dominant owner gains control over the Borrower, the Borrower (and the Borrower Group) shall undertake stricter covenants regarding sale or disposal of assets, mergers, demergers etc, by removing the exception for assets that are not substantial and for instances that do not have a material adverse effect on the Borrower's ability to comply with its' obligations.
hereunder, Clause 16.2 (b) shall be amended to read: "not, and ensure that no member of the Group shall: (i) sell or dispose of any part of its assets or operations, (ii) change the nature of its business, or (iii) merge, demerge or in any other way restructure its business, without the prior formal approval by a Bondholders' Meeting"
The Loan Agreements (For those bond issues that do not currently contain such restrictions) shall be amended to include the following covenants for the Borrower:
1) Restrictions on dividend payments from the Borrower to the shareholders until the Loans are repaid.
2) An undertaking by the Borrower that the Subsidiaries (direct or indirect) shall be 100% owned by the Borrower (direct or indirect). With the exception that for those subsidiaries where the Borrower presently holds less than 100% of the shares, the Borrower shall not hold less than the current ownership percentage.
3) The Borrower shall ensure that the Subsidiaries (direct or indirect) do not incur any new financial indebtedness toward parties that are not a member of the Group.
4) The Borrower shall ensure that any transaction made by the Borrower or by any member of the Borrower Group, with any party, is made on commercial terms and at fair market value, and on terms that are no less favourable to the to the member of the Group than those that might be obtained in an arms' length transaction at the time.
Waiver to accommodate Security for other Bonds, etc It is proposed that the Bondholders waive the additional debt restrictions and negative pledge of Clause 16.2. e) and 16.2. i) of the Loan Agreement, and waive such other clauses of the Loan Agreements that would inhibit the implementation of the Proposed Restructuring, to the extent necessary to implement the elements of the Proposed Restructuring, hereunder to establish the offered second priority pledge in favour of the 2011 Bond.

Coupon payments, the Borrower sh'alI,ha4nmentioned above, pay a waiver fee to the Bondholders (the "Waiver Fee"). Note that the Waiver Fee is not paid in cash, but in the form of Waiver Fee Bonds. The Waiver Fee for the 2009 Bond is calculated as follows:

Accrued interest from 10 December 2009 - 25 February 2010 Loss from reduced Coupon (5%) - 25 February 2010 - 10 March 2011 Sum Premium 10% flat Compensation 10% of cancelled instalment amount

The Waiver Fee Bonds are described in more detail under a separate paragraph below.

2.2. The 2011 Bond
Extention of maturity and new term date structure The Maturity Date shall be extended by 24 months from 2 May 2011 to 2 May 2013. The Loan shall continue with Interest Payment Dates on 2 May each year.
Accrued Interest Interest accrued from the last Interest Payment Date (2 May 2009) to 25 February 2010 plus a premium of 10% of the accrued interest amount, shall be paid in the form of Waiver Fee Bonds. The Waiver Fee Bonds are described and defined below. An outline of the amount of Waiver Fee Bonds that the bondholders in each of the Loans shall receive is outlined in a separate paragraph.
Reduced Coupon For the period from and including 25 February 2010 until 2 May 2011 (the "Low Coupon Period"), the coupon shall be reduced by 5% p.a. from 11.50 % p.a. to 6.50 % p.a. The original coupon shall be reinstated upon expiry of the Low Coupon Period.
The nominal amount that the interest payments are reduced with during the Low Coupon Period, plus a premium of 10% of the reduction, shall be compensated in the form of Waiver Fee Bonds.
The transition from the original Coupon to the Low Coupon Period will be made by an interest period running from the last previous Interest Payment Date to 25 February 2010, and an interest period running from 25 February 2010 until the next Interest Payment Date. (25 February has been set as an arbitrary cut-off date close to the date of the Bondholders meeting).
Introduce a Call Option The Borrower proposes to introduce an option to call the 2011 Bond at 101% of par, at any time. The Borrower shall, however, be restricted to redeem the 2009 Bond and 2012 Bond in full before the 2011 Bond can be redeemed through the Call.
Introduce a Change of Control Put Option The Borrower offers to amend the Loan Agreement to include a Change of Control Put Option that triggers a put option for the Bondholders in the event that a shareholder or a group of shareholders, or companies gain ownership or control of more than 50 % of the share capital
-5-

U l f NORSK TILLITSM ANN ASA
of the borrower. However, the Chafige1'df Cb'htrol clause shall not take effect before 6 - six months after the bondholders meeting, and any Change of Control event occurring before the clause becomes effective shall not trigger the put option.
Offer certain security for the Loan The Borrower undertakes to show reasonable effort to, as soon as practically possible, establish a second priority pledge over the shares in Stikito in favor of the 2011 Bond (as held by the 2012 Bond on first priority), on priority behind the 2012 Bond, and on priority behind any future pledges made to farm-out partners in connection with farm-out agreements for the Stikito Licenses. If the Borrower documents that the pledges cannot legally be established with the required carve outs, the requirement to establish the second priority pledge shall lapse.
Stricter Covenants In an attempt to improve Bondholder protection in light of the changes accepted by the Bondholders, the Borrower (and the Borrower Group) shall undertake stricter covenants regarding sale or disposal of assets, mergers, demergers etc, by removing the exception for assets that are not substantial and for instances that do not have a material adverse effect on the Borrower's ability to comply with its' obligations.
hereunder, Clause 16.2 (b) shall be amended to read: "not, and ensure that no member of the Group shall: (i) sell or dispose of any part of its assets or operations, (ii) change the nature of its business, or (iii) merge, demerge or in any other way restructure its business,
without the prior formal approval by a Bondholders' Meeting"
The Loan Agreements (For those bond issues that do not currently contain such restrictions) shall be amended to include the following covenants for the Borrower: .
1) Restrictions on dividend payments from the Borrower to the shareholders until the Loans are repaid.
2) An undertaking by the Borrower that the Subsidiaries (direct or indirect) shall be 100% owned by the Borrower (direct or indirect). With the exception that for those subsidiaries where the Borrower presently holds less than 100% of the shares, the Borrower shall not hold less than the current ownership percentage.
3) The Borrower shall ensure that the Subsidiaries (direct or indirect) do not incur any new financial indebtedness toward parties that are not a member of the Group.
4) The Borrower shall ensure that any transaction made by the Borrower or by any member of the Borrower Group, with any party, is made on commercial terms and at fair market value, and on terms that are no less favourable to the to the member of the Group than those that might be obtained in an arms' length transaction at the time.
General waiver to accommodate implementation of the Proposed Restructuring. It is proposed that the Bondholders waive any clauses of the Loan Agreement that would inhibit the implementation of the Proposed Restructuring, although only to the extent and for the time necessary to implement the elements of the Proposed Restructuring.
Calculation of the Waiver Fee for the 2009 Bond As compensation for the proposed changes to the terms of the Loans, hereunder the reduced Coupon payments, the Borrower shall, as mentioned above, pay a waiver fee to the Bondholders (the "Waiver Fee"). Note that the Waiver Fee is not paid in cash, but in the

2.3. The 2012 Bond
Extention of maturity and new term date structure The Maturity Date shall be extended by 6 months from 2 May 2012 to 2 November 2012.
The interest payment dates shall be amended from 2 May each year, to 2 November each year, to reflect the new Maturity Date. The transition will be made by an interest period running from 2 May 2009 to 25 February 2010, and an interest period running from 25 February 2010 until 2 November 2010. Consequently there will be no interest payment on 2 May 2010 as this is no longer an Interest Payment Date under the new term structure. (25 February has been set as an arbitrary cut-off date close to the date of the Bondholders meeting).
Accrued Interest Interest accrued from the last Interest Payment Date (2 May 2009) to 25 February 2010 plus a premium of 10% of the accrued interest amount, shall be paid in the form of Waiver Fee Bonds. The Waiver Fee Bonds are described and defined below. An outline of the amount of Waiver Fee Bonds that the bondholders in each of the Loans shall receive is outlined in a separate paragraph.
Reduced Coupon For the period from and including 25 February 2010 until 2 November 2010 (the "Low Coupon Period"), the coupon shall be reduced by 5% p.a. from 11.50 % p.a. to 6.50 % p.a. The original coupon shall be reinstated upon expiry of the Low Coupon Period.
The nominal amount that the interest payments are reduced with during the Low Coupon Period, plus a premium of 10% of the reduction, shall be compensated in the form of Waiver Fee Bonds.
Waiver of the Change of Control Put Option According to the Loan Agreement a Change of Control triggers a put option for the Bondholders. The Equity issue that the Borrower is conducting may result in a Change of Control, but if a put option for the Bondholders is triggered, that may reduce the cash effect of the equity issue for the Borrower, and defeat the purpose of the Equity Issue. In light of the present liquidity challenges, the Borrower asks the Bondholders to waive the Change of Control put option of the Loan Agreement for a period of 6 - six - months from the date of the Bondholders' meeting. Any Change of Control occurring during this period shall not trigger a put option.

Hereunder, but not limited to, the negative pledge clause to establish the offered second priority pledge in favour of the 2011 Bond, and the no additional debt clause to establish the Waiver Fee Bonds.

Calculation of the Waiver Fee for the 2012 Bond As compensation for the proposed changes to the terms of the Loans, hereunder the reduced Coupon payments, the Borrower shall, as mentioned above, pay a waiver fee to the Bondholders (the "Waiver Fee").

In August 2008 Aladdin Oil & Gas Co. ASA (AOG) signed an agreement (LOI) with Venatino Trading Ltd.(Venatino), where Venatino committed to subscribe for 20 102 153 shares at NOK 7.70 per share in AOG. The subscription would have brought AOG NOK 154.8 million in fresh capital. Following a number of delayed subscriptions from Venatino, it was finally in July 2009 AOG learned that Venatino would not fulfill its obligation. At that time Venatino had subscribed for approximately half of their shares. AOG has since raised equity through existing shareholders and Lakeshore International Buyout Fund (Lakeshore) at significantly lower prices per shares. Most of the offerings have been done at NOK 0.50 per share. AOG has for a long period been underfunded and has as a result not been able to fulfill the investment objectives on their licenses. This has created delayed progressions for the company resulting in delayed revenue streams.
AOG has over the last year been looking to diversify its equity funding, but with limited success. The feedback received from potential investors is the need for a new debt structure which allows for more capital to be applicable to Capex. The company's main sponsors since July 2009 have been the existing shareholders. AOG is very pleased with their continued support and without them AOG might not have existed today. Our largest shareholder is currently Lakeshore, who owns approximately 23 mill shares. Total outstanding shares are today approximately 93 million. AOG's bond issues, launched in 2007 are getting closer to maturity. Our plan to refinance existing bond issues with bank loans has proven difficult, in particular given the delayed revenue stream we have encountered. AOG has previously made changes to 2 of our 3 bond issues through Norsk Tillitsmann by extending maturity by 1 year and offering pledge in assets. AOG believes strongly in respecting our bondholders invested capital through principal protection- something the company intend to continue with.
AOG entire debt consist of 4 bond issue with a total face value of NOK 118.250 000. We now wish to restructure our entire debt profile in order to give the company more ability to execute its business plan, ease our refinancing strains, amend our interest service obligations, and to be able to attract hard needed additional equity. Our proposal offered to our bond holders is to extend and amend our debt profile in order to:
· Speed up our work program. The investment program in our assets has been delayed due to failure of Venatino to fulfill its investment in AOG. Since early 2009 significant time has been spent on dealing with our shortfall of capital at the expense of operational focus. We have currently 54 mboe in 2P reserves (see separate description). By giving us less financial obligations, more capital can be used to bring those reserves to producing status, which will accelerate the time to become EBITDA positive. We estimate we will reach a production level above EBITDA break -even level end of H1 2010.

· Interest service. The coupons on our bond issues are currently 13 % and 11.5 %. These interest payments are high for a company with low revenue stream. The interest payments create a drain on our capital - money that should ideally be allocated to investments in our licenses. We wish to reduce our coupons by 5 % each for a period of time and compensate the coupon loss with equity. This still gives our bond investor interest payments on a regular basis while also providing them with the opportunity to participate in a potential equity upside. AOG is currently trading at an EV/2P multiple of 0.5X, while the averages of small cap oil companies in Russia are trading at 3X.
· Attract equity. Equity investor will not commit any capital to AOG if the proceeds were to service interest obligations, amortizations or pay off maturing debt. Therefore we could easily come to a situation where our access to capital gets very hard/ impossible. We have approximately 16 million of interest payments and amortization in May/June 2010 alone. We have a further 48 million of redemption and interest payments in December this year. Beyond that we have approximately 45 million of redemption and interest payments in May 2011. Obviously that is a tall order. We wish to address those financing needs now, well in advance, in order to avoid a potential more significant restructuring in the future. Waiver of the "change of ownership" clause in the loan agreement is also necessary to deal with in order to not restrict our largest shareholder and main sponsor, Lakeshore, for further investments in AOG if needed.
This proposal has been thoroughly planned in order to give the company a capital structure that is bearable today and in the future. We have structured the extension of our debt in a way that gives the company ample time to deliver on its business strategy (see separate section). Finally, we have offered our bond investors a significant share of our equity as compensation for accepting our proposed structure. A total of NOK 15 million will be offered our bondholders through convertible bonds that will convert to shares in AOG (ticker: aogc) immediately. The conversion price will be identical to the offering price in the recent equity offering. Our main objectives in this process have been to come up with a workable debt profile and structure for the company that should not need to be amended in the future. We have also given significant weight to the fact that our bond investor's principal investment shall not be affected by this offer.

3. Future Outlook
The Company's work program for the year 2010-2013 focuses on starting and enhancing production from existing discovered fields. We estimate in our base case scenario to produce 3000-3500 boepd by 31.12.2010 whereas almost 50% of our production will come from our gas field. The oil production will come from our fields in Orenburg - Voinskoye and Nikiferovskoye fields. From the year 2011 and onwards we plan also to start developing our shallow oil as well as our second gas field in Ukhta as well as the the Besidinskoye filed in Orenburg area. For the licenses Bogdanovskaya and Veselovskoye we plan to look for a partner to develop the fields to reduce the company's capex requirement.
4. Base Case and projection summary
In our base case economical model the company assumes to produce about 50% of its 2P reserves. We believe this is a conservative assumption.
