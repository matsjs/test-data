DigiPlex
DigiPlex Rosenholm AS (the Company) Board of Directors' report
For the year ended 31 December 2015
Registration no. 994 817 477
We are pleased to present the 2015 annual financial report for the Company.
BACKGROUND DigiPlex Rosenholm AS forms part of the privately-owned DigiPlex Group of Companies, which specialises in building and operating data centres in the Nordic region. Founded in 2000, the Group is one of the longest standing data centre builders and operators in Europe, with companies registered in Finland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The Group provides safe, secure and future ready IT housing for our customers' mission critical systems. This is not a one-size-fitsall service but one that is tailored to suit each customer's individual needs
The Company operates from a facility in Rosenholm, Oslo, Norway. The facility was fully renovated in 2010 into 1,500m2of white space. It has a large range of clients from various sectors including the government, telecommunications and corporates.
BUSINESS ACTIVITIES Throughout 2015 the Company has continued investing in and operating from the facility at Rosenholm in Oslo providing a secure IT Housing service for its clients.
GOING CONCERN Notwithstanding that the Company's equity is in a negative position (NOK 15.1 million), the Board confirms that there are sufficient funds available to the Company from its operating revenue and its existing funding arrangement to operate as a going concern.
The Board have evaluated the Company's value adjusted equity. The valuation of the building and infrastructure was based on external advice, and the Board conclude that the market value of the Company's equity is positive.
The shareholder loan agreement does not contain restrictive covenants. Although the loan is stated to be payable on demand, there are contractual restrictions that restrict repayment thereof.
During 2015, the Company provided a guarantee for a bond loan issued by a related company, DigiPlex Norway AS (DNAS). The extent of the guarantee is limited to the quantum of outstanding monies advanced by DNAS, in accordance with the loan agreement between the respective entities (currently circa NOK 123 million). The bond loan agreement provides that the quantum of any dividends or loan repayments to the parent is limited to NOK 20 million per year, and is subject to a combined minimum liquidity requirement. A loan of NOK 20 million was advanced by DNAS to its parent in 2015.
As at the date of this report, the Board do not have any reason to believe that either the Company's bondholders or its shareholders do not support the going concern of the Company.
Consequently, the Board is of the opinion that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the activities of the Company.

In accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act section 3-3, the Board confirms that the conditions for continued operations as a going concern are present for the Company and that the annual financial statements have been prepared on that basis.
INCOME STATEMENT AND STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION The Directors have noted continued improvement in market conditions. The Company has improved its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation during 2015. The loss for the year amounts to NOK 0.8 million (2014: NOK 2.7 million).
The Company can report that 2015 revenue was 21% higher than 2014. Operating income is 13% (2014: 8%) of revenues, which was driven by strict control of operating expenses such as site operation and maintenance costs. Total earned equity as of 31 December 2015 is negative NOK 15.1 million (2014: negative NOK 14.3 million). The Company's financials are as expected. Due to the signing of several new contracts and effective cost control the Company's outlook is positive.
CAPITAL AND FINANCING Net cash inflow for the year was NOK 11.4 million (2014: NOK 2.5 million). Cash inflow from operating activities amounted to NOK 20.2 million (2014: NOK 3.6 million). Cash outflow to investing activities amounted to NOK 7.9 million (2014: NOK 10.5 million) and cash outflow to financing activities amounted to NOK 0.9 million (2014: cash inflow of NOK 9.4 million). A detailed cash flow statement is included in the financial statements.
The difference between operating results and cash flow from operating activities mainly relates to depreciation and change in trade receivable. The Company's investments are financed primarily via its operating cash flow.
The Company borrowed NOK 123.8 million from DNAS, in connection with a bond issue in the name of DNAS, which is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange, for which it provides a guarantee limited to the amount advanced. The loan was used to repay the existing term loan and a part repayment of the shareholder loan. The bonds are due to mature in July 2019. DNAS may redeem these bonds in part or in full, in accordance with the terms of the Bond Agreement.
The Company is making interest payments to DNAS in accordance with a loan agreement drawn up on similar terms to the Bond Agreement.
No interest is due on the shareholder related party loans and no principal payments were due in 2015. At balance sheet date, shareholder loans of NOK 135.5 million were outstanding.
The Board is satisfied with the current financial resources available to the Company.
RISKS The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks namely; market risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Company's financial performance. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge any risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the Company's finance department under policies approved by the Board. The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.

Market risk
The Company operates nationally and is therefore exposed to a limited foreign exchange risk.
However its interest rate risk arises from a long term bond loan (see note 2). Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk. The interest on the loan is adjusted quarterly. The Company also holds borrowings issued by the shareholder. The shareholder loan is not interest bearing.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. Management assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. Credit risk related to bank insolvency is closely monitored.
Liquidity risk
The Company's finance department monitors rolling forecasts of the Company's liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs, while maintaining sufficient headroom at all times so that the Company does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.
The Board is not aware of any additional financial risk factors facing the Company other than those outlined in this report.
HEALTH, SAFETY AND WORK ENVIRONMENT As of 31 December 2015, the Company employed 5 full time staff of which there were 4 males and 1 female. None of those employees were in a leading management positions. The Company gives equal opportunities to its employees regardless of gender and will continue this policy in the future.
The Company aims to conduct its operations with zero injuries through effective risk management. The Company considers the working environment as positive and there have been no serious work incidents or accidents resulting in personal injury or damages to material or equipment during the course of 2015. The Company also maintains a log of sick leave days taken and the absence percentage due to sick leave for 2015 was 1.1%.
All employees are part of a pension scheme.
EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT Within our environmental impact it is energy use and consequently carbon emissions that determine the biggest part of our environmental agenda. The Company is committed to operating sustainably with continuous improvements in environmental performance.
The initial target for the DigiPlex Group of Companies in Norway was to purchase all electricity from certified, renewable sources. We achieved this in July 2004 and have maintained this achievement ever since.
FUTURE READY
IT-HOUSIIMG

DigiPlex
We particularly welcome the opportunity to work with our customers and help them to achieve their own environmental performance improvement goals. With the above processes and initiatives in place, the Board is very proud of the small environmental footprint that it leaves behind.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY The Company's policy is to recruit and manage on the basis of competence and performance regardless of age, nationality, race, gender, religious beliefs, sexuality, physical ability or cultural background.
The Company is committed to maintaining an open working environment in which employees and contractors are able to report instances of unethical, unlawful or undesirable conduct without fear of intimidation or reprisal.
The Company's tendering process clarifies whether the supplier has established its own policy and guidelines for corporate social responsibility, and whether it has been involved in incidents related to corruption, child labour or breaches of human rights or the rights of employees to unionise.
Information on such matters is obtained from the suppliers themselves or from internet searches. Possible conditions uncovered will be significant in qualifying the supplier for participation in the tendering process.
The Board is not aware of any additional risk factors facing the Company other than those outlined in this report.

Accounting principles The annual accounts have been prepared in compliance with the Accounting Act and Norwegian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for small enterprises. Sales Revenues IT housing service revenues are recognised and expensed over the life time for each contract.
Classification and valuation of balance sheet items Assets intended for long term ownership or use have been classified as fixed assets. Assets relating to the trading cycle have been classified as current assets. Receivables are classified as current assets if they are to be repaid within one year after the transaction date. Similar criteria apply to liabilities. Current assets are valued at the lower of purchase cost and net realisable value. Short term liabilities are reflected in the balance sheet at nominal value on the establishment date.
Tangible assets Tangible assets are reflected in the balance sheet and depreciated to residual value over the asset's expected useful life on a straight line basis. If changes in the depreciation plan occur the effect is distributed over the remaining depreciation period. Direct maintenance of an asset is expensed under operating expenses as and when it is incurred. Additions or improvements are added to the asset's cost price and depreciated together with the asset. The split between maintenance and additions/improvements is calculated in proportion to the asset's condition at the acquisition date. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts, net of their residual values, over their estimated useful lives. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement for the period.
Debtors Trade debtors and other debtors are reflected in the balance sheet at nominal value less provisions for doubtful debts. Provisions for doubtful debts are calculated on the basis of individual assessments. In addition, for the remainder of accounts receivables outstanding balances, a general provision is carried out based on expected loss. Foreign currencies Monetary items in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Tax The tax charge in the income statement includes both payable taxes for the period and changes in deferred tax. Deferred tax is calculated at 25% on the basis of the temporary differences which exist between accounting and tax values, and any carry forward losses for tax purposes at the year-end. Tax enhancing or tax reducing temporary differences, which are reversed or may be reversed in the same period, have been eliminated. Deferred tax and tax benefits which may be shown in the balance sheet are presented on a net basis. The Company elected to capitalise the deferred tax advantage.
Cash Flow Statement The Cash Flow Statement is prepared using the indirect method. Cash available includes petty cash, deposits on bank accounts and other short term placements which can be transformed to cash within a short time.

With effect from 1 January 2016 the corporate tax rate reduced from 27% to 25%. Temporary differences and tax carried forward have been re-calculated with the new tax rate on 31 December 2015.

Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax base used in the calculation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

The Company's carry forward tax loss as at 31 December 2015 amounts to NOK 68,801,578 and represents a significant value. The Company has decided to capitalise 25% of the tax loss showing a deferred tax advantage in the balance sheet amounting to NOK 6,739,427. This decision was made on the basis that the Company prepared a long term business plan. This plan forecasts a profitable position over the coming years (based on existing/potential customer contracts) and as such the Company intends to utilise the deferred tax advantage over the next ten years.
