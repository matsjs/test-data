Dear Sirs,
PANORO ENERGY ASA SENIOR SECURED CALLABLE BOND ISSUE 2010/2018 NOTICE OF POSSIBLE MANDATORY PREPAYMENT EVENT
We refer to the bond issue Panoro Energy ASA Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2010/2018 (the "Bond Issue") as governed by the bond agreement dated 15 November 2010 (the "Bond Agreement") between ourselves as Issuer and Norsk Tillitsmann ASA as Bond Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Bond Agreement.
We refer to the stock exchange notification dated today (the "Stock Exchange Notice") regarding the sale by the Issuer of its wholly owned subsidiary Rio das Contas Produtora de Petroleo Ltda (the "Asset Subsidiary") to GeoPark Holdings Limited (or its affiliates) ("Geopark") (the "Transaction").
As set out in the Stock Exchange Notice, the completion of the Transaction will constitute a Mandatory Prepayment Event under the Bond Agreement. In accordance with the mandatory prepayment obligation under clause 10.4.1 of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer will, on the date the sale proceeds are received, apply such funds directly towards the discharge of the Outstanding Bonds.
As for the timing of the Transaction and the mandatory prepayment, the Transaction as well as the occurrence of the Mandatory Prepayment Event, is conditional on, inter alia, a regulatory approval from Agéncia Nacional do Petroleo, Gås Natural e Biocombustiveis (the "ANP"). Such approval is expected to take between four to nine months, but may also take shorter or longer time and the Issuer expects that this will be the last condition to be fulfilled.

The price payable by the Issuer on the mandatory prepayment will in accordance with clause 10.4.1 of the Bond Agreement depend on which date the Mandatory Prepayment Event occurs. The Issuer is committed to keeping the Bondholders updated on the progress towards completion, when the final ANP approval is obtained and when mandatory prepayment can be expected. Yours faithfully, Panoro Energy ASA
