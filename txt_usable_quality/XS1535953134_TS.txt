Swedbank AB (publ)
(Incorporated with limited liability in the Kingdom of Sweden)
U.S.$500,000,000 Fixed Rate Reset Additional Tier 1 Convertible Notes
The U.S.$500,000,000 Fixed Rate Reset Additional Tier 1 Convertible Notes (the "Notes") will be issued by Swedbank AB (publ) (the "Issuer"). Subject as provided in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes", the Notes will constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, as described in Condition 2 (Status) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes".
The Notes will bear interest, payable semi-annually in arrear on 17 March and 17 September in each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), from (and including) 16 December 2016 (the "Issue Date") to (but excluding) 17 March 2022 (the "First Call Date") at the rate of 6.000 per cent. per annum. There will be a short first Interest Period. The first payment of interest will be made on 17 March 2017 in respect of the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) such Interest Payment Date. The rate of interest will reset on the First Call Date and on each Reset Date (as defined in Condition 19 (Interpretation) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes"). See Condition 3 (Interest) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes".
Interest on the Notes is due and payable only at the sole and absolute discretion of the Issuer, and the Issuer shall have sole and absolute discretion at all times to cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment that would otherwise be due and payable on any Interest Payment Date. Interest may also be deemed to have been so cancelled in certain circumstances and the Issuer will also be obliged to cancel interest in certain circumstances. See Condition 4 (Interest Cancellation) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes".
The Notes are perpetual securities and have no fixed date for redemption and holders of the Notes ("Noteholders") do not have the right to call for their redemption. Subject as provided herein, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, on the First Call Date or on any Reset Date thereafter at their principal amount, together with accrued but unpaid interest (which excludes any interest cancelled or deemed cancelled). Subject as provided herein, the Issuer may also, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time at their principal amount, together with accrued but unpaid interest (which excludes any interest cancelled or deemed cancelled) upon the occurrence of a Tax Event or Capital Event (each as defined in Condition 19 (Interpretation) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes"). Any such redemption is subject to certain conditions. See Condition 6 (Redemption and Purchase) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes".
If at any time a Capital Event or a Tax Event occurs, the Issuer may either substitute all (but not some only) of the Notes or vary the terms of the Notes accordingly, without any requirement for the consent or approval of the Noteholders, so that they remain or become Qualifying Additional Tier 1 Securities (as defined in Condition 19 (Interpretation) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes"). See Condition 15 (Substitution or Variation instead of Redemption).
If the CET1 Ratio (as defined in Condition 19 (Interpretation) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes") of either the Issuer or the Group (as defined in Condition 19 (Interpretation) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes") falls below 5.125 per cent. or 8.00 per cent. respectively (a "Trigger Event"), the Notes will be automatically converted into Conversion Shares at the Conversion Price (each as defined in Condition 19 (Interpretation) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes"). See Condition 5 (Loss Absorption Mechanism) in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes".
This Offering Circular does not comprise a prospectus for the purposes of Article 5.3 of Directive 2003/71/EC as amended (which includes the amendments made by Directive 2010/73/EU to the extent that such amendments have been implemented in a relevant Member State of the European Economic Area (the "EEA")).
Application has been made to the Irish Stock Exchange plc (the "Irish Stock Exchange") for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List and trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange. This Offering Circular constitutes listing particulars for the purpose of such application and has been approved by the Irish Stock Exchange.
The Notes are not intended to be sold and should not be sold to retail clients in the EEA, as defined in the rules set out in the Product Intervention (Contingent Convertible Instruments and Mutual Society Shares) Instrument 2015 (as amended or replaced from time to time) other than in circumstances that do not and will not give rise to a contravention of those rules by any person. Prospective investors are referred to the section headed "Restrictions on marketing and sales to retail investors" on page 2 of this Offering Circular for further information.
The Notes and any Conversion Shares to be delivered following the occurrence of a Trigger Event have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and are subject to U.S. tax law requirements. Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or to U.S. persons. The Notes may be offered and sold outside the United States to non U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S ("Regulation S") under the Securities Act. For a description of certain restrictions on offers, sales and deliveries of the Notes and on the distribution of this Offering Circular and other offering material relating to the Notes, see "Subscription and Sale".
The Notes are expected to be rated BBB by Standard & Poor's Credit Markets Services Europe Limited ("S&P"), BBB by Fitch Ratings Ltd. ("Fitch") and Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service Limited ("Moody's"). Each of S&P, Fitch and Moody's is established in the European Union (the "EU") and is registered under Regulation (EC) No. 1060/2009 (as amended) (the "CRA Regulation") and is included in the list of credit rating agencies registered in accordance with the CRA Regulation as of the date of this Offering Circular. This list is available on the European Securities and Markets Authority's website at www.esma.europa.eu/page/List-registered-and-certified-CRAs. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.
The Notes will initially be in the form of a temporary global note (the "Temporary Global Note"), without interest coupons ("Coupons"), which will be deposited on or around the Issue Date with a common depositary for Euroclear Bank SA/Nv ("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking S.A. ("Clearstream, Luxembourg"). Interests in the Temporary Global Note will be exchangeable for interests in a permanent global note (the "Permanent Global Note" and, together with the Temporary Global Note, the "Global Notes"), without Coupons, on or after 26 January 2017 (the "Exchange Date"), upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership. Interests in the Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable for Notes in definitive form ("Definitive Notes") only in certain limited circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Permanent Global Note. Definitive Notes will have attached Coupons and, if necessary, talons ("Talons") for further Coupons - see "Summary of Provisions relating to the Notes while in Global Form".
An investment in the Notes involves certain risks. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should ensure that they understand the nature of the Notes and the extent of their exposure to risks and that they consider the suitability of the Notes as an investment in the light of their own circumstances and financial condition.

IMPORTANT NOTICE

Restrictions on marketing and sales to retail investors

The Notes discussed in this Offering Circular are complex financial instruments and are not a suitable or appropriate investment for all investors. In some jurisdictions, regulatory authorities have adopted or published laws, regulations or guidance with respect to the offer or sale of securities such as the Notes to retail investors.

In particular, in June 2015, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the "FCA") published the Product Intervention (Contingent Convertible Instruments and Mutual Society Shares) Instrument 2015 which took effect on 1 October 2015. Under the rules set out in the PI Instrument (as amended or replaced from time to time, the "PI Rules"), certain contingent write-down or convertible securities (including any beneficial interests therein), such as the Notes must not be sold to retail clients in the EEA; and there must not be any communication or approval of an invitation or inducement to participate in, acquire or underwrite such securities (or the beneficial interest in such securities) where that invitation or inducement is addressed to or disseminated in such a way that it is likely to be received by a retail client in the EEA (in each case, within the meaning of the PI Rules), other than in accordance with the limited exemptions set out in the PI Rules. Each of BNP Paribas, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, HSBC Bank plc, J.P. Morgan Securities plc, Swedbank AB (publ) (in its capacity as a joint lead manager) and UBS Limited (together, the "Joint Lead Managers") is required to comply with the PI Rules. In addition, by purchasing, or making or accepting an offer to purchase, any Notes from the Issuer and/or the Joint Lead Managers, each prospective investor in relation to the Notes represents, warrants, agrees with and undertakes to the Issuer and each of the Joint Lead Managers that:

(i)

it is not a retail client in the EEA (as defined in the PI Rules);

(ii)

whether or not it is subject to the PI Rules, it will not sell or offer the Notes (or any beneficial interests

therein) to retail clients in the EEA or communicate (including the distribution of this Offering Circular)

or approve an invitation or inducement to participate in, acquire or underwrite the Notes (or any

beneficial interests therein) where that invitation or inducement is addressed to or disseminated in

such a way that it is likely to be received by a retail client in the EEA (in each case within the meaning

of the PI Rules), other than (i) in relation to any sale of or offer tosell Notes to a retail client in or

resident in the United Kingdom, in circumstances that do not and will not give rise to a contravention

of the PI Rules by any person and/or (ii) in relation to any sale of or offer to sell Notes to a retail client

in any EEA member state other than the United Kingdom, where (a) it has conducted an assessment

and concluded that the relevant retail client understands the risks of an investment in the Notes and is

able to bear the potential losses involved in an investment in the Notes (or any beneficial interests

therein) and (b) it has at all times acted in relation to such sale or offer in compliance with the Markets

in Financial Instruments Directive (2004/39/EC) ("MiFID") to the extent it applies to it or, to the extent

MiFID does not apply to it, in a manner which would be in compliance with MiFID if it were to apply to

it; and

(iii)

it will at all times comply with all applicable laws, regulations and regulatory guidance (whether inside

or outside the EEA) relating to the promotion, offering, distribution and/or sale of the Notes, including

any such laws, regulations and regulatory guidance relating to determining the appropriateness

and/or suitability of an investment in the Notes by investors in any relevant jurisdiction.

Where acting as agent on behalf of a disclosed or undisclosed client when purchasing, or making or accepting an offer to purchase, any Notes from the Issuer and/or the Joint Lead Managers the foregoing representations, warranties, agreements and undertakings will be given by and be binding upon both the agent and its underlying client.

including where the currency for principal or interest payments, i.e. U.S. dollars, is different from the

currency in which such potential investor's financial activities are principally denominated;

(d)

understands thoroughly the terms of the Notes and is familiar with the behaviour of any relevant

indices and financial markets; and

(e)

is able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for

economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the

applicable risks.

and payable;

(C)

no Noteholder will have any rights against the Issuer with

respect to the repayment of the principal amount of the

and

(D)

subject to the last paragraph of Condition 5(d) (Settlement

See Condition 10 (Winding-Up, Non-payment, Breach of Obligations, Remedies). An Automatic Conversion shall not constitute an enforcement event, as described in Condition 10 (Winding-Up, Non payment, Breach of Obligations, Remedies) or a breach of the Issuer's obligations under the Terms and Conditions of the Notes or a failure to perform in any matter whatsoever and shall not entitle Noteholders to petition for the insolvency or dissolution of the Issuer or otherwise.

Meetings of Modifications:

Noteholders

and The Notes and the Agency Agreement contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.

In that event, the Issuer shall ((i) subject to the exceptions set out in Condition 9 (Taxation) and (ii) to the extent such payment can be made out of Distributable Items which are available mutatis mutandis in accordance with Condition 4(b) (Restriction on Interest Payments)) pay in respect of payments of interest (but not principal or any other amount) such additional amounts as will result in the Noteholders receiving such amounts as they would have received in respect of such Notes or Coupons had no such withholding or deduction been required.

Form of the Notes:

The Notes will be issued in bearer form and will initially be in the form of the Temporary Global Note, without Coupons, which will be deposited on or around the Issue Date with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Interests in the Temporary Global Note will be exchangeable for interests in the Permanent Global Note, without Coupons, on or after the Exchange Date, upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership.

See "Summary of Provisions relating to the Notes while in Global Form" below.

Substitution or Variation:

If at any time a Capital Event or a Tax Event occurs, the Issuer may either substitute all (but not some only) of the Notes or vary the terms of the Notes, without any requirement for the consent or approval of the Noteholders, so that they remain or become Qualifying Additional Tier 1 Securities. See Condition 15 (Substitution or Variation instead of Redemption) .

Denominations:

The Notes will be issued in the denominations of U.S.$200,000.

Risk Factors

Investing in the Notes involves certain risks. If any of the risks described below materialise, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer, and the trading price and liquidity of our Notes could decline, in which case you could lose some or all of the value of your investment. In addition, if certain of these risks or a combination of some of these risks materialise, interest payments on the Notes may be cancelled or the Notes may be mandatorily converted into shares as a result of a significant deterioration in our financial condition leading to additional losses in the value of your investment.

Words and expressions defined in the "Terms and Conditions of the Notes" below or elsewhere in this Offering Circular have the same meanings in this section.

References herein to the quarterly numbers for the nine month period ended 30 September 2016 are references to unaudited numbers.

2.1

Risks Relating to Swedbank

2.1.1

Worsening economic conditions in the countries where the Issuer and its subsidiaries (the "Swedbank Group") operate may adversely impact the Swedbank Group and are likely to continue to do so if those conditions persist or recur.

The Swedbank Group's performance is significantly influenced by the general ec onomic conditions in the countries in which it operates, in particular its primary markets of Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and, to a lesser degree, Norway. In 2013, Swedbank sold its operations in Russia and Ukraine, which had been severely hit by the economic downturn. The economic situation in all of the countries in which the Swedbank Group operates has in recent years been adversely affected in various ways by weakening economic conditions and the turmoil in the global financial markets. These countries have in the past few years experienced periods of declining economic growth or recessions, increasing rates of unemployment, and, in the case of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (together, the "Baltic countries"), decreasing lending volumes as well as decreasing asset values. A more aggressive Russian foreign policy and the planning of a new Russian gas line in the Baltic sea has raised the geopolitical risks in the region.

In addition to these trends, a significant risk facing the Swedish economy is the level of indebtedness held by Swedish households, which is at historically high levels. A lack of housing, low interest rates and higher house prices have led to a rapid increase in the volume of home lending. Households are therefore more sensitive to higher interest rates. Successive Swedish governments have implemented policies to attempt to mitigate these risks and secure financial stability but such measures may be inadequate or have unpredictable consequences. Attempts by regulators to slow the credit growth have been largely ineffectual in part because interest rates have continued to fall.

Any or all of the conditions described above could result in increased default rates and/or decreased lending activity which could have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's business, financial condition and results of operations

2.1.2

The Swedbank Group's business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the recent conditions in the global financial markets and uncertainties about the strength of the Eurozone.

The global capital and credit markets have been characterised by volatility and disruption in recent years. During the financial crisis in 2008 this resulted in liquidity constraints and other problems at many of the world's largest commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies, a number of which are the Swedbank Group's counterparties or customers in the ordinary course of its business. These conditions also resulted in a material reduction in the availability of financing, both

10

for the Swedbank Group as well as other financial institutions and their customers. The European Central Bank (the "ECB") implemented an asset purchase programme in March 2015, with monthly purchases of 60 billion. The programme was extended in March this year when the ECB lowered its repo rate and deposit rate to negative rates. The monthly purchases under the asset purchase programme ("QE") were expanded to 80 billion starting in April 2016. This is up from 60 billion a month previously. The measure is designed to stimulate growth in the Eurozone and raise inflation, which remains below target. Overall the liquidity situation in the Eurozone has become more favorable due to the ECB's expansionary monetary policy. Credit growth has also started to increase. The stress tests on the European banks implemented during the summer showed an improvement but with the weakest performance in Italy and also in respect of certain financial institutions in Germany.
U.S authorities' plans to impose a significant fine regarding the misselling of mortgage-backed securities on Deutsche Bank in the aftermath of the financial crisis 2007/08 have led to growing concern for Deutsche Bank's future. The future of Deutsche Bank will also have an impact on other European banks, such as Swedbank. The global outlook for 2016 has been revised down and the outlook from central banks appears more cautious for the long term. The U.S. Federal Reserve has revised down the interest path 2016/2017 and the Bank of England and Bank of Japan have introduced additional economic stimulus measures. A sluggish global growth and declining world trade will have a dampening impact on Swedish export industries.
Although the level of market disruption and volatility caused by the global financial crisis has abated to a certain extent, there are no assurances that these conditions will not recur or that similar events will not occur that have similar effects on the financial markets, in which case the Swedbank Group may experience reductions in business activity, increased funding costs, decreased liquidity, decreased asset values, additional credit impairment losses and lower profitability and revenues. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.
Global markets and economic conditions have been negatively impacted since 2010 by market perceptions regarding the ability of certain EU Member States to service their sovereign debt obligations, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Although the uncertainty over the outcome of the EU governments' financial support programmes has decreased, the long term view for public finance in Europe still faces many challenges, including those related to demographic trends and the uncertain impact of the increase in immigration. Any loosening of the political ties within the EU, such as the UK leaving the EU, could have negative impacts on the European economy and increase the volatility on the financial markets. This could also have political implications on cooperation within the EU.
Concerns about credit risk (including that of sovereigns) and the Eurozone crisis are influenced by the outlook on the global economy generally, as well as perceptions of the strength of the European banking sector. A slow down in China's economy could also negatively impact the global economy and Europe. EU-cooperation is facing growing challenges in the wake of the large increase of immigrants into Europe, sluggish growth and the impact of the UK leaving the EU. The United Kingdom government has declared its intention to serve notice under Article 50 of The EU Lisbon Treaty by the end of the first quarter of 2017. However, a prolonged lack of clarity on the details of the UK's exit from the EU, and uncertainty over trade arrangements, market access and legislative and regulatory frameworks, will likely result in continued market volatility and a deterioration in economic conditions in the UK with potential consequences in other markets. Oil prices have stabilised in 2016. The over-supply of oil has declined and the demand for oil has continued to increase in emerging markets. Major oil producers significantly revised their investment plans for the coming years which will gradually lead to a decline in oil supply. OPEC is also planning to reduce oil production. However, market fluctuations will continue and there can be no assurance that this will not have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's customers.
11

2.1.3 2.1.4

The impact of these conditions could be detrimental to the Swedbank Group and it could experience reductions in business activity, increased funding costs, decreased liquidity, decreased access to the wholesale funding markets, decreased asset values, additional credit impairment losses and lower profitability and revenues. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.
Swedish households may be exposed to a risk of a drop in house prices and changes in regulations applying to mortgages.
In recent years in Sweden, low interest rates, with real interest rates falling on mortgages in Sweden from 6 per cent to 1 per cent between 1995 and 2015, low inflation, higher house prices and increased disposable household income have led to continued strong growth in demand for loans, especially in the residential mortgage market. Demand for housing has increased rapidly in Sweden, partly as a result of rapid growth in the population over the past decade due to increases in immigration. The increase in immigration has affected demand for housing in the short term. Rapid urbanisation in Sweden has also contributed to an increase in the demand for housing in metropolitan areas and other growth regions. Apartment prices in Sweden also rose by 10.7 per cent in 2015 after having more than tripled since 2000. As prices have risen, buyers have taken on more mortgage debt, aided by low nominal interest rates and interest-only mortgages. Household debt rose to 173 per cent of disposable income at the end of 2015, after having hovered between 90 and 100 per cent throughout the previous decade. A large number of Swedish households therefore may be exposed to the risk of a drop in house prices and the Swedbank Group, through Swedbank Mortgage, is one of Sweden's leading mortgage lenders with a market share of 25 per cent as of 31 December 2015.
Furthermore, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the "Basel Committee") has recommended an international standard of 35 per cent risk weight for residential mortgages. In 2014, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (the "Swedish FSA") raised the risk weights on residential mortgages to 25 per cent from 15 per cent. In June 2016 the Swedish FSA introduced tighter amortisation requirements. Annual repayment on mortgages of at least two per cent will be made on loans until they reach a 70 per cent loan to value ratio and thereafter annual repayments of at least one per cent will be paid until loans reach a 50 per cent loan to value ratio. Still, the credit expansion to the household sector is growing far above growth in disposable income. Additional measures have not been decided but the Swedish FSA want to introduce a debt ceiling as share of household disposable income. Discussions about reductions in interest deduction have intensified but there is still no political consensus for that. The Central Bank of Sweden is concerned about the housing market and the increase in household lending and are asking for more macro prudential tools to be implemented. If macro prudential tools are too tight, this could have a negative impact both on Swedish growth and on the real estate market. Any defaults could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's business, financial condition and results of operations. For further detail around the impact of the risk weight floor, see "- Swedbank or its financial institution subsidiaries may need additional capital in the future to maintain capital adequacy ratios or for other reasons, and it may be difficult to obtain such capital."
Economic and market conditions have caused substantial credit impairments in the past, and future credit impairments could have a material adverse impact on the Swedbank Group's financial condition and results of operations.
The Swedbank Group is exposed to credit risk, or the risk that its borrowers may not repay their loans according to their contractual terms and that the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient. Further, there is a risk of declining market values that may affect the collateral securing the exposure. The Swedbank Group maintains provisions for credit impairments to cover estimated probable incurred credit impairments inherent in its loan portfolio. The Swedbank Group's allowance for credit impairments is based, among other things, on the Swedbank Group's portfolio provision models and analysis of current and historical delinquency rates, loan management, macroeconomic factors and the valuation of the underlying assets, as well as numerous other management

12

2.1.5

assumptions, which may prove to be inaccurate, resulting in further credit losses. Furthermore, the Swedbank Group is exposed to concentration risk, which means credit risk relating to large individual exposures or affiliated borrowers as well as significant exposures to groups of counterparties whose probability of default ("PD") is driven by common underlying factors, such as sector, economy, geographical location, or type of instrument. The impact of the concentration risk could have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.
If a borrower defaults under one of the Swedbank Group's loans, the Swedbank Group may foreclose on the loan and/or acquire title to the assets pledged as collateral, and thereafter, make substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximise the asset's realisable value. The borrower may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other compulsory measures, which may delay the foreclosure, or seek bankruptcy protection against the Swedbank Group. If the borrower seeks bankruptcy protection, certain regulatory measures may preclude the Swedbank Group from enforcing foreclosure or other remedies against the borrower. Foreclosure-related costs, high loan-to-value ratios or reductions in the value of the assets may prevent the Swedbank Group from realising an amount equal to its loans upon foreclosure, and the Swedbank Group may be required to record losses. Even if the Swedbank Group were able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing its exposures, the Swedbank Group may own title to pledged assets that it is unable to efficiently repossess or force a sale of, which would adversely affect the Swedbank Group's ability to recover the value of the collateral securing its exposure. Furthermore, the Swedbank Group may, as part of its foreclosure on business assets, end up acquiring collateral that is not core to the Swedbank Group's business and in respect of which it lacks required operational or management expertise or experience or may be prohibited from owning under applicable regulations. Managing such assets may be costly and may require additional expertise, personnel or outsourcing, options which may not be readily available or available at all. All of the above may adversely affect the Swedbank Group's financial condition and results of operations.
A significant amount of the Swedbank Group's long-term financing matures in the next 12 months, which the Swedbank Group may not have the ability to refinance.
A significant portion, roughly SEK 132 billion, or 19 per cent as at 30 September 2016, of the Swedbank Group's external long-term financing, including maturing subordinated debt, matures in the next 12 months. Disruptions, uncertainty and/or increased volatility in the global capital markets may have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's ability to raise new financing. This could have a significant adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's liquidity position, funding maturity profile and operating results. The availability of additional financing depends on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the availability of credit generally and, specifically for borrowers in the financial services industry, the volume of trading activities, the Swedbank Group's financial condition, its credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as any negative perception by the Swedbank Group's customers or lenders of the Swedbank Group's financial prospects if, for example, the Swedbank Group incurs large loan or other losses, experiences significant deposit outflows or if the level of the Swedbank Group's business activity decreases due to a market downturn. The Swedbank Group's access to funds may further be impaired if regulatory authorities impose additional regulatory capital requirements or if ratings agencies downgrade the credit ratings of Swedbank, such as in June 2014 when S&P and Moody's placed Swedbank and other Nordic banks on negative outlook due to a reduction in anticipated government support. For more information about recent regulatory changes to capital requirements, see "Swedbank or its financial institution subsidiaries may need additional capital in the future to maintain capital adequacy ratios or for other reasons, and it may be difficult to obtain such capital".

13

2.1.6 2.1.7 2.1.8 2.1.9

In addition, an increase in interest rates and/or widening of credit spreads, as well as the restriction on the availability of credit, including, but not limited to, interbank credit, can impact the Swedbank Group's ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis, which may have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's liquidity and results of operations. In difficult credit market conditions, the Swedbank Group may be forced to fund its operations at a higher cost or it may be unable to raise as much short- or long-term funding as it needs to support its business activities. This could cause the Swedbank Group to curtail its business activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's business and results of operations.
The Swedbank Group's guidelines and policies for risk management may prove to be inadequate with respect to unidentified and unforeseen risks.
The management of business, regulatory and legal risks requires, inter alia, guidelines and policies for the accurate registration and control of a large number of transactions and events. Such guidelines and policies may not always be adequate. Some methods used by the Swedbank Group to estimate, measure and manage risk are based on perceived historical market behaviour. The methods may therefore prove to be inadequate for predicting future risk exposure, which may differ from what is suggested by prior experience. Other methods for risk management are based on evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other information that is publicly known or otherwise available to the Swedbank Group. Such information has not always been, and may not always be, correct, updated or correctly evaluated and may therefore be inadequate for the purpose of risk management, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's financial condition and results of operations.
Any impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets would have a negative effect on the Swedbank Group's results of operations.
Swedbank performs impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets at least once a year or whenever there are indications for a decrease in value of goodwill or other intangible assets. The outcome of any impairment test model depends, among other things, on key input data on macroeconomic factors and long-term growth assumptions. Should the economic conditions worsen beyond what the Swedbank Group expected or should there be a change in regulatory conditions affecting the Swedbank Group's assets, either in any of the Swedbank Group's home markets or in general, an impairment charge relating to goodwill and other intangible assets may need to be recognised, which may have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Swedbank Group is financially exposed to Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, as well as European banks that may be negatively affected by adverse events in these countries. Further developments adversely affecting these countries or other similar developments in other Eurozone countries could have a material effect on the Swedbank Group's financial position, results of operations and business.
As of 31 December 2015 the Swedbank Group had total credit exposures of SEK 178 million to Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. It did not have any exposure to Greece. As a result of its exposure to these countries, the Swedbank Group's financial position, results of operations and business could deteriorate following further developments adversely affecting these countries or similar developments in other Eurozone countries.
The Swedbank Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's assets, including its loan portfolio, and its results of operations.
Currency risk arises mainly due to risks related to strategic holdings of foreign operations and when deposits and lending take place in different currencies. Exchange rate movements between SEK,

14

EUR and USD could have a significant adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's balance sheet position, as a substantial portion of the Swedbank Group's assets and liabilities are denominated in these currencies and, in the long-term, the Swedbank Group's income statement is in SEK. Changes in exchange rates affect both the balance sheet directly through strategic positions, and the Swedbank Group's income statement, as foreign currency cash flows from lending margins could affect net interest income. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies may also have a negative impact on the Swedbank Group's liquidity, since the Swedbank Group's overall liquidity includes balances which are held in foreign currencies. Additionally, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies may also have a negative impact on the Swedbank Group's capital position, since part of the Swedbank Group's capital and risk exposure amount is denominated in foreign currencies.
2.1.10 The Swedbank Group's business is sensitive to volatility in interest rates and to changes in the competitive environment affecting spreads on its lending and deposits.
The Swedbank Group is subject to the risks typical of banking activities, including interest rate fluctuations. Changes in interest rate levels, yield curves and spreads may affect the Swedbank Group's lending and deposit spreads. The Swedbank Group is exposed to changes in the spread between the interest rates payable by it on deposits or its wholesale funding costs, and the interest rates that it charges on loans to customers and other banks. While both the interest rates payable by the Swedbank Group on deposits, as well as the interest rates that it charges on loans to customers and credit institutions, are in each case mainly floating rates or swapped into floating rates, there is a risk that the Swedbank Group will not be able to re-price its floating rate assets and liabilities at the same time, giving rise to re-pricing gaps in the short or medium term. The Swedbank Group is also subject to intense competition for customer deposits and the current low interest rate environment puts pressure on the Swedbank Group's deposit spreads. The Swedbank Group may not be able to lower its funding costs, whether relating to deposits or wholesale funding, in line with decreases in interest rates on its interest-bearing assets.
Interest rates are sensitive to several factors that are out of the Swedbank Group's control, including fiscal and monetary policies of governments and central banks, as well as domestic and international political conditions. An increase in interest rates could reduce the demand for credit, as well as contribute to an increase in defaults by the Swedbank Group's customers. Conversely, a reduction in the level of interest rates may adversely affect the Swedbank Group through, among other things, a decrease in demand for deposits and an increase in competition in deposit-taking and lending to customers. As a result of these factors, significant changes or volatility in the interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Swedbank Group.
The Swedbank Group has implemented risk management methods aimed at mitigating these and other market risks, and exposures are constantly measured and monitored. While the Swedbank Group undertakes hedging operations in order to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk, it does not hedge all its risk exposure and cannot assure its hedging strategies will be successful. If the Swedbank Group is unable to adjust the interest rate payable on deposits in line with the changes in market interest rates receivable by it on loans, or if the Swedbank Group's monitoring procedures are unable to manage adequately the interest rate risk, its interest income could rise less or decline more than its interest expense, in which case the Swedbank Group's results of operations and financial condition or prospects could be negatively affected.
2.1.11 The Swedbank Group is subject to the risk that liquidity may not always be readily available.
The Swedbank Group's liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access debt markets, an inability to sell assets or redeem its investments, outflows of deposits or collateral deterioration. This situation may arise due to circumstances that the Swedbank Group is unable to control, such as continued general market disruption, loss in confidence in financial markets, uncertainty and speculation regarding the solvency of market participants, rating downgrades, or operational problems that affect
15

third parties. Even a perception among market participants that a financial institution is experiencing greater liquidity risk can cause significant damage to the institution and consequently its ability to access liquidity. Perceived liquidity risks from rumours or speculation in the market place can in certain circumstances lead to real liquidity impairments which can further lead to, amongst other things, a downgrade in credit ratings, thereby deepening a downward liquidity spiral. The Swedbank Group's ability to sell assets at a commercially desirable price or at all may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time or are not in the position to finance themselves, or when the market value of assets, including financial instruments underlying derivative transactions to which the Swedbank Group is a party, is difficult to ascertain, which occurred during the last liquidity crisis. In addition, financial institutions with which the Swedbank Group interacts may exercise set-off rights or the right to require additional collateral, which could further impair the Swedbank Group's access to liquidity.

The Swedbank Group's internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, the Swedbank Group may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favourable terms or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's business and results of operations.

2.1.12 The Swedbank Group's funding costs and its access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on its credit ratings.

Any downgrade of Swedbank's credit ratings, or the credit ratings of its significant subsidiaries such as Swedbank Mortgage, could increase its borrowing costs, adversely affect the liquidity position of the Swedbank Group, limit its access to the capital markets, undermine confidence in, and the competitive position of, the Swedbank Group, or trigger obligations under certain bilateral terms in some of its trading and collateralised financing contracts, including requiring the provision of additional collateral as well as limiting the range of counterparties willing to enter into transactions with the Swedbank Group. Any of the events above could have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's business and results of operations.

2.1.13 Substantially all of the Swedbank Group's retail mortgage portfolio comprises the cover pool for the covered bonds issued by Swedbank Mortgage.

As of 31 December 2015, substantially all of the Swedbank Group's Swedish retail mortgage portfolio was registered in the cover pool of Swedbank's wholly owned subsidiary, Swedbank Mortgage. The retail mortgages issued by Swedbank Mortgage comprise the cover pool and thereby serve as security for holders of the covered bonds issued by Swedbank Mortgage (and also counterparties under derivatives contracts entered into for hedging purposes in relation to such covered bonds). These mortgages do not form part of the general assets of Swedbank that would be available to holders of the Notes in the case of insolvency or liquidation of Swedbank. The Swedbank Group intends to cover a significant part of its long-term funding requirement through the additional issuance of covered bonds, which will be secured by future retail mortgages issued by Swedbank Mortgage. The Notes are unsecured obligations of Swedbank, and the Noteholders are structurally subordinated to the covered bondholders and hedge counterparties with respect to the covered bonds, to the extent of the cover pool, and are not likely to ever have access to the cover pool should Swedbank become insolvent or be liquidated.

2.1.14

The Swedbank Group is exposed to systemic risk and its business, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults by, entities who owe the Swedbank Group money, securities or other assets or whose securities or obligations the Swedbank Group holds.

Given the high level of interdependence between financial institutions, the Swedbank Group is, and will continue to be, subject to the risk of deterioration of the commercial and financial soundness, or perceived soundness, of other financial institutions. Within the financial services industry, the default

16

of any one institution could lead to defaults by other institutions. Concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, because the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely related as a result of their credit, trading, clearing or other relationships.

The Swedbank Group is exposed to the risk that entities owing the Swedbank Group money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These entities may default on their obligations to the Swedbank Group due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. The Swedbank Group is also subject to the risk that its rights against these entities may not be enforceable in all circumstances. For example, different methods of holding collateral in different countries can affect the Swedbank Group's exposures as well as the value of the collateral to the Swedbank Group. In addition, deterioration in the credit quality of securities or obligations held by the Swedbank Group could result in losses and/or adversely affect its ability to transfer or realise value from those securities or obligations in the event of liquidation. A significant downgrade in the credit ratings of the Swedbank Group's counterparties could also have a negative impact on the Swedbank Group's results. While in many cases the Swedbank Group is permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty or when collateral value decreases, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral the Swedbank Group is entitled to receive and the value of the counterparty's pledged assets. The termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may subject the Swedbank Group to claims for the improper exercise of its contractual rights. Bankruptcies, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral tend to increase in times of market stress and illiquidity. Rapid changes in prices on the financial markets may cause the Swedbank Group's exposure to such counterparties to increase, and in some of those cases the actual value of the Swedbank Group's collateral is lower than it was when the agreement was entered into. The Swedbank Group may not be able to retain the value of its collateral due to legal concerns and to the ability of the Swedbank Group to manage real estate property and other assets.

Even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of, or questions about, a counterparty may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by the Swedbank Group or by other institutions. This risk is sometimes referred to as "systemic risk" and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges with whom certain of the Swedbank Group's subsidiaries interact on a daily basis. Systemic risk could have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's ability to raise new funding and on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or prospects.

2.1.15

Swedbank or its financial institution subsidiaries may need additional capital in the future to maintain capital adequacy ratios or for other reasons, and it may be difficult to obtain such capital.

The Group, on a consolidated basis, and Swedbank and its financial institution subsidiaries, on an individual basis, are required to maintain minimum capital adequacy ratios and solvency levels prescribed by law in each of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. If the capital of the Group is not sufficient to cover future losses or if the applicable minimum capital requirements increase, the Group may need to obtain additional capital in the future and it may not be able to obtain new equity capital or debt financing qualifying as regulatory capital on attractive terms, or at all.

Moreover, developments in the regulatory framework such as changes in the risk weighting of assets may cause reductions in the Group's capital adequacy ratios and solvency levels and/or cause the applicable minimum capital requirements to increase.

Also, macro-prudential authorities may change the Group's capital requirements in the future, when they deem it necessary to contain systemic risk.

17

Capital and other requirements under the CRR
The Swedish capital adequacy framework is based on the CRR (the EU Capital Requirements Regulation ("CRR")) and the CRD IV (the EU Capital Requirements Directive ("CRD IV")), which implement in the EEA the framework for new capital and liquidity requirements intended to reinforce capital standards and to establish minimum liquidity standards for credit institutions (the so-called "Basel IN" framework) published by the Basel Committee in 2010.
Under the CRR and the European Commission's delegated act, Swedish banks are required to publicly disclose their leverage ratios. According to the Proposals (as defined under the heading "MREL/TLAC" below), the leverage ratio and a binding net stable funding ratio are to be introduced. The Proposals are subject to negotiation by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and are expected to enter into force no earlier than 2019 (or 2017 in the case of the proposal for a new asset class of "non-preferred" senior debt).
The Swedish FSA has imposed capital requirements beyond the minimum level of 7 per cent Common Equity Tier 1 capital (including the mandatory capital conservation buffer of 2.5 per cent) to Swedish banks, in accordance with the EU rules. The four major Swedish banks, including Swedbank, are required to maintain a systemic risk buffer of 3 per cent in Common Equity Tier 1 capital within the framework of Pillar 1 and a further 2 per cent within the framework of Pillar 2. The countercyclical buffer for Swedish exposures is 1.5 per cent as of 27 June 2016 and is applicable to Swedish exposures for all banks within Pillar 1 according to CRD IV. In March 2016, the Swedish FSA decided to increase the countercyclical buffer rate for Swedish exposures to 2.0 per cent, effective as of 19 March 2017.
Since the CRR became law, the Swedish FSA has had the authority to grant banks exemptions from the current Basel I floor. The Swedish FSA however has decided that the Basel I floor is to be applied in Sweden. The buffer requirements in CRR/CRD IV, including the systemic risk buffers for the systemically important Swedish banks, are calculated without taking the Basel I floor into account. The floor is a parallel back-stop rule to define the lowest allowed level of own funds.
Supervisory authorities in Sweden and at the international level have made note of the major differences among the average risk weights generated by banks' internal models for credit risk under the internal rating-based ("IRB") approach (an approach for calculating capital requirements for credit risk), especially as regards mortgage lending within the retail exposure class. In 2013, the Swedish FSA introduced a risk weight floor for the Swedish mortgages as a supervisory measure under Pillar 2. The risk weight floor for Swedish mortgages was raised in 2014 from 15 to 25 per cent.
During 2015, the Swedish FSA clarified its view on the capital requirements for Pillar 2 risks. In September 2015 the Swedish FSA completed its supervisory review and evaluation process ("SREP") for 2015 for Swedbank. In the course of the SREP, the Swedish FSA used the standardised methods it presented in May 2015, which provided for assessing capital requirements within the framework of Pillar 2 for credit-related concentration risk, interest rate risk in the banking book, and pension risk.
The Swedish FSA has previously stated that it does not intend to make formal decisions on the capital requirement for individual institutions in Pillar 2. As long as a formal decision has not been made, the capital requirement under Pillar 2 does not affect the level at which automatic restrictions on dividend and coupon payments on certain subordinated securities (including the Notes) take effect (due to a breach of the combined buffer requirements). In January 2016, the Swedish FSA reiterated its view in a response to a document issued by the EBA on this topic.
At present, Swedbank has sufficient CET 1 capital to meet its capital requirements. However, no assurances can be made that Swedbank will continue to hold this level of CET 1 capital, that the regulations around the capital requirements will not change in the future, or that the definition of what
18

constitutes CET 1 capital will not change in the future. For example, the 2016 Proposals discussed below contain proposals to amend the current Pillar 2 requirements.
BRRD
The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive 2014/59/EU ("BRRD") was recently implemented by Sweden through the Swedish Resolution Act (the "Resolution Act"). Swedbank operates under the BRRD. The Resolution Act is likely to impact the size of the capital buffer needed by a bank, in addition to those set out in the CRR and the CRD IV.
To ensure that banks always have sufficient loss-absorbing capacity, the Resolution Act provides for the Swedish resolution authority to set minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities ("MREL") for each institution, based on, amongst other criteria, its size, risk and business model.
MREL/TLAC
The Financial Stability Board has issued a standard on Total Loss-absorbing Capacity ("TLAC"), which sets corresponding requirements for global systemically important banks. Swedbank is not a global systemically important bank. The TLAC requirement will be phased in starting from 1 January 2019. However, there is currently work going on in the EU to implement the TLAC standard in EU legislation. In particular, the European Commission has proposed to incorporate TLAC into the capital requirements framework, as an extension to the own funds requirements and as part of the Proposals discussed below. Although TLAC only applies to global systemically important banks, in the Proposals the European Commission has proposed that other banks in a member state, like Swedbank, be subject to a firm-specific MREL regime under which they be required to issue a sufficient amount of eligible instruments to absorb expected losses in resolution and to recapitalise the institution or surviving the part thereof.
On 26 April 2016, the Swedish Resolution authority, Swedish National Debt Office ("SNDO") published a proposal detailing its plans for implementing the MREL requirement on Swedish banks. The MREL requirement for systemically important banks in Sweden, such as Swedbank, would be the sum of a loss absorption amount plus a recapitalisation amount. The loss absorption amount equals the current total capital requirement excluding the combined buffer requirement and the Pillar 2 systemic risk surcharge. The recapitalisation amount equals the total current capital requirement (i.e. including combined buffer and Pillar 2 requirements). The loss absorption amount can be met with own funds instruments (Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2), while the recapitalisation amount can only be met with eligible liabilities (essentially senior unsecured bonds or term deposits from large corporates, having a remaining maturity of at least one year). The SNDO will make the actual first decisions for the Swedish banks' MREL requirements in autumn 2016, and Swedish banks have to comply with the MREL requirements starting from 2018.
Moreover, the SNDO's view is that a requirement that MREL eligible liabilities shall be subordinated to senior liabilities should be introduced eventually. However, since a requirement on subordination would have major consequences for Swedish banks, the SNDO is going to investigate further how and when such a requirement can be introduced. Subordination requirements are also addressed in the Proposals and the outcome of the Proposals will therefore also be relevant in this regard. The SNDO expects to revert at the earliest in the first quarter of 2017 regarding the details of a subordination requirement.
Swedbank's best understanding and estimates of the SNDO's implementation of MREL shows that Swedbank on a consolidated level already has enough capital and eligible liabilities if the expected initial MREL requirements (excluding any requirements of subordination) would be introduced today. However, due to the potential amendment of the requirement in the future, including as a result of the Proposals, there are still uncertainties regarding the final configuration and level of the MREL requirement, and consequently how this will affect Swedbank's capital requirements.

On 23 November 2016, the European Commission published legislative proposals for amendments to the CRR, the CRD IV, the BRRD and the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation and proposed an amending directive to facilitate the creation of a new asset class of "non-preferred" senior debt (the "Proposals"). The Proposals cover multiple areas, including the Pillar 2 framework, the leverage ratio, mandatory restrictions on distributions, permission for reducing own funds and eligible liabilities, macroprudential tools, a new category of "non-preferred" senior debt, the MREL framework and the integration of the TLAC standard into EU legislation as mentioned above. The Proposals are to be considered by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and therefore remain subject to change. The final package of new legislation may not include all elements of the Proposals and new or amended elements may be introduced through the course of the legislative process. Until the Proposals are in final form, it is uncertain how the Proposals will affect Swedbank or holders of the Notes.
The Basel Committee
The Basel Committee is working on several policy and supervisory measures that aim to enhance the reliability and comparability of risk-weighted capital ratios. The measures include revised standardised approaches for credit risk and for operational risk, a set of constraints on the use of internal model approaches for credit risk, including exposure-level, model-parameter floors, a leverage ratio minimum requirement, and aggregate capital floors for banks that use internal models based on the proposed revised standardised approaches.
In particular, in December 2015 the Basel Committee published its second consultative document on a revised standardised approach for credit risk. The document proposes, among other things, reducing reliance on external credit ratings, increasing risk sensitivity, and reducing national discretions.
In 2014 the Basel Committee issued a final regulatory text for a new standardised approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures, which is included in the Proposals. Moreover, in January 2016 the Basel Committee completed the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, a comprehensive revision of the capital adequacy standard for market risk, which is also included in the Proposals. The new standard entails for substantial revisions to both the standardised approach and the internal models approach. Furthermore, in March 2016, the Basel Committee published a proposal for a new standardised measurement approach for operational risk, which would replace all existing approaches for operational risks, including the Advanced Measurement Approach, which is the internal model-based approach for measuring operational risk in the current framework.
In December 2014 the Basel Committee issued a consultative document on the design of a capital floor framework. The framework would be based on the proposed revised standardised approaches, to limit the risk that capital requirements are too low due to the use of internal models. The new floor framework would replace the current capital floor, based on the Basel I standard, for banks using internal models.
In March 2016, the Basel Committee proposed constraints on the use of internal model approaches for credit risk. In particular, the Basel Committee proposed to remove the option of using the IRB approaches for certain exposures; to adopt exposure-level, model-parameter floors; and to provide greater specification of parameter estimation practices.
The Basel Committee plans to finalise all those revisions to the Basel III framework, including the calibration of the aggregate capital floors framework and the leverage ratio minimum requirement, at or around the end of 2016.
There is a high degree of uncertainty with regards to the Basel Committee's final calibration of the proposed reforms, and subsequently how and when they will be implemented in the EU. It is thus too early to draw firm conclusions regarding the impact on the future capital requirements.
20

Swedish capital requirements
In May 2016 the Swedish FSA adopted revised requirements for Swedish banks calculating risk weights for capital requirements using the internal ratings-based approach, especially with regard to corporate exposures. The Swedish FSA began applying the revisions in its Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) for 2016, which the Swedish FSA finalised at the end of September 2016. Therefore, the revisions affect Swedbank's capital requirements beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. The revisions require banks to anticipate a larger proportion of economic downturn in their estimates of probability of default, which increased Swedbank's CET 1 capital requirement by 0.5 per cent., and to use a so-called maturity floor, which has increased Swedbank's CET1 capital requirement by 0.2 per cent.
Accounting standards
In 2013, International Accounting Standard ("IAS") 19, the revised accounting standard for pensions, took effect. According to IAS 19, the valuation of the pension provision for the Swedbank Group's defined benefit pension schemes should be based on actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations are based on a number of assumptions that are highly susceptible to change from period to period, thus creating volatility in the estimated pension liabilities. That, in turn, creates volatility in the CET1 capital.
As a consequence of the proposed changes in the regulatory framework and uncertainty relating to their implementation, including the Proposals, as discussed under each sub-heading above, the Swedbank Group may need to obtain additional capital in the future, and may not be able to obtain new equity capital or debt financing qualifying as regulatory capital on attractive terms, or at all. Therefore, the Swedbank Group may need to sell assets and these sales may be at distressed prices, to the extent that a market exists, which may have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
In addition, if the capital ratios of Swedbank's financial institution subsidiaries deteriorate, Swedbank, as the parent company, may be required to provide funding by way of direct or indirect capital contributions, loans, or guarantees of loans, into its subsidiaries. To the extent that it does not, Swedbank Group operations may be restricted in these jurisdictions as a result of regulatory penalties.
2.1.16 The Group may see a downgrade of parts of the credit portfolio, resulting in a negative migration in the risk classification system
The Group may see a downgrade of parts of the credit portfolio, resulting in a negative migration in the risk classification system. The Group uses through-the-cycle estimates of PD for the purpose of calculating the regulatory capital requirement, but there is still a risk that such migration could result in a higher regulatory capital requirement, which may lead to a need to obtain additional capital. In addition, the Group values assets and assesses the capital adequacy position of its banking subsidiaries using financial models based on assumptions and estimates taking into account the then prevailing market conditions which may prove inadequate if market conditions deteriorate. Furthermore, changes in foreign exchange rates, decreases in collateral ratios as a consequence of the deterioration of the market value of assets pledged as collateral, or deterioration in the economic environment, among other things, could result in further provisioning and/or an increase in Risk Exposure Amount ("REA"), which could have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
2.1.17 Governmental responses to market disruptions may be inadequate and may have unintended consequences.
21

The Swedbank Group may be adversely affected by governmental responses to market disruptions in the countries in which it operates. As a result of the financial crisis in 2008 and subsequent government intervention, there has been, and there will continue to be, a substantial increase in governmental policy responses to market disruptions, including reductions in public spending and the imposition of further fiscal austerity measures, and changes in monetary and interest rate policies.

The Swedbank Group has no control over governmental policy changes or over changes in the interpretation of fiscal legislation by any tax authority. The recent measures taken by various European governments to stimulate the economy and support the banking system may lead to an increase in the tax burden or to a reduction in tax benefits. Significant changes in governmental policy responses in Sweden or in the other countries where the Swedbank Group operates, or difficulties in implementing such responses or with the type and effectiveness of the impact of such responses, may have a relevant adverse impact on the activity, financial situation and operating results of the Swedbank Group. For instance, the Swedbank Group may have to enter into future contractual arrangements by operation of law or necessity under which the Swedish Government may have the right to take possession over the Swedbank Group or part of it or its assets. In such instance of government takeover, the value of the Swedbank Group or its assets may be considered to be limited and the Swedbank Group may not receive adequate compensation, which could therefore significantly reduce its assets.

2.1.18

The Swedbank Group may be required to reassess assumptions used in the calculation of defined benefit pension schemes and to make further contributions to its pension schemes if the value of the plan assets is not sufficient to cover potential liabilities.

The Swedbank Group maintains a number of defined benefit pension schemes and pension schemes based on the salaries of employees at the time of retirement for former and current employees, primarily in Sweden. Pension risk is the risk that the liabilities of the Swedbank Group's various defined benefit pension schemes, which are long-term in nature, will be higher than the liabilities projected based on current assumptions. Major assumptions include those pertaining to salary increases, mortality, discount rates and inflation. Risk also arises from the plan assets because the value of these asset portfolios and the returns from them may be less than expected, especially if equity prices, interest rates, counterparty risk (including sovereigns) or inflation are subject to significant changes. Actual outcome might also differ from current assumptions. These changes or differences, as expressed by an actuarial loss, could be significant and could have a negative impact on the Swedbank Group's results of operations. The Swedbank Group makes contributions to the schemes so that the plan assets cover obligations according to Swedish legal requirements. If a deficit arises the Swedbank Group could be obliged to, or may choose to, make additional contributions to the schemes. Swedbank's reported pension liability decreased by approximately SEK 1.3 billion and became a pension asset at the end of 2015 and shareholders' equity increased by approximately SEK 2.8 billion in 2015 due to re-measurements. Consequently, CET 1 capital increased, but only by approximately SEK 1.8 billion. The pension asset of SEK 1.3 billion, SEK 1.0 billion after tax, is not permitted to be included in CET 1 capital. During 2015, the discount rate in Sweden increased from 2.29 per cent to 3.53 per cent, which was counteracted to some extent by an increase in the inflation rate from 1.28 per cent to 1.63 per cent in 2015. The rules in IAS 19 as discussed in 2.1.15, regarding defined benefit pension plans could create volatility in the estimated pension liability and thus to Swedbank's equity through other comprehensive income.

2.1.19

Market fluctuations and volatility may adversely affect the value of the Swedbank Group's positions, reduce its business activities and make it more difficult to assess the fair value of certain of its assets.

The fair value of certain of the Swedbank Group's assets may decline significantly due to dislocation of financial markets, causing the Swedbank Group to record mark-to-market losses and may fluctuate over short periods of time. In addition, the Swedbank Group's estimates of fair value may differ materially both from similar estimates made by other financial institutions and from the values that

22

would have been used if a market for these assets had been readily available. Market fluctuations, in particular, fluctuations in the equity market, also influence the value of assets in funds managed by the Swedbank Group's asset management business and have a direct impact on the income volatility of the asset management activities. Furthermore, similar to any other holding company with insurance subsidiaries, the Swedbank Group's level of fees and returns from its equity investments in these subsidiaries are impacted by any decrease in the value of their investment portfolios, poor investment returns and the requirement to maintain assets sufficient to cover mandatory provisions for insurance claims.

The fair value of interest bearing securities trading in active markets is ordinarily based on market prices (mark-to-market). However, where quoted prices on instruments are not readily and regularly available, as was the case in particular during autumn 2008, due in part to the dislocation of the global financial markets, fair value is estimated using an internal valuation model (mark-to-model), which is generally based on observable market data, meaning the prices of financial instruments that are as similar in nature as possible and for which transactions have been completed. These values are then adjusted to best reflect the value of the Swedbank Group's securities. Adjustments for the relevant credit risk are based on the derivatives market.

2.1.20

The IT and other systems on which the Swedbank Group depends for its day-to-day operations can fail for a variety of reasons which may be outside the Swedbank Group's control; the Swedbank Group is subject to the risk of infrastructure disruptions or other effects on such systems.

The Swedbank Group's operations are highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies, as well as its ability to accommodate current and future regulatory provisions, such as anti-money laundering monitoring requirements and IFRS 9 record keeping and calculations.

Any disruption in the Swedbank Group's IT or other systems may have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's financial condition and results of operations.

Despite the contingency plans and facilities the Swedbank Group has in place, its ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports the businesses and the countries in which the Swedbank Group is located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by the Swedbank Group or third parties with whom it conducts business, or a catastrophic event involving any location where the Swedbank Group has a significant operational base.

Problems encountered with respect to internet reliability may be substantial impediments to internet banking and may result in a less stable IT operational base, which may in turn have an adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's business and results of operations.

2.1.21 The Swedbank Group's activities may be subject to the risk of cybercrime attacks

As for all major financial institutions, Swedbank's activities have been, and will continue to be, subject to an increasing risk of cyber-attacks, the nature of which is continually evolving. Cybercrime attempts are primarily related to the Swedbank Group's internet bank users and include physical identity theft, unauthorised access to privileged and sensitive customer information, including internet bank credentials as well as payment and credit card information. The Swedbank Group has also experienced a large number of denial of service (DDoS) attempts against Swedbank's infrastructure, causing minor impact except for two attempts in October and November 2015 which caused the Swedbank Group's external website to be unavailable for a period of time. The Swedbank Group also expects to face requirements going forward in relation to regulations related to cybersecurity, such as

23

the new EU General Data Protection Regulation or the EBA's upcoming regulation on strong customer authentication.

The Swedbank Group has continued to invest in building systems and defences to address threats from cyber-attacks. However, the Swedbank Group may continue to experience security breaches or unexpected disruptions to its systems and services in the future. Such security breaches and unexpected disruptions may in turn result in liability to its customers and third parties and have an adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's business, reputation and results of operations.

2.1.22 Litigation arising from the Swedbank Group's business conduct may have an adverse impact on its performance and position.

Entities within the Swedbank Group may be involved from time to time in legal proceedings arising from the conduct of their business. The reputational and aggregate potential liability in respect thereof cannot be accurately assessed. Any material legal proceedings, or publicity surrounding such legal or regulatory proceedings, may adversely impact the Swedbank Group's business, reputation and results of operations. For additional information, please see "General Information".

2.1.23

The Swedbank Group is exposed to risks related to money laundering activities, especially in its operations in emerging markets, and compliance with anti-money laundering and anti terrorism financing rules involves significant cost and effort.

The Swedbank Group is subject to rules and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In general, the risk that banks will be subjected to or used for money laundering has increased worldwide. The risk of money laundering is higher in emerging markets, such as the Baltic countries, than in Sweden and other more developed markets where the Swedbank Group operates. The high turnover of employees, the difficulty in consistently implementing related policies and technology systems, and the general business conditions in emerging markets mean that the risk of the occurrence of money laundering is higher in these countries. The Swedbank Group requires any violations to be reported in its regular compliance report. In addition, suspicious activity reports are filed with the local Financial Intelligence Unit by the Swedbank Group's Money Laundering Reporting Officer according to local procedures. Although the Swedbank Group believes that its current policies and procedures are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations, it cannot guarantee that its Group-wide anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing policies and procedures completely prevent instances of money laundering or terrorism financing. Any violation of anti-money laundering rules, or even the suggestion of violations, may have severe legal and reputational consequences for the Swedbank Group and may, as a result, have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's financial condition and results of operations.

2.1.24 Conflicts of interest, whether actual or perceived, and non-compliance or fraudulent acts may negatively impact the Swedbank Group.

As the Swedbank Group expands the scope of its businesses and its client base, the Swedbank Group increasingly has to implement policies on corporate governance on a Group-wide level and address potential conflicts of interest and compliance with applicable laws. However, appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex, in part because internal breaches of policy can be difficult to discover.

The Swedbank Group's reputation could be damaged as a result and there may be a reluctance on the part of clients to enter transactions where there is the possibility of a conflict, or if the Swedbank Group is seen to fail to identify, or deal appropriately with, conflicts of interest. In the autumn of 2015, there was media coverage of certain transactions by some of Swedbank's senior executives which were perceived as raising conflicts of interest issues. In December 2015, Swedbank was notified by the Swedish FSA that they were conducting an investigation into those transactions to see how Swedbank has managed any conflicts of interest. In January 2016 Swedbank provided the Swedish

24

FSA with the requested information and in April 2016 the Swedish FSA requested additional information on the matter. There could be a risk of reputational harm to the Swedbank Group as a result of this investigation.
2.1.25 Actions or inactions of savings banks which are parties to co-operation agreements with the Swedbank Group may have a negative impact on the Swedbank Group.
In the normal course of business, the Swedbank Group enters into various commercial agreements with companies related to the banking industry. The Swedbank Group has co-operation agreements with associated independent savings banks and partly-owned banks pursuant to which the co operating banks market and distribute a range of the Swedbank Group's products and services through their own local branch networks. If the reputation or financial condition of one or more of the co-operating banks, through action or inaction, were to be adversely affected while operating under the Swedbank Group's trademark, the Swedbank Group's reputation could also be adversely affected regardless of whether the Swedbank Group contributed to the action or inaction causing such reputational or financial injury, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.
2.1.26 The Swedbank Group operates in competitive markets and further increased competition may have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.
The Swedbank Group is subject to significant competition in the markets in which it operates. Competition may increase in some or all of the Swedbank Group's markets as a result of legislative, regulatory, technological or other factors. Increased competition could cause the Swedbank Group to lose business or compel it to price products and services on less advantageous terms, or otherwise have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, increased competitor participation in the financial sector generally in the Swedbank Group's principal markets may have an impact on the competitive landscape in such markets and on the way in which banks in those markets conduct their operations. At present, however, it is difficult to predict what the effects of this increased competitor participation will be or how it will differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, should it materialise. The Swedbank Group may experience stronger competition and greater pressure on profit margins. These and other changes in the competitive landscape could adversely affect the Swedbank Group's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, markets and/or prospects.
2.1.27 In order to successfully compete, the Swedbank Group depends on highly skilled individuals; the Swedbank Group may not be able to retain or recruit key talent.
The Swedbank Group's performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. The Swedbank Group's continued ability to compete effectively in its businesses depends on the Swedbank Group's ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate its existing employees. Competition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry for qualified employees is intense. In addition, current and future laws, including laws relating to immigration and outsourcing, and remuneration restrictions under CRD IV, may restrict the Swedbank Group's ability to move responsibilities or personnel from one jurisdiction to another or to offer competitive compensation to attract new employees and to retain and motivate its existing employees. The need for higher cost efficiency will also result in a lower rate of wage increases in coming years, which may also impact the Swedbank Group's ability to retain or recruit employees. This may impact the Swedbank Group's ability to take advantage of business opportunities, potential efficiencies, or profitably manage its existing or new assets.
Swedbank has recently experienced changes within the Swedbank Group, and the level of employee engagement has declined, which may result in increased employee turnover. Employee competence and dedication to customer service impacts Swedbank's customers' experience and contributes to customer value. Employees have a high workload and the Swedbank Group requires complex
25

planning of resources, with a need to prioritise both business-driven development and regulatorydriven development while simultaneously managing day-to-day operations. Increased staff-related risks could materially adversely affect the Swedbank Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.
2.1.28 The Swedbank Group's business is subject to substantial regulation and supervision and can be adversely affected by adverse regulatory and governmental developments.
The Swedbank Group conducts its businesses subject to ongoing regulation and associated regulatory risks, including the effects of changes in the laws, regulations, policies, voluntary codes of practice and interpretations in Sweden and the other countries in which the Swedbank Group operates. This is particularly the case in the current market environment, which is experiencing increased levels of government and regulatory intervention in the financial sector, which the Swedbank Group expects to continue for the foreseeable future. Future changes in regulation, fiscal or other policies are unpredictable and beyond the control of the Swedbank Group and could materially adversely affect the Swedbank Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Swedbank Group's operations are contingent upon licences issued by financial authorities in the countries in which the Swedbank Group operates. Violations of rules and regulations, whether intentional or unintentional, may lead to the withdrawal of some of the Swedbank Group's licences. Any breach of these or other regulations may adversely affect the Swedbank Group's reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition.
Swedbank is subject to supervision by the Swedish FSA and to Swedish regulations regarding, among other things, capital adequacy, liquidity and solvency (see "Risk Factors - Risks Relating to the Swedbank Group - Swedbank or its financial institution subsidiaries may need additional capital in the future to maintain capital adequacy ratios or for other reasons, and it may be difficult to obtain such capital"). Certain of the Swedbank Group's subsidiaries and operations are subject to the supervision of other local supervisory authorities. In Sweden and elsewhere, there is increased political and regulatory scrutiny of financial and mortgage institutions. Increased regulatory intervention may lead to requests from regulators to carry out wide-ranging reviews of past sales and/or sales practices. The Swedbank Group is unable to predict what regulatory changes may be imposed in the future as a result of regulatory initiatives in the EU and elsewhere or by the Swedish FSA and other supervisory authorities. If the Swedbank Group is required to make additional provisions or to increase its reserves as a result of potential regulatory changes, this could adversely affect the results of operations of the Swedbank Group. In addition, failure by the Swedbank Group to comply with regulatory requirements could result in significant penalties.
In the United States, passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") has led to significant regulatory reforms affecting the financial services industry, including non-U.S. banks. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act addresses systemic risk oversight, bank capital standards, the orderly liquidation of failing systemically significant financial institutions, over-the-counter derivatives, and the ability of banks and their affiliates to engage as principal in proprietary trading activities and sponsor and invest in certain private funds (the so-called "Volcker Rule"). The Dodd-Frank Act and other post-financial crisis regulatory reforms in the United States have increased costs, imposed limitations on activities, and resulted in an increased intensity in regulatory enforcement. Many of the rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalised or proposed, but significant uncertainty remains on the overall impact (including extraterritorial impacts) that the Dodd-Frank Act could have on the Issuer or the financial services industry as a whole.
In particular, in December 2013, the U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") and four other U.S. federal regulatory agencies issued final regulations implementing the Volcker Rule, which restricts banking entities (including the Issuer and all of its global affiliates) from engaging, as principal, in proprietary trading and from sponsoring or holding
26

ownership interests in or having certain relationships with hedge, private equity or other similar funds ("covered funds"), subject to certain exceptions and exclusions. The conformance period for the Volcker Rule ended on 21 July 2015, although the Federal Reserve extended the conformance period to 21 July 2017 for investments in and relationships with covered funds that were in place prior to 31 December 2013. Financial institutions subject to the rule, such as Swedbank, must bring their activities and investments into compliance, and must implement a specific compliance programme. Further implementation efforts may be necessary based on subsequent regulatory interpretations, guidelines or examinations. The failure of the Swedbank Group to effectively manage regulatory risks could have a material adverse effect on the Swedbank Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.
2.1.29 The full scope and consequences of new derivatives regulations are yet unknown and may impose additional regulatory burdens and costs that may affect the value of the Notes
The European Market Infrastructure Regulation 648/2012 ("EMIR") entered into force in all member states of the EU, including Sweden, on 16 August 2012. EMIR aims to increase stability in European over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives markets and includes measures to require the clearing of certain OTC derivatives contracts through central clearing counterparties and to increase the transparency of OTC derivatives transactions. EMIR applies to OTC derivatives contracts falling within its scope entered into by financial counterparties such as Swedbank, regardless of the identity of the other counterparty to the contract. In connection with EMIR, various regulatory and implementing technical standards have now come into force, but certain critical technical standards remain outstanding, such as the regulatory technical standards on margin requirements for uncleared derivatives, which are yet to be finalised. Similarly, although regulatory technical standards subjecting certain classes of OTC derivatives to the clearing obligation have already been published, it is possible that the European Securities and Markets Authority ("ESMA") may publish further regulatory technical standards subjecting additional classes of OTC derivatives to the clearing obligation. Prospective investors should be aware that any regulatory changes arising from EMIR may in due course significantly increase the cost for Swedbank of entering into or taking any other action in relation to derivative contracts and may adversely affect their ability to engage in derivative contracts.
In addition, Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act ("Title VII"), as well as other post-financial crisis regulatory reforms in the U.S., have increased costs, imposed limitations on activities and resulted in an increased intensity in regulatory enforcement. Title VII established a comprehensive U.S. regulatory regime for derivatives contracts, including swaps, security-based swaps and mixed swaps. Among other things, Title VII provides the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and the SEC with jurisdiction and regulatory authority over swaps, security-based swaps and mixed swaps, requires the establishment of a comprehensive registration and regulatory framework applicable to swap dealers and security-based swap dealers and other major market participants, requires the reporting of swap and security-based swap data, requires certain swaps and will require certain security-based swaps to be exchange-traded or executed on a swap execution facility or securitybased swap execution facility, as applicable, and centrally cleared, and will impose capital requirements and margin requirements for uncleared swap and security-based swap transactions.
Many of the key regulations implementing Title VII have recently become effective or are in final form. However, in some instances, the interpretation and potential impact of these regulations are not yet entirely clear. Additionally, the requirements for security-based swaps more generally, are not yet in effect. Due to this uncertainty, a complete assessment of the effects of Title VII and certain other post financial crisis regulatory reforms in the U.S. cannot be made at this time. Swedbank regularly deals and transacts in derivatives. As a result, it may be required to register with the CFTC and/or the SEC. In addition, Swedbank enters into swaps and security-based swaps, and certain swaps may be subject to the clearing, capital, margin, business conduct, reporting and/or recordkeeping requirements of Title VII or other related regulatory reforms, that will result in additional regulatory burdens and related costs and expenses.
27

The above could potentially adversely affect the Issuer's earnings and the need to comply with new regulations may detrimentally affect the Swedbank Group's business by increasing costs and limiting the volume and type of liquid assets the Swedbank Group can invest in. Swedbank is currently considering the impact of EMIR and Title VII on its business and monitoring the regulatory developments. Although many key regulations implementing EMIR and Title VII have been finalised, some are not yet effective or have otherwise been delayed, or may be subject to further interpretations or modifications, and as such, a full assessment of the exact effects cannot be made at this time.

2.2

Risks relating to the Notes

2.2.1 Risks relating to the structure of the Notes

2.2.1.1 Interestpayments on the Notes may be cancelled by the Issuer (in whole or in part) at any time and, in certain circumstances, the Issuer will be required to cancel such interestpayments

2.2.1.1.1 The Issuer is entitled to cancel interest payments for no reason and without stating a reason or giving notice to Noteholders

Interest on the Notes will be due and payable only at the sole and absolute discretion of the Issuer, which may, at all times and for any reason, cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment that would otherwise be payable on any Interest Payment Date.

The Issuer may without restriction use funds that could have been applied to make such cancelled payments to meet its other obligations as they become due and may pay interest on other subordinated debt and dividends on its shares notwithstanding such cancellation.

2.2.1.1.2 In certain circumstances the Issuer may be required by law or banking regulations or contractual obligations to cancel interest payments in whole or in part

In certain circumstances the Issuer may be required by law or banking regulations or contractual obligations to cancel interest payments. These regulations and their interaction are complex and may change over time.

Under the regulations in force at the time of issuance, the Issuer is only allowed to pay interest (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Additional Amounts) out of "distributable items" (as defined in CRR). In practice this means that the Issuer will be required to cancel an interest payment in whole or in part, if its distributable items on an Interest Payment Date are less than the sum of all distributions or interest payments on all own funds instruments of the Issuer paid or required to be paid in the then financial year.

Further, under Article 141 (Restrictions on distributions) of the CRD IV Directive, as recently implemented in Sweden, institutions that fail to meet the combined buffer requirement (as described below) will be subject to restricted "discretionary payments" (which are defined broadly by CRD IV as payments relating to common equity Tier 1, variable remuneration and payments on Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments). In these circumstances, payments will be made on the Notes (whether by way of principal, interest or otherwise) only if and to the extent that such payments would not cause the maximum distributable amount (if any) to be exceeded. The determination of the maximum distributable amount is particularly complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty.

For example, the maximum distributable amount could be limited to earnings accrued from the time of the latest decision to make a "discretionary payment". The probability of the Issuer paying interest on the Notes in this situation would therefore, in addition to other circumstances, depend on the timing of the Issuer's other discretionary payment decisions, such as any decision to pay dividends to the shareholders of the Issuer. There is no legal obligation on the Issuer in this situation to prioritise payments to holders of the Notes before payments to its shareholders.

Under CRD IV, institutions will be required to hold a minimum amount of regulatory capital of 8.0 per cent. of Risk Exposure Amount (as defined in CRR). In addition to these so-called "own funds" requirements under CRD IV, supervisors may require that extra capital be added to cover other risks (thereby increasing the regulatory minimum required under CRD IV). In Sweden, it is anticipated that the Swedish FSA will do this by continuous dialogue with institutions rather than formal additional capital requirements. In any event, the views of the Swedish FSA will affect the level at which restrictions on distributions linked to the "combined buffer requirement" come into effect.
CRD IV also introduces capital buffer requirements that are in addition to the minimum capital requirement and required to be met with common equity tier 1 capital. It introduces five new capital buffers: (i) the capital conservation buffer, (ii) the institution-specific counter-cyclical buffer, (iii) the global systemically important institutions buffer, (iv) the other systemically important institutions buffer and (v) the systemic risk buffer. Some or all of these buffers may be applicable to the Swedbank Group as determined by the Swedish FSA in accordance with Swedish legislation implementing CRD IV in Sweden and are referred to as the "combined buffer requirements". Under the Proposals, an institution (such as Swedbank) will be deemed to fail to meet its combined buffer requirement, and therefore to subject to the restrictions on payments on instruments, such as the Notes, where it does not have own funds and eligible liabilities in an amount and quality to meet all of the following:
╖ its combined buffer requirement;
╖ its 4.5 per cent. Pillar 1 requirement and its Pillar 2 CET1 requirement;
╖ its 6 per cent. Pillar 1 requirement and its Pillar 2 Tier 1 requirement;
╖ its 8 per cent. Pillar 1 requirement and its Pillar 2 total capital requirement; and
╖ its MREL/TLAC requirement (subject to a potential six month grace period).
See the risk factor entitled "Swedbank or its financial institution subsidiaries may need additional capital in the future to maintain capital adequacy ratios or for other reasons, and it may be difficult to obtain such capital' for a further discussion in respect of the Proposals.
In addition to the regulatory restrictions mentioned above, the Issuer is bound by certain contractual obligations affecting its discretion to pay interest on the Notes. Under the conditions of certain Parity Securities issued prior to the issuance of the Notes, if the "available distributable amount" (as defined therein) is not sufficient to make all interest payments in full on those Parity Securities and all other debt instruments ranking pari passu with them, including the Notes, interest payments on all of these will be reduced.
Any interest cancelled pursuant to the Terms and Conditions of the Notes shall not be due and shall not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter, and Noteholders shall have no rights thereto or to receive any additional interest or compensation as a result of such cancellation. Furthermore, no cancellation of interest in accordance with the terms of the Notes shall constitute a default in payment or otherwise under the Notes.
The Issuer is not obliged to inform investors about such interest cancellation, neither before or after it has occurred.
2.2.1.1.3 The Notes may be traded with accrued interest, but under certain circumstances described above such interest may be cancelled and not paid on the relevant Interest Payment Date
The Notes may trade, and/or the prices for the Notes may appear, on the Irish Stock Exchange and in other trading systems with accrued interest. If this occurs, purchasers of the Notes in the secondary market will pay a price that reflects such accrued interest upon purchase of the Notes. However, if a payment of interest on any Interest Payment Date is cancelled (in whole or in part) as described
29

herein and thus is not due and payable, purchasers of such Notes will not be entitled to that interest payment (or, if the Issuer elects to make a payment of a portion, but not all, of such interest payment, the portion of such interest payment not paid) on the relevant Interest Payment Date.
2.2.1.1.4 Any actual or anticipated cancellation of interest on the Notes will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes
Any actual or anticipated cancellation of interest on the Notes will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. In addition, as a result of the interest cancellation provisions of the Notes, the market price of the Notes may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities on which interest accrues that are not subject to such cancellation and may be more sensitive generally to adverse changes in the Swedbank Group's financial condition.
2.2.1.2 Upon the occurrence o f a Trigger Event, the Noteholders will lose all o f their claims for payment under the Notes and receive Conversion Shares instead which are m ore deeply subordinated than the Notes
Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event, the Noteholders will lose all of their claims for payment under the Notes and receive Conversion Shares instead which are more deeply subordinated than the Notes. The number and/or value of the Conversion Shares received by Noteholders following an Automatic Conversion may be less than Noteholders may have expected. In addition, Noteholders may not receive Conversion Shares if they fail to submit a Delivery Notice in the manner or within the prescribed period set out in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes
The Notes are being issued for capital adequacy regulatory purposes with the intention and purpose of being eligible as Additional Tier 1 Capital of the Issuer and the Swedbank Group. Such eligibility depends upon a number of conditions being satisfied, which are reflected in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes. One of these relates to the ability of the Notes and the proceeds of their issue to be available to absorb any losses of the Issuer. Accordingly, upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event, (i) the Notes will be converted into Conversion Shares, (ii) the principal amount of the Notes will be written down to zero and, accordingly, the principal amount of the Notes shall equal zero at all times thereafter, (iii) the Noteholders will no longer have any rights against the Issuer with respect to the repayment of the principal amount of the Notes or the payment of interest or any other amount on or in respect of such Notes, which liabilities of the Issuer shall be irrevocably and automatically released and (iv) the Issuer's only obligations and liabilities under the Notes shall be an obligation to deliver Conversion Shares to the Settlement Shares Depositary on behalf of the Noteholders.
Once a Note has been converted into Conversion Shares, the principal amount of such Note will not be restored in any circumstances (including where the relevant Trigger Event ceases to continue), no further interest will accrue or be payable on such Note at any time thereafter and the Noteholders shall have no recourse to the Issuer for any further payment in respect of the Notes (but without prejudice to the right of the Noteholders to receive the relevant number of Conversion Shares from the Settlement Shares Depositary).
If a Trigger Event (and consequent Automatic Conversion) occurs, Noteholders will only have the claims under their Conversion Shares, and such claims in a winding-up (Sw; likvidation) or bankruptcy (Sw; konkurs) of the Issuer are the most junior-ranking of all claims. Claims in respect of Conversion Shares are not for a fixed principal amount, but rather are limited to a share of the surplus assets (if any) remaining following payment of all amounts due in respect of the liabilities of the Issuer.
Further, the Terms and Conditions provide that neither the Issuer, nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be liable for any stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, or any other capital, issue, transfer, registration, financial transaction or documentary tax that may arise or be paid as a consequence of the delivery of Conversion Shares, which tax shall be borne solely by the relevant Noteholder. In addition, upon an
30

Automatic Conversion, the holders of Conversion Shares may be subject to capital gains tax or to Swedish withholding tax on any dividend payments and certain other distributions in relation to the Conversion Shares. Please see "Taxation - Swedish Taxation".

If a Noteholder fails to submit a Delivery Notice to the Settlement Shares Depositary in the manner and within the presribed timeframe specified in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, the Settlement Shares Depositary shall use its reasonable endeavours to sell the relevant Conversion Shares (which would otherwise have been due to such Affected Noteholder) in the open market and it shall hold the Cash Proceeds on trust (or other similar arrangement) on behalf of the Affected Noteholder, in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the Notes. There is therefore a risk that Noteholders will not receive Conversion Shares upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event.

Because a Trigger Event will occur when the CET1 Ratio of the Issuer or the Swedbank Group, as applicable, will have deteriorated significantly, any Trigger Event will likely be accompanied by a prior deterioration in the market price of the Ordinary Shares, which may be expected to continue after announcement of the relevant Trigger Event. Therefore, in the event of the occurrence of a Trigger Event, the Current Market Price of an Ordinary Share may be below the Floor Price, and investors could receive Conversion Shares at a time when the market price of the Conversion Shares is considerably less than the Conversion Price. In such circumstances, Noteholders may receive a smaller number of Conversion Shares than expected by the Noteholders. In addition, there may be a delay in a Noteholder receiving its Conversion Shares following an Automatic Conversion, during which time the market price of the Ordinary Shares may fall further. As a result, the value of the Conversion Shares received following an Automatic Conversion could be substantially lower than the price paid for the Notes at the time of their purchase.

Also, because the Notes are denominated in a currency other than SEK and any Conversion Shares will be denominated in SEK, fluctuations in the exchange rates between these two currencies may adversely affect the number of Conversion Shares delivered to a Noteholder as a result of an Automatic Conversion.

2.2.1.3

Noteholders may lose a right to dividends, distributions or other rights emanating from the Conversion Shares in the event o f liquidation (Sw: Hkvidation) or bankruptcy (Sw: konkurs) proceedings o f the Issuer prior to the registration o f such Conversion Shares with the Share Registrar or the SCRO

In the event that liquidation (Sw; likvidation) or bankruptcy (Sw; konkurs) proceedings have been initiated against the Issuer after the Conversion Date but before the Conversion Shares have been registered with the Share Registrar or the SCRO, the Conversion Shares may not be registered at all or may only be registered if the liquidator or the administrator in the bankruptcy (Sw; konkurs) (if and when appointed) so agrees. The Conversion Shares will carry a right to dividends, distributions and other rights having a record date that occurs on or after the Registration Date. If the Conversion Shares are not registered with the Share Registrar or the SCRO, the Noteholders will not have the benefit of any dividends, distributions or other rights in relation to the share capital of the Issuer emanating from the Conversion Shares which are contingent upon such registration.

2.2.1.4

In addition to a conversion o f the Notes in accordance with Condition 5 (Loss Absorption Mechanism) as described above, the Notes may also be written off, written down, converted to ordinary shares or otherwise modified in a manner which is materially adverse to investors in circumstances where the resolution authorities exercise powers under E U recovery and resolution regimes. The exercise o f any such power or any suggestion o f such exercise could materially adversely affect the rights o f Noteholders, the price or value o f their investment in the Notes and/or the ability o f the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes

On 2 July 2014, Directive 2014/59/EU providing for the establishment of an EU-wide framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (the "BRRD") entered into force.

31

The BRRD is designed to provide authorities with a credible set of tools to intervene sufficiently early and quickly in an unsound or failing institution so as to ensure the continuity of the institution's critical financial and economic functions, while minimising the impact of the institution's failure on the economy and financial system.

The BRRD provided that it would be applied by Member States from 1 January 2015, except for the general bail-in tool (see below) which was applied from 1 January 2016. The BRRD was implemented in Sweden on 1 February 2016 through the Swedish Resolutions Act (Sw. lag (2015:1016) om resolution). The BRRD contains different resolution tools and powers which may be used alone or in combination where the relevant resolution authority considers that (a) an institution is failing or likely to fail, (b) there is no reasonable prospect that any alternative private sector measures would prevent the failure of such institution within a reasonable timeframe, and (c) a resolution action is in the public interest. Among those resolution tools the bail-in tool gives resolution authorities the power to write down certain claims of unsecured creditors of a failing institution and to convert certain unsecured debt claims (including the Notes) to equity (the "general bail-in tool"). Such equity could also be subject to any future application of the general bail-in tool.

An institution will be considered as failing or likely to fail when: it is, or is likely in the near future to be, in breach of its requirements for continuing authorisation; its assets are, or are likely in the near future to be, less than its liabilities; it is, or is likely in the near future to be, unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or it requires extraordinary public financial support (except in limited circumstances).

In addition to the general bail-in tool, the BRRD provides for resolution authorities to have the further power to permanently write-down or convert into equity capital instruments such as the Notes at the point of non-viability and before any other resolution action is taken ("non-viability loss absorption"). Any shares issued to holders of the Notes upon any such conversion into equity may also be subject to any application of the general bail-in tool.

For the purposes of the application of any non-viability loss absorption measure, the point of non viability under the BRRD is the point at which the relevant authority determines that the institution or such institution's group meets the conditions for resolution (but no resolution action has yet been taken) or that the institution or such institution's group will no longer be viable unless the relevant capital instruments (such as the Notes) are written-down or converted or extraordinary public support is to be provided and without such support the appropriate authority determines that the institution or such institution's group would no longer be viable.

The powers set out in the BRRD impact how credit institutions and investment firms are managed as well as, in certain circumstances, the rights of creditors. The Noteholders may be subject to write down or conversion into equity on any application of the general bail-in tool and non-viability loss absorption, which may result in such holders losing some or all of their investment. The exercise of any power under the BRRD or any suggestion of such exercise could, therefore, materially adversely affect the rights of Noteholders, the price or value of their investment in the Notes and/or the ability of the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes.

2.2.1.5

The value o f the Notes may decline because o f changes, or perceived changes, in the CET1 Ratio o f the Issuer or the Group. The circumstances that may give rise to a Trigger Event are unpredictable, as there are a number o f factors that could affect the CET1 Ratio o f the Issuer or the Group

The market price of the Notes is expected to be affected by changes, or perceived changes, in the CET1 Ratio of the Issuer or the Group. Changes, or perceived changes, in the CET1 Ratio of the Issuer or the Group may be caused by changes in the amount of CET1 Capital and/or Risk Exposure Amount, as well as changes to their respective definition and interpretation under the Relevant Rules.

32

The Issuer only publicly reports the CET1 Ratio of the Issuer and the Group quarterly as of the period end, and therefore during the quarterly period there is no published updating of the CET1 Ratio of the Issuer or the Group and there may be no prior warning of adverse changes in the CET1 Ratio of the Issuer or the Group. The CET1 Ratio of the Issuer or the Group may fluctuate during a quarterly period, as described below. Any decline in the CET1 Ratio of the Issuer or the Group, and/or an indication that the CET1 Ratio of the Issuer or the Group is moving towards the level of a Trigger Event and that a Trigger Event may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes.
The occurrence of a Trigger Event is inherently unpredictable and depends on a number of factors, including those discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs, any of which may be outside the Issuer's control.
The calculation of the CET1 Ratio of the Issuer and the Group could be affected by one or more factors, including, among other things, changes in the mix of the Group's business, major events affecting the Group's earnings, dividend payments by the Issuer, regulatory changes (including changes to definitions and calculations of regulatory capital ratios and their components, including CET1 Capital and Risk Exposure Amount) and the Group's ability to manage assets included in its Risk Exposure Amount in both its on-going businesses and those which it may seek to exit.
The Issuer will have no obligation to consider the interests of the Noteholders in connection with the strategic decisions of the Group, including in respect of capital management. Noteholders will not have any claim against the Issuer or any other member of the Swedbank Group relating to decisions that affect the business and operations of the Swedbank Group, including its capital position, regardless of whether they result in the occurrence of a Trigger Event. Such decisions could cause Noteholders to lose all or part of the value of their investment in the Notes.
In addition, the Group has capital resources and assets included in its Risk Exposure Amount denominated in foreign currencies, and changes in foreign exchange rates will result in changes in the relevant currency equivalent value of foreign currency denominated capital resources and assets included in its Risk Exposure Amount. As a result, the CET1 Ratio of the Issuer and the Group is exposed to foreign currency movements.
The calculation of the CET1 Ratio of the Issuer and the Group may also be affected by changes in applicable accounting rules, or by changes to regulatory adjustments which modify the regulatory capital impact of accounting rules. Moreover, even if changes in applicable accounting rules, or changes to regulatory adjustments which modify accounting rules, are not yet in force as of the relevant calculation date, the Swedish FSA could require the Issuer to reflect such changes in any particular calculation of the relevant CET1 Ratio. Any decline in the CET1 Ratio of the Issuer or the Group may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes.
Because of the inherent uncertainty regarding whether a Trigger Event will occur it will be difficult to predict when, if at all, an Automatic Conversion may occur. Accordingly, the trading behaviour of the Notes is not necessarily expected to follow the trading behaviour of other types of security.
2.2.1.6 Noteholders will also bear the risk o f fluctuations in the price o f the Ordinary Shares
The market price of the Notes is expected to be affected by fluctuations in the market price of the Ordinary Shares, in particular if at any time there is a significant deterioration in the CET1 Ratio of the Issuer or the Group. It is impossible to predict whether the price of the Ordinary Shares will rise or fall. Market prices of the Ordinary Shares will be influenced by, among other things, the financial position of the Issuer and the Swedbank Group, the results of operations and political, economic, financial and other factors. Any decline in the market price of the Ordinary Shares or any indication that the CET1 Ratio of the Issuer or the Group is trending towards the occurrence of a Trigger Event may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes. The level of the CET1 Ratio of the
33

Issuer or the Group may also significantly affect the market price of the Notes and/or the Ordinary Shares.

2.2.1.7 The value o f the Notes may decline because the holders do not have anti-dilution protection in all circumstances. In particular, the occurrence o f corporate actions or events in respect of which no adjustment to the Floor Price is made may adversely affect the value o f the Notes

The number of Conversion Shares which are to be issued in respect of each Note upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event shall be determined by dividing the aggregate principal amount of such Note outstanding immediately prior to the Conversion Date by the Conversion Price (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number of Conversion Shares).

The Conversion Price will be, if the Ordinary Shares are:

(a)

then admitted to trading on a Relevant Stock Exchange, the greater of:

(i)

the Current Market Price of an Ordinary Share on the Conversion Date translated

into USD at the then Prevailing Exchange Rate; and

(ii)

the Floor Price on the Conversion Date; or

(b)

not then admitted to trading on a Relevant Stock Exchange, the Floor Price on the

Conversion Date.

The Floor Price will be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain corporate actions, as specified in Condition 5(g) (Adjustment of Floor Price) provided always that the Floor Price shall not be less than the quota value (Sw; kvotvarde) of the Ordinary Shares immediately prior to Automatic Conversion translated into USD at the then Prevailing Exchange Rate. However, save as specified in Condition 5(g) (Adjustment of Floor Price), there is no requirement that there should be an adjustment of the Floor Price for any other corporate actions or events that may affect the market price of the Conversion Shares, including, without limitation, as a result of any extraordinary distributions to the holders of Ordinary Shares.

Accordingly, the occurrence of corporate actions or events in respect of which no adjustment to the Floor Price is made may adversely affect the value of the Notes.

2.2.1.8 The Notes are deeply subordinated obligations

The Notes are unsecured, deeply subordinated obligations of the Issuer and are currently the most junior debt instruments of the Issuer, ranking behind claims of depositors of the Issuer, other unsubordinated creditors of the Issuer and subordinated creditors of the Issuer in respect of Subordinated Indebtedness other than Parity Securities and Junior Securities which comprise Subordinated Indebtedness, pari passu amongst themselves and at least pari passu with Parity Securities and currently in priority only to all Junior Securities.

In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation (Sw; likvidation) or bankruptcy (Sw; konkurs) of the Issuer, the Issuer may not have enough assets remaining after payments to such prior ranking creditors to pay amounts due under the Notes.

Despite their pari passu ranking in case of liquidation or bankruptcy, due to different trigger levels for loss absorption among the Notes and some of the Parity Securities (or, as the case may be, no loss absorption trigger event), the Notes will absorb losses of the Issuer by being converted into Ordinary Shares before holders of such Parity Securities have to suffer any losses by way of being written down. In addition, any failure to write down Parity Securities may result in the Notes being converted into Ordinary Shares sooner than expected.

34

For the avoidance of doubt, the holders of the Notes shall, in a winding-up (Sw; likvidation) or bankruptcy (Sw; konkurs) of the Issuer which commences prior to any Conversion Date, have no claim in respect of the surplus assets (if any) of the Issuer remaining in any winding-up or dissolution following payment of all amounts due in respect of the liabilities of the Issuer.

2.2.1.9 The Issuer is not prohibited from issuing further debt, which may rank pari passu with or senior to the Notes

There is no restriction on the amount or type of further securities or indebtedness that the Issuer or its subsidiaries may issue, incur or guarantee, as the case may be, that rank senior to, or pari passu with, the Notes offered hereby. The issue or guaranteeing of any such further securities or indebtedness may reduce the amount recoverable by the Noteholders in the case of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation (Sw; likvidation) or bankruptcy (Sw; konkurs) of the Issuer and may limit its ability to meet its obligations under the Notes. In addition, the Notes do not contain any restriction on the Issuer issuing securities that may have preferential rights to the Notes or securities with similar or different provisions to those described herein.

2.2.1.10 The Notes are o f a perpetual nature

The Notes have no fixed final redemption date and holders have no rights to call for the redemption of the Notes. Although the Issuer may redeem the Notes in certain circumstances there are limitations on its ability to do so. There will be no redemption at the option of the Noteholders in any circumstances. Therefore, Noteholders should be aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in such Notes for an indefinite period of time.

2.2.1.11 Notes subject to optional redemption by the Issuer or upon the occurrence of a Capital Event or a Tax Event

Subject as provided herein, in particular to Condition 6(e) (Conditions to Redemption), Condition 6(f) (Notice for redemption) and Condition 6(g) (Trigger Event), the Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, on any Optional Redemption Date at their principal amount, together with any accrued but unpaid interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled (or deemed to be cancelled in accordance with Condition 4 (Interest Cancellation)). Subject as aforesaid, upon the occurrence of a Capital Event or a Tax Event, the Issuer may also, at its option, at any time redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, together with any accrued but unpaid interest thereon insofar as it has not been cancelled (or deemed to be cancelled in accordance with Condition 4 (Interest Cancellation)).

An optional redemption feature is likely to limit the market value of the Notes. During any period when the Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes, the market value of the Notes generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any redemption period.

Upon redemption, an investor may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.

2.2.1.12 Remedies in respect o f the Notes are severely limited

The Notes will contain limited enforcement events as follows:

(i)

where the Issuer fails to pay any amount that has become due and payable under the Notes

pursuant to Condition 6(b) (Redemption for Capital Event), Condition 6(c) (Redemption for

Tax Event) or Condition 6(d) (Redemption at the option of the Issuer) (redemption under

each such condition being subject to Condition 6(e) (Conditions to Redemption), Condition

35

6(f) (Notice for redemption) and Condition 6(g) (Trigger Event)) and such failure continues for fourteen (14) days and each Noteholder may, subject to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (1987:672), institute proceedings in the Kingdom of Sweden (or such other jurisdiction in which the Issuer may be organised) (but not elsewhere) for the Issuer to be declared bankrupt and/or prove or claim in the Bankruptcy or Liquidation of the Issuer; and

(ii)

the occurrence of a Winding-up Event, where such Winding-up Event occurs before the

occurrence of a Trigger Event, the Notes will become immediately due and payable at their

principal amount, but subject to the Noteholders only being able to claim payment in respect

of the Notes in the Bankruptcy or Liquidation of the Issuer.

However, in each case, the Noteholder may claim payment in respect of the Notes only in the winding-up or, as the case may be, bankruptcy (Sw: konkurs) or liquidation (Sw: likvidation) of the Issuer.

2.2.1.13 Noteholders will have to submit a Delivery Notice in order to receive delivery o f the Conversion Shares and they (o r their nominee, custodian or other representative) w ill have to have an account withEuroclearSweden in order to receive the Conversion Shares

In order to obtain delivery of the Conversion Shares, a Noteholder must deliver a Delivery Notice (and the relevant Notes) to the Settlement Shares Depositary in accordance with the standard procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or (if the Notes are in definitive form) to the Paying and Conversion Agent. The Delivery Notice must contain certain information, including the Noteholder's Euroclear Sweden account details. Accordingly, Noteholders (or their nominee, custodian or other representative) will have to have an account with Euroclear Sweden in order to receive the Conversion Shares. If a Noteholder fails to properly complete and deliver a Delivery Notice on or before the Notice Cut-off Date, the Settlement Shares Depositary shall continue to hold the Conversion Shares on trust (or other similar arrangement) for ten (10) Business Days until a Delivery Notice (and the relevant Notes) is or are so validly delivered. The Issuer shall have no liability to any Noteholder for any loss resulting from such Noteholder not receiving any Conversion Shares or from any delay in the receipt thereof, in each case as a result of such Noteholder failing to submit a valid Delivery Notice on a timely basis or at all.

2.2.1.14 Receipt by the Settlement Shares Depositary o f the Conversion Shares shall irrevocably discharge and satisfy the Issuer's obligations in respect o f the Notes

The Issuer will deliver the relevant Conversion Shares to the Settlement Shares Depositary on the Registration Date, and the Settlement Shares Depositary will hold the Conversion Shares on behalf of the Noteholders. Receipt by the Settlement Shares Depositary of the Conversion Shares shall irrevocably discharge and satisfy the Issuer's obligations in respect of the Notes and a Noteholder shall, with effect on and from the Registration Date, only have recourse to the Settlement Shares Depositary for the delivery to it of the relevant Conversion Shares. The Issuer shall not have any liability for the performance of the obligations of the Settlement Shares Depositary.

In addition, the Issuer has not yet appointed a Settlement Shares Depositary and the Issuer may not be able to appoint a Settlement Shares Depositary if an Automatic Conversion occurs. In such a scenario, the Issuer would inform Noteholders of any alternative arrangements in connection with the issuance and/or delivery of the Conversion Shares, and such arrangements may be disadvantageous to, and more restrictive on, the Noteholders. For example, such arrangements may involve Noteholders having to wait longer to receive their Conversion Shares than would be the case under the arrangements expected to be entered into with a Settlement Shares Depositary. An issue of the Conversion Shares by the Issuer to the relevant recipient in accordance with these alternative arrangements shall constitute a complete and irrevocable release of all of the Issuer's obligations in respect of the Notes.

36

2.2.1.15 Noteholders may be obliged to make a takeover bid upon the occurrence o f the Trigger Event if they take delivery o f Conversion Shares
Upon the occurrence of the Trigger Event, a Noteholder receiving Conversion Shares may have to make a takeover bid addressed to all the shareholders of the Issuer pursuant to the Swedish Stock Market (Takeover Bids) Act (2006:451) (as amended or replaced from time to time) implementing Directive 2004/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council if its aggregate holding of voting rights in the Issuer (or its voting rights aggregated with those of its related parties) represent at least 30 per cent. of all the voting rights in the Issuer.
2.2.1.16 Noteholders who receive Conversion Shares upon the occurrence o f a Trigger Event may be subject to disclosure obligations and/or may need approval by the Issuer's regulators and other authorities
As the Notes are convertible into Conversion Shares in certain circumstances, an investment in the Notes may result in a Noteholder, upon conversion of its Notes into Conversion Shares, having to comply with certain disclosure and/or approval requirements pursuant to the Swedish Banking and Financing Business Act (2004:297) and the Swedish Financial Instruments Trading Act (1991:980) (each as amended or replaced from time to time) and other laws and regulations. Non-compliance with such disclosure and/or approval requirements may lead to the incurrence by the Noteholder of substantial fines and/or suspension of voting rights associated with the Conversion Shares.
2.2.1.17 Noteholders who receive Conversion Shares may be subject to compulsory acquisition proceedings in relation to their Conversion Shares
Pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551), a shareholder that directly or indirectly holds more than 90 per cent. of the shares of the Issuer is entitled to acquire the other shareholders' shares and each minority shareholder is entitled to require such majority shareholder to acquire its shares. A majority shareholder that exercises such right to acquire the outstanding shares in the Issuer is also entitled to acquire any convertibles (including the Notes) or warrants issued by the Issuer. Each holder of such convertibles or warrants (including the Noteholders) is entitled to require the majority shareholder to acquire its convertibles (including the Notes) or warrants notwithstanding that the majority shareholder does not exercise its right to acquire the outstanding shares. If an agreement on the purchase price cannot be reached between the parties, the purchase price shall be determined through arbitration and generally be the price which could be expected in a sale under normal circumstances. A shareholder or a holder of a convertible or a warrant who does not participate in the arbitration will be represented by a trustee appointed by the SCRO.
2.2.1.18 The Notes will be repaid if the Issuer fails to register the resolution to issue the Notes with the SCRO within the prescribed timeframe
The issue of the Notes must comply with certain procedural requirements laid down in the Swedish Companies Act. Under such Act, the Issuer must register with the SCRO its resolution to issue the Notes within six months of such resolution being made. If the Issuer fails to comply with this registration requirement or if the resolution for any other reason is not registered, the resolution to issue the Notes will cease to be valid and the Issuer will be obliged under the Swedish Companies Act to repay any sums paid for subscribed Notes, together with interest according to the Swedish Interest Act (Sw: rфntelagen). In addition, potential investors should note that it is unclear how such repayment would be practically operated.
An investor generally may not be able to reinvest the repaid sums at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being repaid and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower interest rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time.
37

2.2.1.19 Notes are not aggregated for the purposes o f determining the number o f Conversion Shares to be issued in respect o f a Noteholder's holding in the Notes
If one or more Delivery Notices and relevant Notes are delivered by a Noteholder to the Settlement Shares Depositary (as provided in Condition 5(d) (Settlement Procedure)) such that any Conversion Shares to be issued and delivered to such Noteholder following an Automatic Conversion are to be registered in the same name, the number of Conversion Shares to be issued and delivered in respect thereof shall be calculated on the basis of individual Notes and not on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes to be converted.
The number of Conversion Shares to be issued in respect of each Note shall be determined in accordance with the calculation in Condition 5(c) (The Conversion Shares) and such calculation shall be rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number of Conversion Shares. Fractions of Conversion Shares will not be issued following an Automatic Conversion and no cash payment will be made in lieu thereof. There is therefore a risk that a Noteholder submitting more than one Delivery Notice may receive fewer Conversion Shares than it would otherwise have received had its holding in the Notes been aggregated (where the aggregate principal amount of a Noteholder's Notes would have qualified such Noteholder for additional Conversion Shares when calculated in accordance with Condition 5(c) (The Conversion Shares)).
2.2.1.20 In certain circumstances, the Issuer can substitute or vary the terms o f the Notes
If at any time a Capital Event or a Tax Event occurs, the Issuer may, subject to obtaining the prior permission of the Swedish FSA (without any requirement for the consent or approval of the Noteholders) either substitute all (but not some only) of the Notes for Qualifying Additional Tier 1 Securities, or vary the terms of the Notes so that they remain or, as appropriate, become, Qualifying Additional Tier 1 Securities as further provided in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes. The terms and conditions of such substituted or varied Notes may have terms and conditions that contain one or more provisions that are substantially different from the terms and conditions of the original Notes, provided that the Notes remain or, as appropriate, become, Qualifying Additional Tier 1 Securities in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the Notes.
While the Issuer cannot make changes to the terms of the Notes that, in its reasonable opinion (following consultation with an investment bank or financial advisor of international standing which is independent of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries), are materially less favourable to Noteholders as a class, no assurance can be given as to whether any of these changes will negatively affect any particular Noteholder. In addition, the tax and stamp duty consequences of holding such substituted or varied Notes could be different for some categories of Noteholders from the tax and stamp duty consequences for them of holding the Notes prior to such substitution or variation.
2.2.1.21 Uncertainties remain regarding the manner in which CRD IV will be interpreted
The defined terms in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes will depend in some cases on the final interpretation of CRD IV. CRD IV is a recently-adopted set of rules and regulations that imposes a series of new requirements, many of which will be phased in over a number of years. Certain portions of CRD IV required transposition into Swedish law, and although the CRR will be directly applicable in each Member State, the CRR leaves a number of important interpretational issues to be resolved through binding technical standards that have been adopted, and will be adopted in the future, and leaves certain other matters to the discretion of the Relevant Regulator. The manner in which the framework and requirements under CRD IV will be applied to the Issuer and the Group remains uncertain to a degree.
Such uncertainty relating to future interpretation may have a material impact on the market price of the Notes and/or the ability to accurately value the Notes.
38

2.2.1.22 Any failure by the Issuer and/or the Group to comply with its MREL requirement could result, among other things, in the imposition o f restrictions or prohibitions on discretionary payments by the Issuer, including interest payments on the Notes
For a discussion as to how MREL requirements may affect Swedbank, see risk factor 2.1.15 "Swedbank or its financial institution subsidiaries may need additional capital in the future to maintain capital adequacy ratios or for other reasons, and it may be difficult to obtain such capital".
As outlined in risk factor 2.1.15 above the regulatory framework around the MREL requirement, including its implementation in Sweden, is not yet in final form and is also the subject of the Proposals. If the Proposals are adopted in their current form, a failure by the Issuer or the Group to comply with the MREL requirement means the Issuer could become subject to the restrictions on payments on Additional Tier 1 securities, including the Notes (subject to a potential six month grace period). If the Issuer becomes subject to these restrictions, the Proposals provide that any discretionary payments on the Notes and other Additional Tier 1 securities (which will be subject to the maximum distributable amount restrictions) should be prioritised over distributions on CET1 capital or discretionary employee bonus/pension payments.
2.2.2 Risks relating to the Market Generally
2.2.2.1 The Secondary Market Generally
The Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a market does develop, it may not be liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. Illiquidity may have a severely adverse effect on the market value of the Notes.
2.2.2.2 Lack o f Liquidity in the Secondary Market may adversely affect the Market Value o f the Notes
Generally weak global credit market conditions could contribute to a lack of liquidity in the secondary market for instruments similar to the Notes. In addition, the recent liquidity crisis has limited the primary market for a number of financial products, including instruments similar to the Notes. While some measures have been taken by governments, there can be no assurance that the market for securities similar to the Notes will recover, either at all or at the same time or to the same degree as any other recovering global credit market sectors.
A failure of the market for securities similar to the Notes to recover could adversely affect the market value of the Notes.
2.2.2.3 Exchange Rate Risks and Exchange Controls
The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in U.S. dollars. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than U.S. dollars. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of U.S. dollars or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to U.S. dollars would decrease (i) the Investor's Currency-equivalent yield on the Notes, (ii) the Investor's Currency equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (iii) the Investor's Currency equivalent market value of the Notes.
Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate or the ability of the Issuer to make payments in respect of the Notes. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal.
39

2.2.2.4 Interest Rate Risks
Notwithstanding that the rate of interest applicable to the Notes will be reset on the First Call Date and on each Reset Date thereafter, an investment in the Notes involves the risk that subsequent changes in market interest rates during the Initial Period or, as the case may be, during a Reset Interest Period may adversely affect the value of the Notes. Following the First Call Date, there is a risk that the rate of interest applicable to the Notes could be less than the Initial Rate of Interest or, as the case may be, the rate of interest applicable to the Notes may be less than the rate of interest applicable to the previous Reset Interest Period(s), which could affect the market value of an investment in the Notes.
In addition, a holder of securities with a fixed interest rate that will be periodically reset during the term of the relevant securities, such as the Notes, is also exposed to the risk of fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertain interest income.
2.2.2.5 Credit Ratings may not reflect all risks
The Notes are expected to be assigned the following ratings: BBB by S&P, BBB by Fitch and Baa3 by Moody's. There is no guarantee that such ratings will be assigned or maintained or that such credit ratings reflect the potential impact of all risks related to an investment in the Notes. Rating agencies may change their rating methodologies, which could lead to a change in the credit ratings assigned to the Notes. Accordingly, a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Notes and may be revised, suspended or withdrawn by the relevant rating agency at any time. Any such revision, suspension or withdrawal could adversely affect the market value of the Notes.
2.2.3 General Risks Relating to Notes
2.2.3.1 Modification and Waiver
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes and the Agency Agreement contain provisions for convening meetings of holders of the Notes to consider any matter affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all holders of the Notes including holders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and holders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes also provide that, subject to Condition 14(c) (Relevant Regulator notice or permission), the Notes and the Terms and Conditions may be amended without the consent of the Noteholders or the Couponholders to correct a manifest error. In addition, the parties to the Agency Agreement may agree to modify any provision thereof, but the Issuer shall not agree without the consent of the Noteholders to any such modification unless it is of a formal, minor or technical nature, it is made to correct a manifest error or it is, in the opinion of such parties, not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders.
2.2.3.2 Change o f Law
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the Notes are governed by English law, except for Condition 2 (Status) and any non contractual obligations in relation thereto, any conversion of the Notes into Ordinary Shares and any Compulsory Acquisition Proceedings which shall be governed by Swedish law. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to English or Swedish law or administrative practice on or after the date of issue of the Notes and any such change could materially adversely impact the value of the Notes.
2.2.3.3 Reliance on Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg procedures
The Notes will be represented on issue by a Global Note that will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Except in the circumstances described in the Global Notes, investors will not be entitled to receive Notes in definitive form. Euroclear and
40

Clearstream, Luxembourg will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the Global Notes. While the Notes are in global form, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be. While the Notes are in global form, the Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under the Notes by making payments to a common depositary. A holder of a beneficial interest in a Note must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, to receive payments under the Notes. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in such a Global Note.

Terms and Conditions

The U.S.$500,000,000 Fixed Rate Reset Additional Tier 1 Convertible Notes (the "Notes") of Swedbank AB (publ), a company incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Sweden and having registration number 502017-7753 (the "Issuer"), are the subject of a fiscal agency agreement dated the Issue Date (the "Agency Agreement") between the Issuer, Citibank N.A., London Branch as fiscal agent (the "Fiscal Agent", which expression includes any successor fiscal agent appointed from time to time in connection with the Notes), Citibank N.A., London Branch as the paying and conversion agent (the "Paying and Conversion Agent", which expression includes any successor paying and conversion agents appointed from time to time in connection with the Notes), the paying agents named therein (the "Paying Agents", which expression includes any successor paying agents appointed from time to time in connection with the Notes) and Citibank N.A., London Branch as calculation agent (the "Calculation Agent", which expression includes any successor calculation agent appointed from time to time in connection with the Notes). Certain provisions of these Conditions are summaries of the Agency Agreement and subject to its detailed provisions. The holders of the Notes (the "Noteholders") and the holders of the related interest coupons (the "Couponholders" and the "Coupons", respectively) are bound by, and are deemed to have notice of, all the provisions of the Agency Agreement applicable to them. Copies of the Agency Agreement are available for inspection by Noteholders during normal business hours at the Specified Offices (as defined in the Agency Agreement) of each of the Paying Agents, the initial Specified Offices of which are set out below.

1.

Form, Denomination and Title

The Notes are serially numbered and in bearer form in the denomination of U.S.$200,000 with Coupons and talons (each, a "Talon") for further Coupons attached at the time of issue. Title to the Notes, the Coupons and the Talons will pass by delivery. The holder of any Note, Coupon or Talon shall (except as otherwise required by law) be treated as its absolute owner for all purposes (whether or not it is overdue and regardless of any notice of ownership, trust or any other interest therein, any writing thereon or any notice of any previous loss or theft thereof) and no person shall be liable for so treating such holder. No person shall have any right to enforce any term or condition of the Notes under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

2.

Status

Unless previously converted into Conversion Shares pursuant to Condition 5 (Loss Absorption Mechanism), the Notes constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated debt obligations of the Issuer and further entail an obligation for the Noteholders to have their Notes converted into Ordinary Shares as set forth in Chapter 15 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw: aktiebolagslagen (2005:551) (the "Swedish Companies Act") and in these Conditions.

In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation (Sw: likvidation) ("Liquidation") or bankruptcy (Sw: konkurs) ("Bankruptcy") of the Issuer, the rights and claims (if any) of the Noteholders in respect of or arising from the Notes (including any accrued but uncancelled interest or damages awarded for breach of any obligations under these Conditions, if any are payable) shall rank:

(A)

junior in right of payments to the payment of any present or future claims of (a) depositors of

the Issuer, (b) other unsubordinated creditors of the Issuer, and (c) subordinated creditors of

the Issuer in respect of Subordinated Indebtedness other than Parity Securities and Junior

Securities which comprise Subordinated Indebtedness;

(B)

pari passu without any preference among themselves;

(C)

at least pari passu with payments to holders of present or future outstanding Parity

Securities; and

43

(D)

in priority to payments to holders of present or future outstanding Junior Securities.

In the event of the Liquidation or Bankruptcy of the Issuer that occurs after the date on which a Trigger Event occurs but before the Registration Date, the rights and claims (if any) of the Noteholders in respect of their Notes shall be limited to such amount, if any, as would have been payable to Noteholders on a return of assets in such Liquidation or Bankruptcy of the Issuer if the Registration Date had occurred immediately before the occurrence of such Liquidation or Bankruptcy of the Issuer.

No right of set-off or counterclaim

No Noteholder who shall in the event of the Liquidation or Bankruptcy of the Issuer be indebted to the Issuer shall be entitled to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim against moneys owed by the Issuer in respect of the Notes held by such Noteholder.

3.

Interest

(a)

Interest Rate: The Notes bear interest from (and including) 16 December 2016 (the "Issue

Date") at the relevant Rate of Interest.

(b)

Interest Payment Dates: Interest will be payable in arrear on 17 March and 17 September in

each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), and the first payment of interest shall be

made on 17 March 2017 in respect of the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but

excluding) such Interest Payment Date, all subject as provided in Condition 4 (Interest

Cancellation), Condition 5 (Loss Absorption Mechanism) and Condition 7 (Payments)

below.

(c)

Accrual of Interest: Each Note will cease to bear interest from (and including) the due date

for redemption pursuant to Condition 6 (Redemption and Purchase).

(d)

Interest to (but excluding) the First Call Date: Subject as provided in Condition 4 (Interest

Cancellation), Condition 5 (Loss Absorption Mechanism) and Condition 7 (Payments)

below, for each Interest Period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the

First Call Date, the amount of interest per Calculation Amount payable on:

(i)

each Interest Payment Date (other than the first Interest Payment Date) will be

U.S.$6,000.00; and

(ii)

the first Interest Payment Date will be U.S.$3,033.33.

(e)

Interest from (and including) the First Call Date: The rate of interest for each Interest Period

from (and including) the First Call Date will be equal to the sum of (i) the Reference Rate in

respect of the Reset Interest Period in which such Interest Period falls and (ii) the Margin, all

as determined by the Calculation Agent.

(f)

Determination of Reference Rate in relation to a Reset Interest Period: The Calculation

Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on each Reference

Rate Determination Date in relation to a Reset Interest Period, determine the Reference

Rate for such Reset Interest Period and calculate the amount of interest payable per

Calculation Amount on the Interest Payment Dates in relation to each Interest Period falling

in such Reset Interest Period (each a "Reset Interest Amount").

44

(g)

Publication of Reference Rate and Reset Interest Amount: With respect to each Reset

Interest Period, the Calculation Agent will cause the relevant Reference Rate and the

relevant Reset Interest Amount determined by it, together with the relevant Interest

Payment Dates in relation to each Interest Period falling in such Reset Interest Period, to be

notified to the Paying Agents and each listing authority, stock exchange and/or quotation

system (if any) by which the Notes have then been admitted to listing, trading and/or

quotation as soon as practicable after such determination but in any event not later than the

relevant Reset Date. Notice thereof shall also promptly be given to the Noteholders in

accordance with Condition 17 (Notices).

(h)

Calculation of amount of interest per Calculation Amount: Save as specified in Condition

3(d) (Interest to (but excluding) the First Call Date), and subject as provided in Condition 4

(Interest Cancellation), Condition 5 (Loss Absorption Mechanism) and Condition 7

(Payments) below, the amount of interest payable in respect of the Calculation Amount

(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Reset Interest Amount) for any period shall be

calculated by:

(i)

applying the applicable Rate of Interest to the Calculation Amount;

(ii)

multiplying the product thereof by the Day Count Fraction; and

(iii)

rounding the resulting figure to the nearest cent (half a cent being rounded

upwards).

(i)

Calculation of amount of interest per Note: Subject as provided in Condition 4 (Interest

Cancellation), Condition 5 (Loss Absorption Mechanism) and Condition 7 (Payments)

below, the amount of interest payable in respect of a Note shall be the product of:

(i)

the amount of interest per Calculation Amount; and

(ii)

the number by which the Calculation Amount is required to be multiplied to equal

the denomination of such Note.

(j)

Notifications etc: All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations,

quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of this

Condition by the Calculation Agent will (in the absence of manifest error) be binding on the

Issuer, the Paying Agents, the Noteholders and the Couponholders and (subject as

aforesaid) no liability to any such Person will attach to the Calculation Agent in connection

with the exercise or non-exercise by it of its powers, duties and discretions for such

purposes.

4.

Interest Cancellation

(a)

Discretionary Interest Payments: Interest on the Notes is due and payable only at the sole

and absolute discretion of the Issuer, and the Issuer shall have sole and absolute discretion

at all times to cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment that would otherwise be due

and payable on any Interest Payment Date. If the Issuer does not make an interest payment

on the relevant Interest Payment Date (or if the Issuer elects to make a payment of a

portion, but not all, of such interest payment), such non-payment shall evidence the Issuer's

exercise of its discretion to cancel such interest payment (or the portion of such interest

payment not paid), and accordingly such interest payment (or the portion thereof not paid)

shall not be due and payable.

If the Issuer provides notice to cancel a portion, but not all, of an interest payment and the Issuer subsequently does not make a payment of the remaining portion of such interest payment on the relevant Interest Payment Date, such non-payment shall evidence the

45

Issuer's exercise of its discretion to cancel such remaining portion of the interest payment, and accordingly such remaining portion of the interest payment shall also not be due and payable.

(b)

Restriction on Interest Payments: Payments of interest in respect of the Notes in any

financial year of the Issuer shall be made only out of Distributable Items of the Issuer. To

the extent that the Issuer has insufficient Distributable Items to make any payment of

interest in respect of the Notes scheduled for payment in the then current financial year and

any other interest payments or distributions paid and/or required and/or scheduled to be

paid out of Distributable Items in such financial year in accordance with the Relevant Rules,

in each case excluding any portion of such payments already accounted for in determining

the Distributable Items of the Issuer, then the Issuer will, without prejudice to the right above

to cancel all such payments of interest in respect of the Notes, make partial or, as the case

may be, no such payment of interest in respect of the Notes.

(c)

Effect of Interest Cancellation: Interest will only be due and payable on an Interest Payment

Date to the extent it is not cancelled or deemed cancelled in accordance with Condition 4(a)

(Discretionary Interest Payments) and Condition 4(b) (Restriction on Interest Payments)

above. Any interest cancelled or deemed cancelled (in each case, in whole or in part) in

such circumstances shall not be due and shall not accumulate or be payable at any time

thereafter nor shall any non-payment of such interest constitute an event of default under

Condition 10 (Winding-Up, Non-payment, Breach of Obligations, Remedies), and

Noteholders shall have no rights thereto or to receive any additional interest or

compensation as a result of such cancellation or deemed cancellation. The Issuer may use

such cancelled payments without restriction to meet its obligations as they fall due.

(d)

Notice of Interest Cancellation: If practicable, the Issuer shall provide notice of any

cancellation or deemed cancellation of interest (in whole or in part) to the Noteholders on or

prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date. If practicable, the Issuer shall endeavour to

provide such notice at least five (5) Business Days prior to the relevant Interest Payment

Date. Failure to provide such notice will not have any impact on the effectiveness of, or

otherwise invalidate, any such cancellation or deemed cancellation of interest, or give

Noteholders any rights as a result of such failure.

5.

Loss Absorption Mechanism

(a)

Automatic Conversion Upon Trigger Event

(i)

Automatic Conversion: If a Trigger Event occurs at any time, then an Automatic

Conversion will be deemed to have occurred immediately at such time (the date

on which such Trigger Event occurs being the "Conversion Date"), and the Notes

will be converted into Conversion Shares at the Conversion Price as provided in

this Condition 5.

(ii)

Effect of Automatic Conversion: From and including the Conversion Date:

(A)

the principal amount of the Notes will be written down to zero and,

accordingly, the principal amount of the Notes shall equal zero at all

times thereafter;

(B)

any interest in respect of an Interest Period ending on any Interest

Payment Date falling on or after the Conversion Date shall be

automatically cancelled and shall not be due and payable;

(C)

no Noteholder will have any rights against the Issuer with respect to the

repayment of the principal amount of the Notes or the payment of

46

interest or any other amount on or in respect of such Notes, which obligations and liabilities of the Issuer shall be irrevocably and automatically released; and

(D)

subject to the last paragraph of Condition 5(d) (Settlement Procedure),

the Issuer's only obligations and liabilities under the Notes shall be an

obligation to deliver Conversion Shares to the Settlement Shares

Depositary on behalf of the Noteholders on the Registration Date in

accordance with this Condition 5.

An Automatic Conversion shall not constitute an event of default or a breach of the Issuer's obligations or duties under these Conditions or a failure to perform by the Issuer in any manner whatsoever and shall not entitle Noteholders to petition for the insolvency or dissolution of the Issuer or otherwise.

(iii)

No option to convert: The Notes are not convertible into Conversion Shares at the

option of the Noteholders or the Issuer at any time.

(b)

Automatic Conversion Procedure

If an Automatic Conversion has occurred, the Issuer shall immediately inform the Relevant Regulator and shall deliver an Automatic Conversion Notice to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices) and to the Fiscal Agent on or within five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of the Trigger Event (or within such shorter period as the Relevant Regulator may require).

Failure to provide such notice will not have any impact on the effectiveness of, or otherwise invalidate, any such Automatic Conversion, or give Noteholders any rights as a result of such failure.

(c)

The Conversion Shares

The number of Conversion Shares which are to be issued in respect of each Note shall be determined by dividing the aggregate principal amount of such Note outstanding immediately prior to the Conversion Date by the Conversion Price rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number of Conversion Shares. Fractions of Conversion Shares will not be issued following an Automatic Conversion and no cash payment will be made in lieu thereof.

The Conversion Shares resulting from an Automatic Conversion will be fully paid and non assessable and will in all respects rank pari passu with all other Ordinary Shares in issue on the Registration Date, except in any such case for any right excluded by mandatory provisions of applicable law and except that the Conversion Shares so issued will not rank for the purposes of (or, as the case may be, the relevant Noteholder shall not be entitled to receive) any rights, the entitlement to which falls prior to the Conversion Date. The Conversion Shares will carry a right to dividends, distributions and rights having a record date that occurs on or after the registration of the Conversion Shares (whether in the form of interim shares or regular shares) with the Share Registrar (the date such registration occurs being the "Registration Date").

(d)

Settlement Procedure

Subject to the last paragraph of this Condition 5(d), the obligation of the Issuer to issue and deliver Conversion Shares to a Noteholder shall be satisfied by the delivery of the Conversion Shares in respect of the Note(s) of such Noteholder to the Settlement Shares Depositary on the Registration Date. Such delivery will be deemed to have occurred when

47

the Conversion Shares are registered (whether as interim shares or regular shares) in the name of the Settlement Shares Depositary by the Share Registrar. With effect on and from the Registration Date, a Noteholder shall have recourse only to the Settlement Shares Depositary for the delivery of the number of Conversion Shares determined in respect of its Note(s) in accordance with Condition 5(c) (The Conversion Shares).

Delivery of the Conversion Shares by the Settlement Shares Depositary to the Noteholders will be made solely by book-entry with the Share Registrar and no physical share certificate will be delivered to any Noteholder in respect of any Conversion Share. Such delivery to a Noteholder will be made in accordance with the following procedures:

(i)

on the Registration Date, the Issuer shall deliver (in accordance with the first

paragraph of this Condition 5(d)) to the Settlement Shares Depositary such

number of Conversion Shares as is required to satisfy in full its obligation to

deliver Conversion Shares on the Registration Date;

(ii)

following the delivery by the Issuer of an Automatic Conversion Notice, each

Noteholder shall deliver a duly completed irrevocable Delivery Notice to the

Paying and Conversion Agent at its specified office, together with its Notes, within

the period of five (5) business days (in the relevant place of delivery) from (and

including) the delivery of the Automatic Conversion Notice to the Noteholders in

accordance with Condition 5(b) (Automatic Conversion Procedure) (the date on

which such period expires being the "Notice Cut-off Date");

(iii)

the Paying and Conversion Agent shall give instructions to the Settlement Shares

Depositary for the relevant Conversion Shares to be delivered by the Settlement

Shares Depositary to each Noteholder on the Registration Date or as soon as

practicable thereafter in accordance with the instructions given in the relevant

Delivery Notice, provided that such duly completed Delivery Notice and the

relevant Notes have been so delivered to the Paying and Conversion Agent not

later than the Notice Cut-off Date;

(iv)

any determination as to whether any Delivery Notice has been properly completed

and delivered together with the relevant Note(s) as provided in these Conditions

shall be made by the Settlement Shares Depositary in its sole discretion and shall

be conclusive and binding on the relevant Noteholder; and

(v)

in the case of any Noteholder which fails to deliver a valid Delivery Notice prior to

the Notice Cut-off Date (each, an "Affected Noteholder"), the relevant Conversion

Shares shall, for a period of ten (10) Business Days from (and including) the

Notice Cut-Off Date, continue to be held on trust (or other similar arrangement) by

the Settlement Shares Depositary for such Noteholder until such Noteholder

delivers a duly completed Delivery Notice and the relevant Note(s) and subject to

Condition 5(e)(i) below. Following such ten (10) Business Day period, the

Settlement Shares Depositary shall use its reasonable endeavours to sell the

relevant Conversion Shares in the open market and it shall hold the cash

proceeds (the "Cash Proceeds") received from such sale (after deduction of any

costs or expenses incurred by it in relation thereto) on trust (or other similar

arrangement) on behalf of the Affected Noteholder until such Affected Noteholder

delivers a duly completed Delivery Notice, subject to a ten (10) year prescription

period and subject to Condition 5(e)(i) below.

For so long as the Conversion Shares are held by the Settlement Shares Depositary on behalf of each Noteholder, the Settlement Shares Depositary, subject to applicable laws, shall also hold any Cash Dividends and any other dividends or rights distributed to all other

48

Shareholders as a class in respect of such Conversion Shares on trust (or other similar arrangement) for such Noteholder. The Settlement Shares Depositary shall use its reasonable endeavours to sell any such rights in the open market before expiry and it shall hold the cash proceeds received from such sale (after deduction of any costs or expenses incurred by it in relation thereto) on trust (or other similar arrangement) on behalf of each Noteholder. Cash Dividend(s) (and other dividends or rights or proceeds therefrom) shall be paid to the relevant Noteholder in accordance with the instructions given in the relevant Delivery Notice.

If the Issuer has been unable to appoint a Settlement Shares Depositary prior to the last date on which it is permitted to deliver the Automatic Conversion Notice, it shall make such other arrangements for the issuance and/or delivery of the Conversion Shares to the Noteholders as it shall consider reasonable in the circumstances, which may include issuing the Conversion Shares to the Noteholders directly, which issuance shall irrevocably and automatically release all of the Issuer's obligations under the Notes as if the Conversion Shares had been issued to the Settlement Shares Depositary. In such circumstances, the Issuer will specify details about the relevant arrangements in the Automatic Conversion Notice.

(e)

Entitlement to Conversion Shares or Cash Proceeds

(i)

Any Affected Noteholder delivering a Delivery Notice after the Notice Cut-off Date

will have to provide evidence of its entitlement to the relevant Conversion Shares

or Cash Proceeds (as the case may be) satisfactory to the Settlement Shares

Depositary in its sole and absolute discretion in order to receive delivery of such

Conversion Shares or Cash Proceeds (as the case may be).

(ii)

Neither the Settlement Shares Depositary nor the Issuer shall have any liability to

any Noteholder for any loss resulting from such Noteholder not receiving any

Conversion Shares (or Cash Proceeds) or from any delay in the receipt thereof, in

each case as a result of such Noteholder failing to duly submit a Delivery Notice

and the relevant Notes, if applicable, on a timely basis or at all.

(iii)

Neither the Issuer nor the Settlement Shares Depositary shall have any liability in

respect of the sale of any Conversion Shares or rights, whether for the timing of

any such sale or the price at or manner in which any such Conversion Shares or

rights are sold or the inability to sell any such Conversion Shares or rights.

(f)

Taxes

Neither the Issuer, nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be liable for any stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, or any other capital, issue, transfer, registration, financial transaction or documentary tax that may arise or be paid as a consequence of the delivery of Conversion Shares, which tax shall be borne solely by the Noteholder.

(g)

Adjustment of Floor Price

Upon the happening of any of the events described below, the Floor Price shall be adjusted as follows, provided always, that the Floor Price shall not be less than the quota value (Sw; kvotvфrde) of the Ordinary Shares immediately prior to Automatic Conversion translated into USD at the then Prevailing Exchange Rate:

(i)

If and whenever there shall be a consolidation (Sw: sammanlфggning),

reclassification (Sw; omvandling) or subdivision (Sw; uppdelning) in relation to the

Ordinary Shares which alters the number of Ordinary Shares in issue, the Floor

49

Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Floor Price in force immediately prior to such consolidation, reclassification or subdivision by the following fraction:

A B

where:

A

is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately before

such consolidation, reclassification or subdivision, as the case may be;

and

B

is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately after,

and as a result of, such consolidation, reclassification or subdivision, as

the case may be.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the date the consolidation, reclassification or subdivision, as the case may be, takes effect.

(ii)

If and whenever the Issuer shall issue any Ordinary Shares to Shareholders as a

class credited as fully paid by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves (Sw;

fondemission) (including any share premium account or capital redemption

reserve), the Floor Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Floor Price in force

immediately prior to such issue by the following fraction:

A B

where:

A

is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately before

such issue; and

B

is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately after

such issue.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the date of issue of such Ordinary Shares.

(iii)

If and whenever the Issuer shall issue Ordinary Shares to all or substantially all

Shareholders as a class by way of rights, or the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or

(at the direction or request or pursuant to arrangements with the Issuer or any of

its Subsidiaries) any other company, person or entity shall issue or grant to

Shareholders as a class by way of rights, any options, warrants or other rights to

subscribe for or purchase Ordinary Shares, or any Securities which by their terms

of issue carry (directly or indirectly) rights of conversion into, or exchange or

subscription for, any Ordinary Shares (or shall grant any such rights in respect of

existing Securities so issued), in each case at a price per Ordinary Share which is

less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on the

relevant Effective Date, the Floor Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Floor

Price in force immediately prior to the relevant Effective Date by the following

fraction:

A+B A+C

50

where:

A

is the number of Ordinary Shares in issue on the relevant Effective Date;

B

is the number of Ordinary Shares which the aggregate consideration (if

any) receivable for the Ordinary Shares issued by way of rights, or for

the Securities issued by way of rights, or for the options or warrants or

other rights issued by way of rights and for the total number of Ordinary

Shares deliverable on the exercise thereof, would purchase at such

Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on the relevant Effective Date;

and

C

is the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued or, as the case may be,

the maximum number of Ordinary Shares which may be issued upon

exercise of such options, warrants or rights calculated as at the date of

issue of such options, warrants or rights or upon conversion or

exchange or exercise of rights of subscription or purchase in respect

thereof at the initial conversion, exchange, subscription or purchase

price or rate,

provided that if, on the relevant Effective Date, such number of Ordinary Shares is to be determined by reference to the application of a formula or other variable feature or the occurrence of any event at some subsequent time, then for the purposes of this Condition 5(g)(iii), "C" shall be determined by the application of such formula or variable feature or as if the relevant event occurs or had occurred as at the relevant Effective Date and as if such conversion, exchange, subscription, purchase or acquisition had taken place on the relevant Effective Date.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the relevant Effective Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions:

(A)

where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment pursuant to this

Condition 5(g) have already resulted or will result in an adjustment to the Floor

Price or where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment arise by

virtue of any other events or circumstances which have already given or will give

rise to an adjustment to the Floor Price or where more than one event which gives

rise to an adjustment to the Floor Price occurs within such a short period of time

that, in the opinion of the Issuer, a modification to the operation of the adjustment

provisions is required to give the intended result, such modification shall be made

to the operation of the adjustment provisions as may be determined in good faith

by an Independent Adviser to be in its opinion appropriate to give the intended

result;

(B)

such modification shall be made to the operation of these Conditions as may be

determined in good faith by an Independent Adviser to be in its opinion

appropriate (i) to ensure that an adjustment to the Floor Price or the economic

effect thereof shall not be taken into account more than once, and (ii) to reflect a

redenomination of the issued Ordinary Shares for the time being into a new

currency; and

(C)

for the avoidance of doubt, the issue of Ordinary Shares upon an Automatic

Conversion or upon any conversion or exchange in respect of any other Securities

51

or the exercise of any other options, warrants or other rights shall not result in an adjustment to the Floor Price.

(h)

Determination of Consideration Receivable

For the purpose of any calculation of the consideration receivable or price pursuant to Condition 5(g)(iii), the following provisions shall apply:

(i)

the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary Shares issued for

cash shall be the amount of such cash;

(ii)

(x) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary Shares to be

issued or otherwise made available upon the conversion or exchange of any

Securities shall be deemed to be the consideration or price received or receivable

for any such Securities and (y) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for

Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the exercise of

rights of subscription attached to any Securities or upon the exercise of any

options, warrants or rights shall be deemed to be that part (which may be the

whole) of the consideration or price received or receivable for such Securities or,

as the case may be, for such options, warrants or rights which are attributed by

the Issuer to such rights of subscription or, as the case may be, such options,

warrants or rights or, if no part of such consideration or price is so attributed, the

Fair Market Value of such rights of subscription or, as the case may be, such

options, warrants or rights as at the relevant Effective Date, plus in the case of

each of (x) and (y) above, the additional minimum consideration receivable or

price (if any) upon the conversion or exchange of such Securities, or upon the

exercise of such rights of subscription attached thereto or, as the case may be,

upon exercise of such options, warrants or rights and (z) the consideration

receivable or price per Ordinary Share upon the conversion or exchange of, or

upon the exercise of such rights of subscription attached to, such Securities or, as

the case may be, upon the exercise of such options, warrants or rights shall be

the aggregate consideration or price referred to in (x) or (y) above (as the case

may be) divided by the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued upon such

conversion or exchange or exercise at the initial conversion, exchange or

subscription price or rate;

(iii)

if the consideration or price determined pursuant to (i) or (ii) above (or any

component thereof) shall be expressed in a currency other than the Relevant

Currency, it shall be translated into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing

Exchange Rate on the relevant Effective Date (in the case of (i) above) or the

relevant date of first public announcement (in the case of (ii) above);

(iv)

in determining the consideration or price pursuant to the above, no deduction shall

be made for any commissions or fees (howsoever described) or any expenses

paid or incurred for any underwriting, placing or management of the issue of the

relevant Ordinary Shares or Securities or options, warrants or rights, or otherwise

in connection therewith; and

(v)

the consideration or price shall be determined as provided above on the basis of

the consideration or price received, receivable, paid or payable, regardless of

whether all or part thereof is received, receivable, paid or payable by or to the

Issuer or another entity.

(i)

Decision of an Independent Adviser

52

If any doubt shall arise as to whether an adjustment shall be made to the Floor Price or as to the appropriate adjustment to the Floor Price, the Issuer may at its discretion appoint an Independent Adviser and, following consultation between the Issuer and such Independent Adviser, a written opinion of such Independent Adviser in respect thereof shall be conclusive and binding on the Issuer and the Noteholders, save in the case of manifest error.

(j)

Share Option Schemes, Dividend Reinvestment Plans

No adjustment will be made to the Floor Price where Ordinary Shares or other Securities (including rights, warrants and options) are issued, offered, exercised, allotted, purchased, appropriated, modified or granted to, or for the benefit of, employees or former employees (including directors holding or formerly holding executive office or the personal service company of any such person) or their spouses or relatives, in each case, of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any associated company or to a trustee or trustees to be held for the benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to any share or option scheme.

(k)

Rounding Down and Notice of Adjustment to the Floor Price

On any adjustment, if the resultant Floor Price has more decimal places than the initial Floor Price, it shall be rounded to the same number of decimal places as the initial Floor Price. No adjustment shall be made to the Floor Price where such adjustment (rounded down if applicable) would be less than one per cent. of the Floor Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any amount by which the Floor Price has been rounded down, shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and such subsequent adjustment shall be made on the basis that the adjustment not required to be made had been made at the relevant time and/or, as the case may be, that the relevant rounding down had not been made.

Notice of any adjustments to the Floor Price shall be given by the Issuer to Noteholders promptly after the determination thereof in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices) and to the Paying and Conversion Agent.

The Floor Price shall not in any event be reduced to below the quota value (Sw; kvotvфrde) of an Ordinary Share for the time being. The Issuer undertakes that it shall not take any action, and shall procure that no action is taken, that would otherwise result in an adjustment to the Floor Price to below the quota value (Sw; kvotvфrde) of the Ordinary Shares immediately prior to Automatic Conversion translated into USD at the then Prevailing Exchange Rate.

6.

Redemption and Purchase

(a)

No scheduled redemption: The Notes are perpetual securities and have no fixed date for

(e)

Conditions to Redemption: Notwithstanding any other provision, the Issuer may redeem the

Notes (and give notice thereof to the Noteholders) as provided in Condition 6(b)

(Redemption for Capital Event), 6(c) (Redemption for Tax Event) or 6(d) (Redemption at the

(i)

it has obtained the prior permission of the Relevant Regulator for the redemption

of the Notes; and

(ii)

in the case of any redemption prior to the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date, (if

required by the Relevant Rules), (A) in the case of redemption upon the

occurrence of a Tax Event, the Issuer has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the

Relevant Regulator that the applicable change in tax treatment is material and

was not reasonably foreseeable as at the Issue Date, or (B) in the case

redemption upon the occurrence of a Capital Event, the Issuer has demonstrated

to the satisfaction of the Relevant Regulator that the relevant change was not

reasonably foreseeable as at the Issue Date.

(f)

Notice for redemption: any redemption of the Notes shall be subject to the Issuer providing

not less than thirty (30) days' nor more than sixty (60) days' prior notice to the Noteholders

in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices) and to the Fiscal Agent (such notice being

irrevocable except in the limited circumstances set out in Condition 6(g) (Trigger Event))

specifying the Issuer's election to redeem the Notes and the date fixed for such redemption,

provided however that where there has been a Tax Event due to the occurrence of an event

falling under limb (A) of that definition, no such notice of redemption may be given earlier

than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer would be obliged to pay any

Additional Amounts (as defined below).

(g)

Trigger Event: If:

(A)

prior to the payment of the redemption amount with respect to such redemption a

Trigger Event occurs, the relevant redemption notice shall be automatically

rescinded and shall be of no force and effect, no payment of the relevant

redemption amount will be due and payable and an Automatic Conversion shall

occur in accordance with Condition 5 (Loss Absorption Mechanism); or

(B)

the Issuer has given notice of its intention to substitute or vary the terms of the

Notes in accordance with Condition 15 (Substitution or Variation instead of

Redemption) but prior to such substitution or variation, as the case may be, a

Trigger Event occurs, the relevant substitution or variation notice shall be

automatically rescinded and shall be of no force and effect and an Automatic

54

Conversion shall occur in accordance with Condition 5 (Loss Absorption Mechanism).

(h)

No other redemption: The Issuer shall not be entitled to redeem the Notes otherwise than as

(i)

Purchase: The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may purchase Notes in the open market or

otherwise and at any price, provided that all unmatured Coupons and unexchanged Talons

force at the relevant time and to the prior permission of the Relevant Regulator (if such

permission is required by the Relevant Rules) and to applicable law and regulation.

(j)

Cancellation: Subject to all applicable laws and regulations, all Notes redeemed or

purchased by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Condition 6 and any

unmatured Coupons or unexchanged Talons attached to or surrendered with them may be

cancelled and may not be reissued or resold.

7.

Payments

(a)

Principal: Save as provided in Condition 7(c) (Payments in New York City) below, payments

of principal shall be made only against presentation and (provided that payment is made in

full) surrender of Notes at the Specified Office of any Paying Agent outside the United

States by U.S. dollar cheque drawn on, or by transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by

the payee with, a bank in New York City.

(b)

Interest. Save as provided in Condition 7(c) (Payments in New York City) below, payments

outside the United States in the manner described in Condition 7(a) (Principal) above.

(c)

Payments in New York City: Payments of principal or interest may be made at the Specified

Office of a Paying Agent in New York City if (i) the Issuer has appointed Paying Agents

outside the United States with the reasonable expectation that such Paying Agents will be

able to make payment of the full amount of the interest on the Notes in U.S. dollars when

due, (ii) payment of the full amount of such interest at the offices of all such Paying Agents

is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange controls or other similar restrictions and (iii)

payment is permitted by applicable United States law without involving in the opinion of the

Issuer, adverse tax consequences.

(d)

Payments subject to fiscal laws: All payments in respect of the Notes are subject in all

cases to any applicable fiscal or other laws and regulations in the place of payment, but

without prejudice to the provisions of Condition 9. No commissions or expenses shall be

charged to the Noteholders or Couponholders in respect of such payments.

(e)

Unmatured Coupons void: On the due date for redemption of any Note pursuant to

Condition 6(b) (Redemption for Capital Event), Condition 6(c) (Redemption for Tax Event),

Condition 6(d) (Redemption at the option of the Issuer) or Condition 10 (Winding-Up, Non

payment, Breach of Obligations, Remedies), all unmatured Coupons relating thereto

(whether or not still attached) shall become void and no payment will be made in respect

thereof.

(f)

Payments on Payment Business Days: If the due date for payment of any amount in respect

of any Note or Coupon is not a Payment Business Day in the place of presentation, the

(g)

Payments other than in respect of matured Coupons: Payments of interest other than in

respect of matured Coupons shall be made only against presentation of the relevant Notes

at the Specified Office of any Paying Agent outside the United States (or in New York City if

Coupon presented to it for payment, such Paying Agent will endorse thereon a statement

indicating the amount and the date of such payment.

(i)

Exchange of Talons: On or after the maturity date of the final Coupon which is (or was at the

time of issue) part of a coupon sheet relating to the Notes (each, a "Coupon Sheet"), the

Talon forming part of such Coupon Sheet may be exchanged at the Specified Office of the

Fiscal Agent for a further Coupon Sheet including a further Talon but excluding any

Coupons in respect of which claims have already become void pursuant to Condition

11 (Prescription). Upon the due date for redemption of any Note, any unexchanged Talon

relating to such Note shall become void and no Coupon will be delivered in respect of such

Talon.

8.

Undertakings

So long as any Note remains outstanding, the Issuer will, save with the approval of an Extraordinary Resolution:

(a)

not make any issue, grant or distribution or take or omit to take any other action if the effect

thereof would be that, upon Automatic Conversion, Conversion Shares could not, under any

applicable law then in effect, be legally issued as fully paid;

(b)

deliver Conversion Shares upon Automatic Conversion, subject to and as provided in

Condition 5 (Loss Absorption Mechanism);

(c)

use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that its issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares

and Conversion Shares, as the case may be, will be admitted to listing and trading on the

Relevant Stock Exchange;

(d)

at all times ensure there is sufficient registered authorised share capital to enable Automatic

Conversion, and all rights of subscription and exchange for Ordinary Shares, to be satisfied

in full;

(e)

as soon as reasonably practicable (and not later than one month following the occurrence of

a Trigger Event) (i) request and procure the registration of the Conversion Shares with the

SCRO, and (ii) request and procure the registration of the Conversion Shares with the

Share Registrar; and

(f)

where the provisions of Condition 5 require or provide for a determination by an

Independent Adviser or a role to be performed by a Settlement Shares Depositary, the

Issuer shall use all reasonable endeavours promptly to appoint such person for such

purpose.

9.

Taxation

All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by

56

or on behalf of the Kingdom of Sweden or any political subdivision thereof or any authority therein or thereof having power to tax, unless the withholding or deduction of such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges is required by law. In that event the Issuer shall (to the extent such payment can be made out of Distributable Items which are available mutatis mutandis in accordance with Condition 4(b)) pay in respect of payments of interest (but not principal or any other amount), such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as will result in receipt by the Noteholders after such withholding or deduction of such amounts as would have been received by them had no such withholding or deduction been required, except that no Additional Amounts shall be payable in respect of any Note:

(a)

held by a Noteholder or by a third party on behalf of a Noteholder, which is liable to such

taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges in respect of such Note by reason of

its having some connection with the Kingdom of Sweden other than the mere holding of the

Note; or

(b)

where (in the case of a payment of interest on redemption) the relevant Note is surrendered

for payment more than 30 days after the Relevant Date except to the extent that the

relevant Noteholder would have been entitled to any Additional Amounts if it had

surrendered the relevant Note on the last day of such period of 30 days; or

(c)

held by a Noteholder, or by a third party on behalf of a Noteholder who is able to avoid such

withholding or deduction by making a declaration of non-residence or residence or other

similar claim for exemption to the relevant tax authority.

If the Issuer becomes subject at any time to any taxing jurisdiction other than or in addition to the Kingdom of Sweden, references in these Conditions to the Kingdom of Sweden shall be construed as references to the Kingdom of Sweden and/or such other jurisdiction.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any amounts to be paid with respect to the Notes will be paid net of any deduction or withholding imposed or required pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, any intergovernmental agreement, or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such Sections of the Code (or any law implementing such an intergovernmental agreement) (a "FATCA Withholding Tax"), and no additional amounts shall be payable on accou nt of any FATCA Withholding Tax.

10.

Winding-Up, Non-payment, Breach of Obligations, Remedies

(a)

Winding-up: If a Winding-up Event occurs before the occurrence of a Trigger Event, the

Notes will become immediately due and payable at their principal amount, but subject to the

Noteholders only being able to claim payment in respect of the Notes in the Bankruptcy or

Liquidation of the Issuer.

A "Winding-up Event" with respect to the Notes shall result if a court in the Kingdom of Sweden shall have resolved to declare the Bankruptcy of the Issuer or if a duly convened shareholders meeting of the Issuer or the SCRO or the Relevant Regulator or a court in the Kingdom of Sweden (having jurisdiction in respect of the same) shall have declared the Issuer to enter into Liquidation or if any similar event under applicable laws from time to time having the same effect shall have occurred.

(b)

Non-payment: No interest will be due and payable if such interest has been cancelled or is

deemed cancelled (in each case, in whole or in part) as provided in Condition 4 (Interest

57

Cancellation). Accordingly, no default in payment under the Notes will have occurred or be deemed to have occurred in such circumstances.

If the Issuer fails to pay any other amount that has become due and payable under the Notes pursuant to Condition 6(b) (Redemption for Capital Event), Condition 6(c) (Redemption for Tax Event) or Condition 6(d) (Redemption at the option of the Issuer) (redemption under each such condition being subject to Condition 6(e) (Conditions to Redemption), Condition 6(f) (Notice for redemption), and Condition 6(g) (Trigger Event)) and such failure continues for fourteen (14) days, each Noteholder may, subject to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (1987:672) institute proceedings in the Kingdom of Sweden (or such other jurisdiction in which the Issuer may be organised) (but not elsewhere) for the Issuer to be declared bankrupt and/or prove or claim in the Bankruptcy or Liquidation of the Issuer.

(c)

Limited remedies for breach of obligations (other than non-payment): In addition to the

remedies for non-payment provided above, a Noteholder may institute such proceedings

against the Issuer as it may think fit to enforce any term, obligation or condition binding on

the Issuer under the Notes (other than any payment obligation of the Issuer under or arising

from the Notes, including payment of any principal or interest (including Additional Amounts)

and any damages awarded for breach of any obligations) and in no event shall the Issuer,

by virtue of the institution of any such proceedings, be obliged to pay any sum or sums, in

cash or otherwise, sooner than the same would otherwise have been payable by it pursuant

to these Conditions. The Noteholders shall not enforce, and shall not be entitled to enforce

or otherwise claim, against the Issuer any judgment or other award given in such

proceedings that requires the payment of money by the Issuer, whether by way of damages

or otherwise, except if a Winding-Up Event occurs by claiming in a Liquidation and/or

Bankruptcy of the Issuer in the circumstances provided in Condition 10(a) (Winding-up).

(d)

No other remedies: Other than the limited remedies specified in this Condition 10 or proving

in the Liquidation and/or Bankruptcy of the Issuer, no remedy against the Issuer shall be

available to the Noteholders whether for the recovery of amounts owing in respect of the

Notes or in respect of any breach by the Issuer of any of its other obligations under or in

respect of such Notes.

11.

Prescription

Claims arising, to the extent permitted, for principal shall become void unless the relevant Notes are presented for payment within ten (10) years of the appropriate Relevant Date. Claims arising, to the extent permitted, for interest shall become void unless the relevant Coupons are presented for payment within five (5) years of the appropriate Relevant Date.

12.

Replacement of Notes, Coupons and Talons

If any Note, Coupon or Talon is lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed, it may be replaced at the Specified Office of the Fiscal Agent, subject to all applicable laws and stock exchange requirements, upon payment by the claimant of the expenses incurred in connection with such replacement and on such terms as to evidence, security, indemnity and otherwise as the Issuer may reasonably require. Mutilated or defaced Notes, Coupons or Talons must be surrendered before replacements will be issued.

13.

Paying Agents

In acting under the Agency Agreement and in connection with the Notes and the Coupons, the Paying Agents, the Paying and Conversion Agent and the Calculation Agent act solely as agents of the

58

Issuer and do not assume any obligations towards or relationship of agency or trust for or with any of the Noteholders or Couponholders.

The initial Paying Agents and their initial Specified Offices are listed in the Agency Agreement. The Issuer reserves the right at any time to vary or terminate the appointment of any Paying Agent, the Paying and Conversion Agent or the Calculation Agent and to appoint a successor fiscal agent, paying and conversion agent, calculation agent and additional or successor paying agents; provided, however, that the Issuer shall at all times maintain a fiscal agent, a paying and conversion agent and a calculation agent.

Notice of any change in any of the Paying Agents, the Paying and Conversion Agent or the Calculation Agent or in their Specified Offices shall promptly be given to the Noteholders.

14.

Meetings of Noteholders; Modification

(a)

Meetings of Noteholders: The Agency Agreement contains provisions for convening

meetings of Noteholders to consider matters relating to the Notes, including the modification

of any provision of these Conditions. Any such modification may be made if sanctioned by

an Extraordinary Resolution. Such a meeting may be convened by the Issuer and shall be

convened by it upon the request in writing of Noteholders holding not less than one-tenth of

the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. The quorum at any meeting

convened to vote on an Extraordinary Resolution will be one or more persons holding or

representing not less than 50 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding

Notes or, at any adjourned meeting, one or more persons being or representing

Noteholders whatever the principal amount of the Notes held or represented; provided,

however, that certain proposals (including any proposal to change any interest payment

date in respect of the Notes, to reduce the amount of principal or interest payable on any

date in respect of the Notes, to alter the method of calculating the amount of any payment in

respect of the Notes or the date for any such payment, to change the currency of payments

under the Notes, to change the quorum requirements relating to meetings or the majority

required to pass an Extraordinary Resolution and to modify any provisions of Condition 5

(Loss Absorption Mechanism) (each, a "Reserved Matter")) may only be sanctioned by an

Extraordinary Resolution passed at a meeting of Noteholders at which one or more persons

holding or representing not less than three-quarters or, at any adjourned meeting, half of the

aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes form a quorum. Any Extraordinary

Resolution duly passed at any such meeting shall be binding on all the Noteholders,

whether present or not.

In addition, a resolution in writing signed by or on behalf of all Noteholders who for the time being are entitled to receive notice of a meeting of Noteholders will take effect as if it were an Extraordinary Resolution. Such a resolution in writing may be contained in one document or several documents in the same form, each signed by or on behalf of one or more Noteholders.

(b)

Modification: Subject to Condition 14(c) (Relevant Regulator notice or permission), the

Notes and these Conditions may be amended without the consent of the Noteholders or the

Couponholders to correct a manifest error. In addition, the parties to the Agency Agreement

may agree to modify any provision thereof, but the Issuer shall not agree without the

consent of the Noteholders to any such modification unless it is of a formal, minor or

technical nature, it is made to correct a manifest error or it is, in the opinion of such parties,

not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders.

(c)

Relevant Regulator notice or permission: These Conditions shall only be capable of

Summary of Provisions Relating to the Notes while in Global Form

Words and expressions defined in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes" herein shall have the same meanings in this "Summary of the Provisions relating to the Notes while in Global Form".

The following is a summary of the provisions to be contained in the Temporary Global Note and the Permanent Global Note (together, the "Global Notes") which will apply to, and in some cases modify, the Terms and Conditions of the Notes while the Notes are represented by the Global Notes.

1.

Exchange

The Notes will initially be in the form of the Temporary Global Note which will be deposited on or around the Issue Date with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Interests in the Temporary Global Note will be exchangeable, in whole or in part, for interests in the Permanent Global Note (which will also be deposited on or around the Issue Date with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg) on or after the Exchange Date, upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership. Interest payments in respect of the Notes cannot be collected without such certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership.

Whenever any interest in the Temporary Global Note is to be exchanged for an interest in the Permanent Global Note, the Issuer shall procure (in the case of first exchange) the prompt delivery (free of charge to the bearer) of the Permanent Global Note, duly authenticated, to the bearer of the Temporary Global Note or (in the case of any subsequent exchange of a part of the Temporary Global Note) an increase in the principal amount of the Permanent Global Note in accordance with its terms against:

(i)

presentation and (in the case of final exchange) surrender of the Temporary Global Note to

or to the order of the Fiscal Agent; and

(ii)

in either case, receipt by the Fiscal Agent of a certificate or certificates of non-U.S.

beneficial ownership,

within seven days of the bearer requesting such exchange.

The Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder) for definitive Notes only:

(a)

if an event as set out in Condition 10 (Winding-Up, Non-payment, Breach of Obligations,

Remedies) has occurred and is continuing;

(b)

if either of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other clearing system by which the

Notes have been accepted for clearing is closed for business for a continuous period of 14

days (other than by reason of legal holidays) or announces an intention to cease business

permanently; or

(c)

at the option of the Issuer if the Issuer or any Paying Agent, by reason of any change in, or

amendment to, Swedish law, is or will be required to make any deduction or withholding

from any payment under the Notes which would not be required if such Notes were in

definitive form.

Thereupon (in the case of (a) and (b) above) the holder of the Permanent Global Note (acting on the instructions of one or more of the Accountholders (as defined below)) may give notice to the Issuer and (in the case of (c) above) the Issuer may give notice to the Fiscal Agent and the Noteholders, of

74

its intention to exchange the Permanent Global Note for definitive Notes on or after the Exchange Date (as defined below).

On or after the Exchange Date the holder of the Permanent Global Note may or, in the case of (c) above, shall surrender the Permanent Global Note to or to the order of the Fiscal Agent. In exchange for the Permanent Global Note the Issuer will deliver, or procure the delivery of, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (having attached to them all Coupons in respect of interest which has not already been paid on the Permanent Global Note), security printed in accordance with any applicable legal and stock exchange requirements and in or substantially in the form set out in the Agency Agreement. On exchange of the Permanent Global Note, the Issuer will procure that it is cancelled and, if the holder so requests, returned to the holder together with any relevant definitive Notes.

For these purposes, "Exchange Date" means a day specified in the notice requiring exchange falling not less than 45 days after that on which such notice is given and being a day on which banks are open for general business in the place in which the specified office of the Fiscal Agent is located and, except in the case of exchange pursuant to (b) above, in the place in which the relevant clearing system is located.

2.

Payments

On and after 26 January 2017, no payment will be made on the Temporary Global Note unless exchange for an interest in the Permanent Global Note is improperly withheld or refused. Payments of principal and interest in respect of Notes represented by a Global Note will, subject as set out below, be made against presentation for endorsement and, if no further payment falls to be made in respect of the Notes, surrender of such Global Note to the order of the Fiscal Agent or such other Paying Agent as shall have been notified to the Noteholders for such purposes. A record of each payment made will be endorsed on the appropriate part of the schedule to the relevant Global Note by or on behalf of the Fiscal Agent, which endorsement shall be prima facie evidence that such payment has been made in respect of the Notes. Payments of interest on the Temporary Global Note (if permitted by the first sentence of this paragraph) will be made only upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership unless such certification has already been made.

3.

Notices

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global Note(s) is/are held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, notices to Noteholders may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be) for communication to the relative Accountholders (as defined below) rather than by publication as required by Condition 17 (Notices), provided that the Issuer shall also ensure that notices are duly published in a manner which complies with the rules and regulations of any stock exchange or the relevant authority on which the Notes are for the time being listed. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the Noteholders on the second day after the day on which such notice is delivered to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be) as aforesaid.

For the purposes of Condition 5(b) (Automatic Conversion Procedure), the Automatic Conversion Notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date on which such notice is delivered to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg.

Whilst any of the Notes held by a Noteholder are represented by a Global Note, notices to be given by such Noteholder may be given by such Noteholder (where applicable) through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and otherwise in such manner as the Fiscal Agent and Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may approve for this purpose.

75

4.

Accountholders

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global Note(s) is/are held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, each person (other than Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg) who is for the time being shown in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a particular principal amount of such Notes (each an "Accountholder") (in which regard any certificate or other document issued by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as to the principal amount of such Notes standing to the account of any person shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes) shall be treated as the holder of such principal amount of such Notes for all purposes (including but not limited to, for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, meetings of the Noteholders and giving notices to the Issuer pursuant to Condition 10 (Winding-Up, Non-payment, Breach of Obligations, Remedies)) other than with respect to the payment of principal and interest on such principal amount of such Notes, the right to which shall be vested, as against the Issuer, solely in the bearer of the relevant Global Note in accordance with and subject to its terms. Each Accountholder must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, for its share of each payment made to the bearer of the relevant Global Note.

5.

Prescription

Claims against the Issuer in respect of principal and interest on the Notes represented by a Global Note will be prescribed after ten years (in the case of principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the Relevant Date (as defined in Condition 19 (Interpretation)).

6.

Cancellation

Cancellation of any Note represented by a Global Note and required by the Terms and Conditions of the Notes to be cancelled following its redemption or purchase will be effected by endorsement by or on behalf of the Fiscal Agent of the reduction in the principal amount of the relevant Global Note on the relevant part of the schedule thereto.

7.

Delivery Notices

Notwithstanding the provisions of Condition 5 (Loss Absorption Mechanism), if the Notes are represented by the Global Note and held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, the Noteholder shall give a Delivery Notice to the Settlement Shares Depositary in accordance with the standard procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg prior to the Notice Cut-off Date (which may include notice being given on its instruction by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any common depositary for them to the Settlement Shares Depositary by electronic means) in a form acceptable to Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg from time to time with the following details: (1) the name of the Noteholder; (2) the principal amount of Notes held by it; (3) the Euroclear Sweden account details; and (4) such other details as Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg may require. Any reference in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes to the delivery of Delivery Notices shall be construed accordingly.

Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg

Notes represented by a Global Note are transferable in accordance with the rules and procedures for the time being of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, as appropriate.

7.1

Overview

Swedbank is a public limited liability bank company (Sw: Bankaktiebolag) incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Sweden and headquartered in Stockholm. It has its registered address at SE-105 34 Stockholm, with its head office at Landsvфgen 40, 172 63 Sundbyberg and its telephone number is +46 (0)8 5859 0000. It has been registered in the Swedish Companies Registration Office in Sundsvall under registration number 502017-7753. Swedbank's shares are listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. Swedbank was incorporated on 24 April 1942. Swedbank operates under the Swedish Banking and Financing Business Act (2004:297).

As of 31 December 2015, the Swedbank Group served a total of 7.2 million private customers and more than 600,000 corporate customers through more than 420 branches in 11 countries, primarily in its principal markets of Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. This includes customers reached through 58 associated independent savings banks that collaborate with Swedbank.

The terms of such collaboration are governed by a common framework agreement which is agreed with the national association of savings banks, Sparbankernas RiksfЎrbund, with each savings bank having signed up to this agreement individually.

As set out in Article 1 of its Articles of Association, the purpose of the Issuer is to conduct banking business and financing operations, and operations naturally connected therewith. The Swedbank Group offers a broad range of products and services, including retail banking, corporate and investment banking, asset management and insurance products, and the majority of the Swedbank Group's income in 2015 derived from its Swedish banking services. As of 31 December 2015, the Swedbank Group's loans to the public, excluding the Swedish National Debt Office and repurchase agreements, amounted to SEK 1,371 billion. The Swedbank Group recorded SEK 21,291 million in profit before impairments for the year ended 31 December 2015. As of 31 December 2015, the Swedbank Group had 13,893 full- time employees.

The Swedbank Group has a history dating back to 1820 when the first savings bank was founded in Sweden. In the early 1990s, each of Sparbanken Sverige and Foreningsbanken was merged with a number of regional savings banks and regional agricultural co-operative banks, respectively. In 1997, Sparbanken Sverige and Foreningsbanken merged to form ForeningsSparbanken. ForeningsSparbanken changed its name to Swedbank in 2006. Swedbank expanded its operations into the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) in 1996 when it acquired a 12.5 per cent stake in Eesti Hoiupank, a bank that merged with Hansabank in 1998. In 1999, Swedbank acquired additional shares, resulting in a 50 per cent ownership of the shares in Hansabank and, in 2005, acquired all outstanding shares in Hansabank (now Swedbank AS). The Swedbank Group consists of four business segments: Swedish Banking, Baltic Banking, Large Corporates & Institutions and Group Functions & Other. Swedbank's funding strategy is based on the structure of its assets. More than half of its lending consists of Swedish mortgages, which are primarily financed through covered bonds. Swedbank is one of the leading savings banks in its home markets. Deposit volumes, together with covered bonds and shareholder equity, nearly cover Swedbank's total funding requirements. Therefore, Swedbank has a limited structural need for senior unsecured funding. Swedbank's funding strategy is also closely linked to the credit quality of the assets on its balance sheet. One of Swedbank's areas of focus for managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it maintains high quality lending activities. Swedbank strives to match unsecured funding against assets of an equivalent amount and maturity. The Swedbank Group's share of unsecured funding is mainly determined by regulatory requirements, its liquidity needs and the buffer it wants to maintain in its cover pool in the form of overcollateralisation in order to withstand fluctuations in housing prices. The Swedbank Group has a well-diversified investor base. The below tables show funding issuance from Q1 2012 to Q3 2016. SEKbn

7.3

Strategy

Swedbank's core strategy is to provide customer value and build sustainable value. By being a stable profitable bank with low risk, Swedbank is able to build relationships that meet its customers' long-term needs. The aim of its strategy is to create sustainable value for its customers, society, its shareholders and its employees. Swedbank has chosen to create long-term customer and shareholder value. This goal reflects Swedbank's purpose, values and vision.

7.3.1 Accessible Full-Service Bank

Swedbank offers households, institutions, and businesses, both large and small, an accessible full-service bank in its four home markets: Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Swedbank offers its customers a range of

80

banking services, from basic transaction services, sophisticated advisory services, and also provides customers with a large, modern distribution network, making it easy for a broad base of customers to manage their finances. Swedbank provides efficient digital solutions for day-to-day financial needs and comprehensive advice through direct contact with Swedbank employees.

7.3.2 Products and Services Based on Customer Needs

Products which reflect customer needs and expectations are crucial to Swedbank's success. Digitisation increases opportunities to meet each customer's specific needs with the right products and services. Swedbank creates better targeted products and services by analysing customer data and using each advisor's experiences and knowledge.

7.3.3 Low Risk

The foundation for Swedbank's sustainable growth is a low risk profile. Swedbank's lending is financed through deposits and capital markets funding. Current low financing costs are the result of stable profitability in combination with high-quality lending and solid capitalisation. A low risk profile benefits all of Swedbank's stakeholders. Maintaining stable earnings requires a low risk level, where each borrower's solvency, solidity and collateral are carefully assessed, as well as the ability to quickly adapt to market conditions and changing customer preferences. The Group's credit impairments amounted to SEK 594 million corresponding to a credit impairment ratio of 0.04 per cent for the year ended 31 December 2015, compared to a credit impairment of SEK 419 million, corresponding to a credit impairment ratio of 0.03 per cent for the year ended 31 December 2014.

7.3.4 Cost Efficiency

Cost efficiency is of growing importance due to changes in the banking market and Swedbank aims to be a market leader in cost efficiency. Swedbank aims to understand its customers' needs and the impact of tied-up capital, in order to better manage capital efficiency. Swedbank also promotes an efficient corporate culture where all employees are aware of and cautious about expenses. The more cost-effective Swedbank is, the more value it believes it can create for customers through greater investment opportunities. The Group's cost/income ratio was 0.43 for the year ended 31 December 2015, 0.45 for the year ended 31 December 2014 and 0.45 for the year ended 31 December 2013.

7.4

Business Segments

The Swedbank Group consists of four business segments.

7.4.1 Swedish Banking

Swedish Banking is the Swedbank Group's largest business segment, offering a complete range of financial products and services to private customers as well as small and medium-sized companies through 275 branches as well as through telephone and internet banking.

7.4.4 Group Functions & Other

Group Functions & Other consists of centralised business support units and Group Products. The centralised business support units provide strategic and administrative support, comprising Accounting & Finance, Communication, Risk, IT, Compliance, Public Affairs, Human Resources and Legal.

Products and Services

7.5.1 Mortgage Lending Products

The products offered primarily consist of loans secured by mortgages over underlying residential, agricultural and forest properties. Consumer real estate loans include fixed and variable rate loans for home purchase and refinancing needs.

The Swedbank Group, through Swedbank Mortgage, is one of Sweden's leading mortgage lenders with a 1
market share of 25 per cent as of 31 December 2015 and as of 31 December 2014.

Both Swedbank and Swedbank Mortgage originate mortgages. Swedbank Mortgage is responsible for the origination of standard mortgage loans with up to an 85 per cent loan to value ratio, whereas Swedbank is responsible for originating other loans including uncollateralised loans. To benefit customers by offering a broad range of home buying services and reducing costs, while creating the opportunity to acquire profitable new businesses in this segment, the Swedbank Group creates economies of scale by co-operating with a number of partners including Swedbank's subsidiary, Swedbank Fastighetsbyra, various home builders and other construction companies.

Swedbank Mortgage's products primarily consist of loans secured by Swedish residential, agricultural and forestry.

Swedbank Mortgage lends exclusively in Sweden and primarily provides long-term loans secured by first ranking mortgages on existing properties. More than half of Swedbank Mortgage's mortgage loan portfolio consists of loans to owners of single-family homes. It also grants loans for tenant owner rights, multi-family housing, tenant-owner associations, municipalities, commercial properties and to the agriculture and forestry sector.

Loans for single-family homes are primarily secured by first ranking mortgages and have interest rates fixed for between 60 days and 10 years. Swedbank Mortgage's loans are either interest-only loans or amortised over 10

82

to 60 years. Swedbank Mortgage's lending to single-family housing is limited to 85 per cent of the market value of the property. Loans may be granted to applicants who have a prior ranking mortgage over their property with another lender, provided that the aggregated amount and ranking of the prior ranking mortgage and the Swedbank Group's own exposure under its mortgage is less than 85 per cent of the value of the mortgaged property.

7.5.2 Corporate Banking Products

The Swedbank Group offers a full range of corporate banking products and services for small and medium sized business clients and large and multinational corporate customers, including financing, cash management, leasing products, investment and risk-management services.

Below is a chart showing Swedbank's corporate structure.

7.6.1 Sweden
The banking sector is fairly concentrated in the Swedbank Group's home markets. In Sweden, the Swedbank Group, Svenska Handelsbanken, Nordea and SEB accounted for approximately 70 per cent of deposits and lending in 2015, according to the Swedish Central Bank (Sw; Riksbanken). These major banks offer a wide range of financial products and services and compete in all key product segments. In Sweden, the Swedbank Group is the largest retail bank and has a leading market position in private mortgage lending (25 per cent) and deposits from private customers (21 per cent) as of 31 December 2015. 2
The Swedbank Group believes consumers have been more willing to change banks in recent years in a generally stable market. During the past year, banking customers have shown a tendency to turn to the major banks due to perceived volatility among smaller players.
7.6.2 Estonia
The Estonian banking sector is even more concentrated than Sweden's. The market is dominated by foreign banks. In Estonia, the Swedbank Group had a market share of 55 per cent for deposits and private customers and 47 per cent for lending as of 31 December 2015. In the Estonian corporate market, the Swedbank Group's
3
share was 34 per cent for lending and 41 per cent for deposits as of 31 December 2015.
7.6.3 Latvia
Latvia has a more fragmented market where local banks account for 30 to 70 per cent of the various segments. As of 31 December 2015, the Swedbank Group accounted for 28 per cent of private deposits and 29 per cent of private lending. In the corporate market, the market share was 12 per cent for deposits as of 31 December 2015. 342

7.6.4 Lithuania
Like Sweden, the banking market in Lithuania is dominated by a few major players. As of 31 December 2015, the Swedbank Group accounted for 38 per cent of private deposits and 28 per cent of private lending. In the corporate market, the Swedbank Group's share was 20 per cent for lending and 22 per cent. for deposits as of 31 December 2015. In all the Baltic countries, competition has begun to increase again as the economy appears to recover.

Risk Management

Swedbank defines risk as a potential negative impact on the value of the Group that may arise from current internal processes or from internal or external future events. The concept of risk combines the probability of an event occurring with the impact that such an event would have on profit and loss, equity and the value of the Group.

Risk arises in all financial operations, and managing it well is central for success. A strong common risk culture within Swedbank, with decision-making and responsibility kept close to the customer, serves as the foundation for efficient risk management and, consequently, a strong risk-adjusted return.

The Board has the ultimate responsibility for the Group's risk-taking and capital assessment. Through an Enterprise Risk Management Policy ("ERM Policy"), the Board provides guidelines for the CEO on risk management and risk control, and how these functions should support the business strategy. The ERM Policy specifies the risk appetite, the concept of three lines of defence, the fundamental principles of risk management, as well as roles and responsibilities.

8.1

The Group's Risk Management Builds on Three Lines of Defence

Successful risk management requires a strong risk culture and a common approach throughout the entire Group. Swedbank builds its approach to risk management on the concept of three lines of defence, signifying a clear division of responsibilities between the risk owner, i.e. the business units, the control functions consisting of Group Risk, Group Compliance and Internal Audit.

Swedbank's risk management
Swedbank's risk management is built on a sophisticated risk process w ith three lines of defence.

First line of defence

Second line of defence

Risk management by business operations
Swedbank's business unitsand subsidiaries bearfull responsibility fo r the risks th a t arise in th e ir operations, Their employees have the best understanding o f the customer and specific market. The customer's cash flow, solidity and collateral are always th e deci sive factors in the loan approval process. Standardised risk classification tools are in place to support the lending process.

Independent risk control
The risk organisation is independent o f the business operations and is responsiblefor identification, quantification, analysis and reporting o f all risks. It upholds principles and fram eworks fo r risk management to facilitate risk assessments. The credit risk function issues internal lendingguidelines, such as cash flo w and collateral require ments fo r customers as well as ma ndate stru ctu re s fo r credit decisions w ithin the organisation. For loans exceeding certain levels, th e decisions are taken in cre dit com m ittees to create a duality w ith th e business operations. The com m ittees also promote a sound risk culture by supporting and training employees in the business areas.

Internal Audit, an independent review func tion directly subordinate to the Board of Directors, conducts reviews of the firs t and second lines o f defence, It identifies potential improvements in operations by evaluating risk management, governance and internal control. Internal Audit hasalso been tasked w ith identifying and helping to minimise activities th a t do not add value. When flaws are identified, the operations in question, in consultation w ith Internal Audit, formulate an action plan th a t clearly defines responsi bilities and sets a timetable. The agreedupon actions are followed up, and Internal Audit reports on their status to the Board of Directorsand executive management on a quarterly basis until the w ork is completed.

8.2

Three levels of risk management

8.2.1 First Line of Defence - Risk Management by Business Operations

Each of Swedbank's business units and subsidiaries bear full responsibility for the risks that arise within their respective operations where employees have the best understanding of their customers and specific markets.

A customer's cash flow, solvency and collateral are always the decisive factors in the loan approval process and standardised risk classification tools are supporting and facilitating the lending process.

During 2013, dedicated efforts were made to improve overall governance and control in relation to operating risks. This was primarily done through strengthening risk management capabilities in the first line of defence.

8.2.2 Second Line of Defence - Risk and Control Functions

Group Risk is independent of the Group's business operations and is responsible for the identification, quantification, analysis and reporting of all material risks. It upholds principles and the risk management framework in order to facilitate risk assessments. Group Risk is also responsible for providing operational guidance and support to the business organisation by promoting a sound risk culture within the Group.

Group Risk issues internal lending guidelines, such as cash flow and collateral requirements for customers, as well as structures used in making credit decisions within the organisation. For loans exceeding a certain level, decisions are also taken by credit committees, separately from the business organisation, in order to ensure prudent decision-making. Such committees also promote a sound risk culture by supporting and training employees in the business organisation.

8.2.3 Third Line of Defence - Internal Audit

Internal Audit, an independent review function reporting directly to the Board of Directors, conducts reviews of the first and second lines of defence. It identifies potential improvements in operations by evaluating risk management, governance and internal controls. Internal Audit has also been tasked with identifying and helping to minimise activities that do not create value.

When flaws are identified, the operations in question, in consultation with Internal Audit, formulate an action plan that clearly defines responsibilities and sets a timetable for implementing such action plan. The agreedupon plan is implemented and Internal Audit reports on its status to the Board of Directors and executive management on a quarterly basis until the work is complete.

9.1.1 Basel 3 capital requirements (Pillar 1)

The CET1 capital ratio according to Basel 3 (fully phased-in), i.e. the CET1 capital in relation to the risk exposure amount ("REA") was 24.1 per cent at the end of 2015 (21.2 per cent. at 31 December 2014) and 23.8 per cent. at 30 September 2016.

CET1 capital increased by 6.0 billion, to SEK 93.9 billion as at 31 December 2015. The change is mainly attributable to earnings, net of proposed dividend. The accounting for employee benefits (IAS 19) creates volatility in the estimated pension liabilities and increased the CET1 capital by approximately SEK 2.8bn during 2015. As at 30 September 2016, CET1 capital was SEK 96.0 billion.

The REA decreased during 2015 to SEK 389.1 billion (SEK 414.2 billion as of 31 December 2014). As at 30 September 2016, REA was SEK 403.7 billion.

Credit risk REA decreased by SEK 20.7 billion during 2015. In terms of exposures, there was an increase in corporate and private mortgage exposures in Swedish Banking and LC&I, but the effect was counteracted by decreased exposures to credit institutions and Russia and reduced balance-sheet items which decreased the

94

credit risk REA. Positive rating migrations, both in the PD and the LGD dimension, reduced REA. Updated PD models within Baltic Banking reduced REA. Fluctuations in exchange rates, mainly attributable to the Baltic credit portfolio, decreased the REA for credit risk. Credit risk REA was SEK 323.0 billion as at 30 September 2016. The REA for credit valuation adjustment (CVA risk) increased by SEK 0.2 billion. The REA for market risk decreased by SEK 8.3 billion, mainly due to decreased interest rates and FX risk, and due to the Swedish FSA's approval of the modification of one of Swedbank's valuation models to adapt to negative inter est rates. The REA for operational risks increased by SEK 3.8 billion compared with the preceding year-end, mainly due to Swedbank's revenue being higher in 2014 than in 2011. This affected the capital requirement for operational risk, which is calculated based on a rolling three-year average of revenues. In 2016, REA for operational risks decreased by SEK 0.9bn due to the annually updated calculation.
9.1.2 Swedish Capital Requirements regulation The Swedish FSA has imposed capital requirements beyond the minimum level of 7 per cent CET1 capital (including the mandatory capital conservation buffer of 2.5 per cent) to Swedish banks, in accordance with EU rules. The four major Swedish banks, including Swedbank, are required to maintain a systemic risk buffer of 3 per cent in CET1 capital within the framework of Pillar 1 and a further 2 per cent within the framework of Pillar 2. The countercyclical buffer for Swedish exposures has been 1.5 per cent since 27 June 2016. In March 2016, the Swedish FSA decided to increase the countercyclical buffer rate for Swedish exposures to 2.0 per cent, effective 19 March 2017. Due to the risk weight floor for the Swedish mortgage portfolio of 25 per cent, Swedbank has as of 30 September 2016 to maintain additional CET1 capital of SEK 25.5 billion for Swedish mortgages within the framework of Pillar 2 corresponding to 6.3 per cent REA. In its internal controls Swedbank allocates capital to its mortgage business equivalent to a 25 per cent risk weight floor. In September 2016, the Swedish FSA completed its supervisory review and evaluation process ("SREP") for 2016 for Swedbank. In the course of the SREP, the Swedish FSA applied the revised requirements it adopted in May 2016 for Swedish banks calculating risk weights for capital requirements using the internal ratings-based approach, especially with regard to corporate exposures, which increased Swedbank's CET1 capital requirement for individual Pillar 2 risks by 0.7 per cent. Swedbank's total CET1 capital requirement for individual Pillar 2 risks is estimated at 2.0 per cent.

The capital requirement for Swedbank, calculated as 31 December 2015 based on information that was current at that time, was equivalent to a CET1 capital ratio of 19.9 per cent. That requirement took into account Swedbank's Common Equity Tier 1 capital requirement for individual Pillar 2 risks of 0.9 per cent as of that time as well as all increases in countercyclical buffer values that had been announced at that time, such as the increase in the Swedish countercyclical buffer value to 1.5 per cent in June 2016. Swedbank's actual CET1 ratio at the end of 2015 was 24.1 per cent. The capital requirement for Swedbank, calculated as at 30 September 2016, was equivalent to a CET1 capital ratio of 21.6 per cent. That requirement took into account Swedbank's Common Equity Tier 1 capital requirement for individual Pillar 2 risks of 2.0 per cent as well as all increases in countercyclical buffer values that have been announced, such as the increase in the Swedish countercyclical buffer value to 2.0 per cent in March 2017. Swedbank's actual CET1 capital ratio as at 30 September 2016 was 23.8 per cent. This means that there is an adequate buffer above the fully implemented capital requirement to manage volatilities in capital and REA already in place.

11 Description o f the Shares
Form and denomination
Under its Articles of Association, as presently adopted, there is only one class of shares, (the "Shares") in the capital of the Issuer. The Shares are denominated in SEK and their quota value is SEK 22 per share as at the date of this Offering Circular.
The Shares are issued in electronic form and presently registered in the electronic securities system of Euroclear Sweden AB which also maintains the Issuer's share register. No share certificates are issued with respect to the Shares. The address of Euroclear Sweden AB is Box 191, SE-10123 Stockholm, Sweden.
The Shares have been issued, and any new Shares will be issued, in accordance with Swedish law. The rights associated with the Shares that are set forth in the Articles of Association of the Issuer, can only be changed in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Swedish Companies Act (Sw: aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)), the Swedish Banking and Financing Business Act (Sw; lagen (2004:297) om bank- och finansieringsrorelse) and the Swedish Resolution Act (Sw: lagen (2015:1016) om resolution). Furthermore any amendments to the Issuer's Articles of Association will be subject to the approval of the Swedish FSA.
Supervisory approval for certain acquisitions of Shares
Under Swedish law, direct or indirect acquisitions of Shares require approval from the Swedish FSA when resulting in a qualified holding. A holding is qualified if it amounts to 10 per cent. or more of the capital or of all the voting rights in the Issuer or otherwise renders it possible to exercise a significant influence over the management of the Issuer. Approval is also required each time a qualified holding increases so that it amounts to or exceeds 20, 30 or 50 per cent. of the capital or of all voting rights in the Issuer or such that it causes the Issuer to become a subsidiary pursuant to Swedish law. These rules apply to purchases as well as other methods of acquiring Shares, for example conversion of the Notes into Shares. If approval is granted by the Swedish FSA, the direct or indirect shareholder will have continuous obligations in respect of its holding, among others a requirement to notify the Swedish FSA about changes in its holding of Shares and changes in its management. Also, the Swedish FSA may order the shareholder to sell all or part of its Shares.
Non-compliance with such disclosure and/or approval requirements may lead to the incurrence by the
Noteholder of substantial fines and/or suspension of voting rights associated with the Shares.
Reporting requirements at certain levels of shareholding
As long as the Shares are listed on a regulated market in the EEA anyone acquiring or disposing of Shares must report its holding to the Issuer and to the Swedish FSA each time the number of Shares or voting rights of that shareholder reaches, exceeds or falls below 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 66 2/3 or 90 per cent. This applies regardless of whether the shareholder has acquired the Shares by way of a conversion of the Notes or in any other way. When calculating the number of Shares or voting rights the shareholder must include Shares held by certain other related persons or entities as further detailed in Swedish legislation.
Non-compliance with such disclosure and/or approval requirements may lead to the incurrence by the Noteholder of substantial fines and/or suspension of voting rights associated with the Shares.
Mandatory bids
A holder of less than 30 per cent. of the voting rights of the Issuer (or someone holding no voting rights) who acquires enough Shares such that its total holding amounts to at least 30 per cent. of the voting rights of the Issuer is obliged pursuant to the Swedish Stock Market (Takeover Bids) Act (2006:451) (as amended or replaced from time to time) implementing Directive 2004/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
98

to publish immediately the size of its holding (together with those of related parties) and, no later than four weeks thereafter, make a public offering for the remaining outstanding Shares.
Right to attend general meetings of shareholders
At general meetings of shareholders each Share carries one vote. Each shareholder is entitled to participate in general meetings and vote for the full number of Shares held by such shareholder. A shareholder is entitled to bring not more than two assistants and to be represented by proxy. on a general meeting of shareholders. A shareholder who wishes to attend a general meeting and vote for its Shares must be registered in the share register of the Issuer on the record date determined for such purpose. Notices convening general meetings shall be made by public notice in Post och Inrikes Tidningar (the Swedish Official Gazette) and by way of the notice being made available on the Issuer's web site. Information that the notice has been issued shall be made public in the Swedish daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter at the time of the notice. Notice of a general meeting must not be made earlier than 6 weeks prior to the date of the meeting and no later than 3 or in some cases 4 weeks before the date of the meeting.
Resolutions of general meetings of shareholders can usually be made by a majority of more than 50 per cent. of the votes cast but in some cases higher majority requirements apply, in particular if the rights of shareholders will be affected.
Notices of general meetings of the Issuer are given in the manner described above.
Pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act, at general meetings of the Issuer the Board of Directors and the CEO are under a duty to, upon request by any shareholder and where the Board of Directors believes that such may take place without material damage to the Issuer and without any appreciable inconvenience to any person, provide information regarding any circumstances which may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda or of the Issuer's financial situation (the latter normally only at the annual general meeting). Such duty to provide information applies also to the Issuer's relation to other group companies, the consolidated accounts and such circumstances regarding subsidiaries as specified in the foregoing sentence.
Right to receive dividends
Any declaration of dividends under Swedish law must be adopted by the general meeting. Dividends may only be declared to the extent there are distributable funds in the Issuer and to the extent that such declaration is prudent taking into consideration the demands, with respect to size of shareholders' equity, which are imposed by the nature, scope and risks associated with operations and the Issuer's need to strengthen its balance sheet, liquidity and financial position. The shareholders may not, as a general rule, declare higher dividends than the Board of Directors has proposed or approved.
Shareholders owning in aggregate a tenth of all outstanding Shares have the right to demand payment of dividends from the profits of the Issuer. Following such request, the Annual General Meeting shall resolve upon the distribution of one-half of the remaining profit for the year pursuant to the adopted balance sheet after certain deductions have been made. The general meeting is not, however, obliged to resolve upon dividends in excess of 5 per cent. of the Issuer's shareholders' equity. Further, the general meeting may never declare dividends in excess of distributable funds nor in violation of the prudence rule described above.
Dividends are normally paid in cash but may also be paid in kind. Persons registered as owners of the Shares in the share register on the record date established by the general meeting will be entitled to receive dividends.
99

Neither the Swedish Companies Act nor the Issuer's Articles of Association contain any restrictions regarding the dividend rights of shareholders resident outside Sweden. With the exception of any restrictions pursuant to the bank and clearing system, payment to such shareholders is executed in the same manner as for shareholders resident in Sweden. However, shareholders with a tax domicile outside Sweden are normally subject to Swedish withholding tax. See "Taxation - Sweden Taxation".
Preferential rights in case of new share issues
In the event that the Issuer resolves to issue new Shares, whether in a cash issue or an issue where the new Shares shall be paid for by way of set-off, all shareholders will typically have preferential rights to the new Shares in relation to the number of Shares held in the Issuer. For details of circumstances in which there will be an adjustment to the Floor Price in connection with any Automatic Conversion, please see the "Terms and Conditions of the Notes". For the avoidance of doubt, any new Shares issued pursuant to the conversion of the Notes (in accordance with their terms) will not be subject to the preferential rights of the shareholders mentioned above.
Share repurchases by the Issuer
Since the Shares are listed on a regulated market, the Swedish Companies Act allows the Issuer to repurchase Shares in a total number not exceeding 10 per cent. of the outstanding shares, either by purchasing them on a regulated market or by way of a public offering. Any decision by the Issuer to repurchase Shares must be made by a general meeting of shareholders or by the board of directors following a mandate given by a general meeting of shareholders, in both cases requiring a majority of at least 2/3 of the votes cast as well as of the Shares represented at the meeting.
Information to shareholders
The Issuer normally discloses information to its shareholders by publication of press releases and/or by making the information available on its website.
Compulsory acquisition proceedings
Pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act, a shareholder that directly or indirectly holds more than 90 per cent. of the Shares is entitled to acquire the other shareholders' Shares and each minority shareholder is entitled to require such majority shareholder to acquire its Shares. A majority shareholder that exercises such right to acquire the outstanding Shares in the Issuer is also entitled to acquire any convertibles (including the Notes) or warrants issued by the Issuer. Each holder of such convertibles or warrants (including the Noteholders) is entitled to require the majority shareholder to acquire its convertibles (including the Notes) or warrants notwithstanding that the majority shareholder does not exercise its right to acquire the outstanding Shares. If an agreement on the purchase price cannot be reached between the parties, the purchase price shall be determined through arbitration and generally be the price which could be expected in a sale under normal circumstances. A shareholder or a holder of a convertible or a warrant who does not participate in the arbitration will be represented by a trustee appointed by the Swedish Companies Registration Office.
Transfers of Shares
A transfer of Shares must be registered in the electronic securities system of Euroclear Sweden AB to give the transferee shareholder rights in relation to the Issuer. Transfers are usually made through one or more financial intermediaries such as banks, stockbrokers etc. who are connected to Euroclear Sweden AB and may register the transfer.

12 Taxation
12.1 Swedish Taxation
The following summary is a general description of certain Swedish tax considerations in relation to the Notes and Conversion Shares for holders who are not residents of Sweden for income tax purposes. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential aspects of Swedish taxation and is neither intended to be nor should it be construed as legal or tax advice. Prospective purchasers of the Notes are urged to consult their professional advisers as to the tax consequences of acquiring, holding or disposing of Notes and Conversion Shares. This summary is based upon the laws of Sweden as in effect on the date of this Offering Circular and is subject to any change in law that may take effect after such date.
Under Swedish law payments of any principal or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a Noteholder will not be subject to Swedish income tax, provided that such holder is neither (i) resident in Sweden for tax purposes nor (ii) engaged in trade or business in Sweden through a permanent establishment to which the Notes are effectively connected.
Swedish law does not provide for deduction or withholding for or on account of taxes on payments of any principal or interest to a Noteholder, except on payment of interest, and any other yield on any Notes which is paid at the same time as interest, to a Noteholder who is a private individual (or an estate of a deceased individual) with tax residence in Sweden.
Subject to what is set out below, a holder of a Note or a Conversion Share that is neither (i) resident in Sweden for tax purposes nor (ii) engaged in trade or business in Sweden through a permanent establishment to which the Notes or Conversion Shares are effectively connected will not be the subject of any Swedish income taxes in connection with the conversion of any Note into Conversion Shares or in connection with the disposal of any Note or Conversion Share. However, such a holder of a Conversion Share will be subject to Swedish withholding tax on any dividend payments and certain other distributions in relation to the Conversion Shares (Sw; kupongskatt) at a tax rate of 30 per cent. (subject to any exemptions under Swedish law or exemptions or reduced tax rates under any applicable tax treaty for the avoidance of double taxation).
Private individuals who have been residents of Sweden or have had a habitual abode in Sweden at any time during a particular calendar year of a disposal or redemption, or during the preceding ten calendar years, are liable for capital gains taxation in Sweden upon a disposal of Conversion Shares and upon a disposal or redemption of Notes if the Notes were to be deemed equity related for Swedish tax purposes. Further, the conversion of the Notes into Conversion Shares may trigger capital gains taxation for such private individuals. In a number of cases though, the applicability of these rules is limited by the applicable tax treaty for the avoidance of double taxation.
12.2 The Proposed Financial Transaction Tax ("FTT")
On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal") for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States"). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.
The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.
Under the Commission's Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member
102

State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT. 12.3 FATCA Withholding Pursuant to certain provisions of U.S. law, commonly known as FATCA, a "foreign financial institution" may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes ("foreign passthru payments") to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting or related requirements. The Issuer believes that it is a foreign financial institution for these purposes. A number of jurisdictions (including Sweden) have entered into, or have agreed in substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA ("IGAs"), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Certain aspects of the application of these rules to instruments such as the Notes, including whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, are not clear at this time. Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, such withholding would not apply prior to 1 January 2019. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on the Notes, no person will be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the withholding.
103

13 Subscription and Sale

The Joint Lead Managers have, pursuant to a Subscription Agreement (the "Subscription Agreement") dated 14 December 2016, jointly and severally agreed to subscribe and pay or, in the case of Swedbank AB (publ) (in its capacity as a joint lead manager), to procure subscribers, for the Notes at the issue price of 100.00 per cent. of the principal amount of the Notes. The Issuer will pay a commission to the Joint Lead Managers pursuant to the Subscription Agreement. The Issuer will also reimburse the Joint Lead Managers in respect of certain of their expenses, and has agreed to indemnify the Joint Lead Managers against certain liabilities incurred in connection with the issue of the Notes. The Subscription Agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances prior to payment to the Issuer.
13.1 General

Other than with respect to the admission to trading and listing of the Notes on the Irish Stock Exchange, no action has been or will be taken in any country or jurisdiction by the Issuer or the Joint Lead Managers that would permit a public offering of the Notes, or possession or distribution of any offering material in relation thereto, in any country or jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. Persons into whose hands this Offering Circular comes are required by the Issuer and the Joint Lead Managers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country or jurisdiction in or from which they purchase, offer, sell or deliver the Notes or have in their possession or distribute such offering material, in all cases at their own expense.
13.2 United States of America

Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act
Each Joint Lead Manager has represented and agreed that it will not offer, sell or deliver such Notes (a) as part of their distribution at any time or (b) otherwise until 40 days after the completion of the distribution, as determined and certified by the relevant lead manager, of such Notes, within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Each Joint Lead Manager has further agreed that it will send to each dealer to which it sells any Notes during the distribution compliance period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons.

5.

In December 2014 the Swedish Shareholders' Association filed a class action against Swedbank

Robur with the National Board for Consumer Disputes ("ARN"). The Swedish Shareholders'

Association claims that two funds, Allemansfond Komplett and Kapitalinvest, were not actively

managed for an extended period and that Swedbank Robur therefore should repay a portion of the

management fee. Swedbank Robur has responded to the Swedish Shareholders' Association's

submission to ARN. The response is comprehensive and outlines several reasons for Swedbank

Robur's opinion that there is no need to compensate the fund owners. Swedbank Robur is of the

opinion that the funds in question have always been managed actively and the company has

openly and regularly disclosed how the funds have been managed and the fees. The issue of

active versus passive management is complicated and affects not only Swedbank Robur but is of

fundamental importance to the industry in Sweden and abroad.

On 1 July 2015 the ARN decided not to proceed with the class action. The ARN stated in the decision that the matter was not suitable for the ARN to try. The Swedish Shareholders' Association subsequently filed a request that the ARN reconsider its decision. On 14 October 2015, the ARN decided not to revise the decision to reject the class action complaint.

The Swedish Shareholders' Association submitted an application in August and December 2015 to the Consumer Ombudsman ("KO") for the KO to take over the class action to represent an individual in an ordinary litigation brought by such an individual against Swedbank Robur. KO rejected this proposal on 4 September 2015 and on 18 December 2015. No known actions from the Swedish Shareholders' Association are ongoing at the moment.

10.

Some of the Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future

engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business

with the Issuer or its affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees

and commissions for these transactions. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business

activities, the Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of

investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and

financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their

customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of

the Issuer or Issuer's affiliates. Certain of the Joint Lead Managers or their affiliates that have a

lending relationship with the Issuer routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent

with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Joint Lead Managers and their

affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the

purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially

the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The

Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or

publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial

instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in

such securities and instruments.

11.

The indication of the yield of the Notes is 6.002 per cent. per annum and is calculated as at the

an indication of future yield.

The language of this Offering Circular is English. Certain legislative references and technical terms

have been cited in their original language in order that the correct technical meaning may be

ascribed to them under applicable law.
