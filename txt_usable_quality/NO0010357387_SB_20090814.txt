Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM" or the "Trustee") acts as loan trustee for the two bond loans with ISIN NO 001035738.7 (the "USD 175 million Bond") and ISIN NO 001037520.7 (the "USD 75 million Convertible Bond") (together the "Bonds") where Nexus 1 Private Limited and Nexus Floating Production Ltd. respectively are the Borrowers (the "Borrower", "Nexus", or the "Company").

Background

In the Bondholders' Meetings held 27 July 2009 for each of the two Bonds, the following was approved by the Bondholders:
(i) the interest payments originally due 7 June 2009 related to the USD 175 million Bond were further deferred until 7 August 2009, and
(ii) the interest payments originally due 25 June 2009 related to the USD 75 million Convertible Bond were further deferred until 11 August 2009.

In the Bondholders' Meetings held 27 July 2009 for each of the two Bonds, the Bondholders also approved the Trustee being given a power of attorney to agree further deferrals of the interest payments due on 7 June 2009 and 25 June 2009, respectively, for maximum periods of 10 Banking Days (the "Original Power of Attorney"). Any such decision for further interest payment deferrals is subject, amongst other matters, to the Trustee obtaining written consent from Bondholders representing a minimum of 50% of the Bondholders in each of the two Bonds. The Trustee obtained such written consents from the Bondholders for each of the two Bonds on 6 August 2009 and, accordingly, has agreed to a further deferral o f the interest payments for each of the two Bonds for a period of 10 Banking Days until 21 August 2009 and 25 August 2009 respectively.
Over the last weeks there have been constructive discussions and meetings between the Company, the Bondholders in the Bonds (including their legal and financial advisers Bingham and AMA, respectively) and the lenders (the "Banks") under the US 320 million term loan facility (the "Bank Facility") in order to seek an acceptable solution to the challenges that Nexus and its stakeholders are facing.
At the same time as such discussions have been taking place, the Company has also been in discussions with Samsung in relation to the date of delivery of the Vessel and the terms of payment of the final instalment due under the Samsung Contract. As a result of these discussions, the Company has agreed with Samsung to enter into an amendment agreement to the Samsung Contract, providing for a deferral of the Effective Delivery Date (as defined below) (the "Amendment Agreement").
The Amendment Agreement provides that the Company and Samsung agree that (i) the Vessel shall be treated as ready for delivery as at the scheduled Delivery Date against payment of a sum of USD 70,000,000, (ii) the Vessel will be laid up for a period of 6 months by Samsung and kept in its custody so that title and risk to the Vessel will not pass to the Company until the effective delivery date of the Vessel (such date not to be later than 6 months from the scheduled Delivery Date (i.e. 27 January 2010) or earlier if possible) (the "Effective Delivery Date") against payment of the balance of the final instalment due under the Samsung Contract, and (iii) Samsung shall be entitled to an additional payment on the Effective Delivery Date in compensation for any and all costs and expenses incurred by them as a result of entering into the Amendment Agreement (including lay-up costs and costs relating to the provision of an extended warranty for the Vessel).
As a result of the execution of the Amendment Agreement, the Company and the Banks have agreed that it will be necessary for the Company to put in place a working capital facility, to rank pari passu with all outstanding amounts due under the existing Bank Facility (the "Working Capital Facility"), in order to cover certain costs for the period up until the Effective Delivery Date.
2

NORSK TILLITSM ANN ASA www.trustee.no
The Working Capital Facility will be advanced by the Banks for the purposes of general operating expenses, lay-up and preservation costs and payment of interest due under the Bank Facility for a period up until the Effective Delivery Date (but will not cover any costs incurred by the Company following 27 January 2010), but the proceeds of the Working Capital Facility shall not be applied to payment of any amounts of interest due on the Bonds or for any restructuring expenses incurred by the Bondholders. The proceeds of the Working Capital Facility shall be deposited in a proceeds account pledged in favour of the Banks (the "Proceeds Account").
The First Proposal
As the Working Capital Facility will rank pari passu with all outstanding amounts due under the existing Bank Facility, it will be necessary to increase the amount of headroom permitted under the Bank Facility from USD 320 million to USD 340 million in order to accommodate the Working Capital Facility. Accordingly, a consequential amendment will be required to be made to the bond loan agreement for the USD 175 million Bonds (the "USD 175 million Bond Loan Agreement") in order to permit the Bank Facility to have the increased amount of headroom contemplated by virtue o f the Working Capital Facility.
The Company therefore proposes the following (the "First Proposal"):
For the USD 175 million Bond:
· Clause 13.2(f) of the USD 175 million Bond Loan Agreement be amended by replacing the words "USD 320 million" in the first and fifth lines of that Clause with the words "USD 340 million".
The Second Proposal
Despite the fact that the Working Capital Facility has been put in place, additional time will be needed to resolve the challenges facing the Company and its stakeholders. The Banks have agreed to only release amounts from the Proceeds Account on a month by month basis, following a satisfactory review by the Banks of the status of the project, with the first such review to be undertaken on 15 October 2009.
It is therefore anticipated that further extensions of the deferral o f interest payments under the Bonds will be required after 21 and 25 August 2009. The Company is therefore asking Bondholders to terminate the Original Power of Attorney granted to the Trustee at the Bondholders' Meeting held 27 July 2009 and to give the Trustee a power of attorney to agree to further deferrals o f the interest payments for the Bonds on the basis that such interest payments will be deferred on a monthly basis from the last Banking Day o f the current month to the last Banking Day of the following month (the "New Power of Attorney"). Such decision for further interest payment deferrals by the Trustee shall be in agreement with a majority of the Bondholders (for the avoidance of doubt this consent shall not be required to be given in a Bondholders' meeting) in each of the USD 175 million Bond and the USD 75 million Convertible Bond, and subject to the Banks having agreed to release sufficient amounts from the Proceeds Account for the month in question, following a satisfactory review of the status of the project.

The Company therefore proposes the following (the "Second Proposal"):
For the USD 175 million Bond:
· The Original Power of Attorney granted to the Trustee at the Bondholders' Meeting held 27 July 2009 be terminated and the Trustee be given the New Power of Attorney on behalf of the Bondholders to agree to further deferrals of the interest payments originally due on 7 June 2009 for periods running from the last Banking day of the current month to the last Banking Day of the following month (or, in August, from 21 August 2009 until the last Banking Day in September), provided that there may be no extension beyond the Effective Delivery Date in accordance with the Amendment Agreement. Such decision for further interest payment deferrals by the Trustee shall be (a) subject to the Trustee obtaining written consent from Bondholders representing a minimum of 50% of the Bondholders in the USD 175 million Bond (for the avoidance of doubt this consent shall not be required to be given in a Bondholders' meeting), (b) subject to the Banks having agreed to release sufficient amounts from the Proceeds Account for the month in question, following a satisfactory review of the status of the project, and (c) subject to the interest payments originally due 25 June 2009 related to the USD 75 million Convertible Bond being further deferred at the same time by the same number of days as the USD 175 million Bond (or otherwise to a date which shall be at least one Banking Day later than the deferred date for the interest payment on the USD 175 million Bond).
For the USD 75 million Convertible Bond:
· The Original Power of Attorney granted to the Trustee at the Bondholders' Meeting held 27 July 2009 be terminated and the Trustee be given the New Power of Attorney on behalf of the Bondholders to agree to further deferrals of the interest payments originally due on 25 June 2009 for periods running from the last Banking day of the current month to the Banking Day immediately following the last Banking Day o f the following month (or, in August, from 25 August 2009 to the Banking Day following the last Banking Day in September), provided that there may be no extension beyond the Effective Delivery Date in accordance with the Amendment Agreement. Such decision for further interest payment deferrals by the Trustee shall be (a) subject to the Trustee obtaining written consent from Bondholders representing a minimum of 50% of Bondholders in the USD 75 million Convertible Bond (for the avoidance o f doubt this consent shall not be required to be given in a Bondholders' meeting), (b) subject to the Banks having agreed to release sufficient amounts from the Proceeds Account for the month in question, following a satisfactory review of the status of the project, and (c) subject to the interest payments originally due 7 June 2009 related to the USD 175 million Bond being further deferred by the Trustee at the same time by the same number of days as the USD 75 million Convertible Bond (or otherwise to a date which is no earlier than 2 Banking Days prior to the deferred date for the interest payment on the USD 75 million Convertible Bond).

The Third Proposal
Bingham's Fees
To date, certain of the fees, costs, disbursements and expenses of Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP ("Bingham"), as legal adviser to the Trustee (on behalf of the bondholders in the USD 175 million Bond (the "175 million Bondholders")), have been met by the Company. However, certain fees, costs and expenses of Bingham remain unpaid, and certain 175 million Bondholders have provisionally agreed to meet these fees, costs and expenses (the "Funding Bondholders"). Further, as the Working Capital Facility expressly provides that it shall not be applied to the payment of any restructuring costs incurred by any of the Bondholders, the Company will not be able to meet these fees and expenses in the future. Accordingly, it is proposed that Bingham's fees, costs and expenses shall be paid directly out of Bond recoveries of the USD 175 million Bond.
It is proposed that the Bondholder meeting authorises the payment by the Trustee of the unpaid fees, costs and expenses of Bingham, or the reimbursement o f those amounts where they have been paid by the Funding Bondholders (the "Bingham Fees") out of amounts it receives for distribution to the 175 million Bondholders (including funds in or received from the Escrow Account), and ahead of payments of principal and interest on the Bonds.
AMA's Fees
To date, certain of the fees, costs, disbursements and expenses of AMA Capital Partners LLC ("AMA"), as financial adviser to the Trustee (on behalf of the 175 million Bondholders), have been met by the Company. However, certain fees, costs and expenses of AMA remain unpaid. Further, as the Working Capital Facility expressly provides that it shall not be applied to the payment of any restructuring costs incurred by any of the Bondholders, the Company will not be able to meet those fees, costs and expenses in the future. Accordingly, it is proposed that AMA's fees, costs and expenses shall be met directly out of Bond recoveries, out of amounts the Trustee receives for distribution to the 175 million Bondholders (including funds in or received from the Escrow Account), and ahead of payments of principal and interest on the Bonds.
Scope o f Work
AMA will continue to provide financial advisory services to the Trustee (on behalf of the 175 million Bondholders) in connection with the current financial situation of the Company, its subsidiaries, and the construction and possible sale of the Vessel. These services will include continuing business due diligence, preparation of marketing materials and promoting the Vessel to prospective counterparties for sale and advising the Trustee and assisting the 175 million Bondholders in negotiations and discussions with the Company, the Banks, any other stakeholders and commercial counterparts.

Fee Structure
Monthly Retainers and Out o fPocket Expenses
Pursuant to AMA's fee agreement, the Company has agreed to pay AMA (i) a monthly retainer of US$100,000 during the initial three months of AMA's retainer (which commenced on 8 May 2009), will be payable out of Bond recoveries of the USD 175 million Bond (to the extent not already paid by the Company), and (ii) after such initial three month periods, a monthly retainer of US$50,000 payable out of Bond recoveries of the USD 175 million Bond (to the extent not already paid by the Company) (together, the "Monthly Retainers").
AMA will also be entitled to reimbursement of its out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with providing its services (the "Out of Pocket Expenses"). The amounts of the Monthly Retainers and the Out of Pocket Expenses shall (to the extent not paid by the Company) be paid directly out of Bond recoveries of the USD 175 million Bond as a joint first priority (together with any amounts payable in respect of Bingham's Fees or to the Trustee on a joint first priority basis) and before any payments of principal and interest on the Bonds.
Transaction Fees
Pursuant to AMA's fee agreement, the Company has agreed to pay AMA: (i) if the Bonds and Bank facility are restructured such that it allows the Company to avoid default under the Bonds for a period of 12 months but without a definitive recovery for the 175 million Bondholders, a fee of US$500,000, or (ii) if the Bonds are restructured in a manner which results in a definitive recovery, AMA shall receive a fee on the principal amount of the USD 175 million Bonds according to the following schedule:

Recovery (R) 0-20%
20% < R < 30% 30% < R < 40% 40% < R < 50 % 50%< R < 75% 75%< R < 100%

Fee 0

Indemnity
The Company has also agreed to (i) indemnify and hold harmless AMA and its affiliates, and the respective directors, officers, agents and employees of AMA and its affiliates (AMA and each such entity or person being referred to as an "Indemnified Person"), from and against any direct losses, claims, demands, damages or liabilities of any kind relating to or arising out of activities performed or services furnished pursuant to AMA's engagement, any transaction or AMA's role in connection therewith and (ii) to reimburse each Indemnified Person for all expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any investigative, administrative, judicial or regulatory action or proceeding in any jurisdiction related to or arising out o f such activities, services, transaction or role, whether or not in connection with pending or threatened litigation to which any Indemnified Person is a party. The Company will not, however, be responsible for any such losses, claims, demands, damages, liabilities or expenses that have resulted from AMA's negligence, willful misconduct or fraud.
Further, AMA's engagement letter provides that no Indemnified Person will have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract, tort or otherwise) to the Trustee or any of its security holders or creditors for or in connection with AMA's engagement, any transaction or AMA's role or services in connection therewith, except for any such liability for losses, claims, demands, damages, liabilities or expenses that have resulted from AMA's negligence, willful misconduct or fraud (the "AMA Indemnity").
The AMA Indemnity (i) shall be capped at a total aggregate amount of US$1,000,000, and (ii) shall terminate 12 months from the date of AMA's engagement save in respect of claims, losses or liabilities which have accrued and which have been notified in writing by AMA to the Trustee prior to that date.
Payments with respect to the AMA Indemnity shall be limited to and only payable out of and to the extent of the value of any further cash recoveries received by the Trustee on behalf of the 175 million Bondholders (based on its pro rata share) on a third priority basis, after payment of any Monthly Retainers and Out of Pocket Expenses and payment of any amounts in respect of Bingham's Fees or to the Trustee on a joint first priority basis, after the payment of the Transaction Fees to AMA on a second priority basis, and before further cash recoveries are distributed to the 175 million Bondholders. The Trustee (provided that it is acting in good faith) shall not be required to retain funds to meet potential payments with respect to the AMA Indemnity.
Other Key Terms
The 175 million Bondholders will have the right to terminate AMA's engagement with five days prior written notice. The AMA engagement will terminate automatically on 8 February 2010. However, certain sections of the engagement letter will survive termination, including but not necessarily limited to (i) expense reimbursement, (ii) indemnification and (iii) that transaction fees will be payable on transactions involving the Vessel originated by AMA on or before the termination of AMA's engagement.

The Trustee's Fees
NTM, in its capacity as Trustee, is continuing to incur fees in connection with its representation of the Bondholders in each Bond issue (including fees incurred by its legal counsel, Thommessen).
The Trustee is required by the Bond Loan Agreements to take every measure to recover the Loans under each Bond issue. Although this provides the Trustee with a wide discretion and authority, in the circumstances the Trustee has decided to request Bondholders to separately authorise and ratify the Trustee to incur costs and expenses in taking measures (in consultation with its legal and financial advisers, Bingham and AMA) to maximise recoveries under each issue of Bonds, and to pay these costs and expenses out of amounts it receives for distribution to Bondholders and ahead of payments of principal and interest on the Bonds.
The Company therefore proposes the following (the "Third Proposal"):
For the USD 175 million Bond:
The Trustee is authorised and instructed to:
(a) pay the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of Bingham, in its representation of the Trustee (on behalf of the 175 million Bondholders), (including by way of reimbursement of Funding Bondholders) and including those incurred but remaining unpaid as at the date of the Bondholders' meeting as a joint first priority with amounts under paragraphs (b), (c) and (f) below and pro rata out of amounts received by the Trustee in connection with the USD 175 million Bonds (including funds in or received from the Escrow Account) and before it makes any payments to any 175 million Bondholders;
(b) pay the reasonable fees and costs (including with respect to legal fees incurred by Thommessen) of the Trustee in connection with maximising recoveries under each issue of Bonds as a joint first priority with amounts under paragraphs (a) above and (c) and (f) below and pro rata out of amounts received by the Trustee in connection with each issue of Bonds (including funds in or received from the Escrow Account) and before it makes any payments to any Bondholders, to be split equally between each issue o f Bonds or as the Trustee otherwise considers (in consultation with Bingham) to be equitable to each issue of Bonds;
(c) pay the Monthly Retainers and Out of Pocket Expenses of AMA incurred in its representation of the Trustee (on behalf of the 175 million Bondholders) as a joint first priority with amounts under paragraphs (a) and (b) above and (f) below and pro rata out of amounts received by the Trustee in connection with the USD 175 million Bonds (including funds in or received from the Escrow Account) and before it makes any payments to any 175 million Bondholders;
(d) pay the Transaction Fees of AMA as a second priority out of any cash recoveries received by the Trustee (on behalf of the 175 million Bondholders) and ahead o f any payments of AMA Indemnity amounts to AMA under paragraph (e) below and before it makes any payments to and 175 million Bondholders;
