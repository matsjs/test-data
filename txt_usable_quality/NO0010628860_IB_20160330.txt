Nordic Trustee ASA acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds in the above mentioned issue (the "Bonds") with ISIN NO 001 062886.0 issued by Chloe Marine Corporation Ltd. Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in bond agreement constituting the Bonds dated 16 November 2011.
