Results and main developments for the year ended December 31, 2017
Fourth quarter results The net result after tax for the year 2017 amounted to a profit of U.S.$4.7 million compared to a loss of U.S.$8.7 million for the year 2016. EBITDA for the year 2017 was U.S.$155.6 million compared to U.S.$190.0 million for the year 2016. The financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017 were mainly impacted by the following items:
The SPM division generated U.S.$16.1 million EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in U.S.$35.6 million EBITDA for the year 2017 compared to U.S.$39.2 million EBITDA for the year 2016. In 2017, progress on the running SPM projects are either in design or in final stages, resulting in lower EBITDA recognition compared to the year 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 showed an increase in EBITDA compared to the third quarter of 2017.
The fourth quarter 2017 EBITDA for the FPSO division was U.S.$32.5 million, resulting in U.S.$128.2 million EBITDA for the FPSO division for the year 2017 compared to U.S.$160.4 million EBITDA for the year 2016. The U.S.$32.2 million decrease in EBITDA compared to the year 2016 was mainly driven by a U.S.$26.0 million decrease in EBITDA for the FPSO Glas Dowr. This decrease in EBITDA is due to the recognition of the largest part of the termination fee following the termination for convenience by ENI in 2016 compared to the lay-up of the vessel in the year 2017. EBITDA of the FPSO Aoka Mizu reduced by U.S.$10.2 million. FPSO Aoka Mizu stopped production from the Ettrick field on June 1,2016. EBITDA of the FPSO Bleo Holm decreased by U.S.$3.9 million due to lower tariff income in the year 2017 compared to the year 2016 mainly as a result of a planned maintenance shut down in July 2017 and some technical issues in October and November of this year. EBITDA for the FPSO Haewene Brim increased by U.S.$4.6 million compared to the year 2016. This increase was caused by lower credits on the lease in 2017 compared to 2016 following high availability of the FPSO during the reporting period. The company achieved cost savings on the lay-up of the Munin in the year 2017 compared to the year 2016, thereby realizing a U.S.$1.2 million EBITDA improvement for the FPSO. Finally FPSO tender costs in the year 2017 decreased by U.S.$2.1 million, despite the increase in number of tender prospects in 2017.
During the year 2017, unallocated expenses amounted to U.S.$8.2 million, compared to U.S.$9.7 million for the year 2016. The unallocated expenses for the year 2016 include a reorganization provision of U.S.$0.8 million. The portion unallocated expenses in 2017 was lower than in same period of 2016 despite higher one-off legal, advisory and professional services costs associated with the various amendments of our existing finance facilities and a lower overhead charge as a result of FPSO Aoka Mizu and FPSO Glas Dowr being off contract for the full year. This was compensated by a higher utilisation of engineering and project management staff.
Depreciation and amortization expenditure for the year 2017 amounted to U.S.$107.7 million compared to U.S.$150.7 million for the year 2016 which includes the impairment of intangible assets of U.S.$33.1 million. Decommissioning of FPSO Glas Dowr was completed on March 1,2016 and decommissioning of FPSO Aoka Mizu on August 1,2016. As from these dates the FPSOs were classified as `FPSOs held for conversion' and are depreciated on an adjusted depreciation rate after the reassessment of the anticipated useful life. Since August 14, 2017 the Aoka Mizu has been under contract for conversion for the Lancaster project for Hurricane. As of that date the Aoka Mizu has been re-classified from `FPSO held for conversion' to `FPSO under construction' . Management also assessed indications for potential impairment of the intangible assets and other financial investments related to its upstream activities, concluding that for an amount of U.S.$33.1 million of capitalized license fees and other financial investments required impairment in the year 2016 compared to nil in 2017.
Finance expenses were U.S.$2.0 million lower compared to the previous year, at U.S.$56.2 million versus U.S.$58.2 million for the year 2016. The amendment agreements to the senior secured project finance facility and corporate credit facility have led to one-off additional amortization expenditures of debt arrangement fees of
2

U.S.$1.3 million due to recalculation of the debt arrangement fees over the remainder period of the facilities in 2016. In the third quarter of 2017 an amount of U.S.$4.7 million was added to the debt arrangement fees. These arrangement fees consist of legal, advisory, professional, upfront and commission fees and costs incurred to get in place the overrun finance facility for the Hurricane project of which U.S.$1.8 million was amortized in 2017. The bond interest costs increased with U.S.$1.9 million in 2017 compared with 2016 as a result of quiet enjoyment in favour of Hurricane of the Aoka Mizu needed to ensure the Hurricane contract. This increase in bond interest is added to the bond value as payment in kind interest. Other interest costs decreased by U.S.$4.4 million compared to the previous year, mainly due to further reduction of net debt. Currency exchange results were U.S.$2.1 million negative in the year 2017 compared to U.S.$3.3 million positive in the year 2016. The significant decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and Pound Sterling has led to negative exchange results in the year 2017. The currency exchange rate moved from EUR/USD 1.06 and GBP/USD 1.23 at the begin of the year to EUR/USD 1.20 and GBP/USD 1.35 at the end of the year 2017. Because the Company's revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollar and a part of the expenses are in EUR and GBP, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Only in the fourth quarter of the year 2017 there were currency exchange contracts in place, the remainder of the year there were no credit lines. Income tax benefit for the year 2017 amounted U.S.$14.3 million versus U.S.$5.8 million income tax benefit for the year 2016. The 2016 income tax benefit relates to a U.S.$6.4 million increase in the deferred tax asset and a U.S.$0.6 million tax expense mainly in relation to Glas Dowr withholding tax and Australian corporate tax. The U.S.$14.3 million income tax benefit in 2017 relates to a U.S.$12.7 million increase in the deferred tax asset and the remainder of U.S.$1.6 million mainly relates to refunds as a result of recalculation of Glas Dowr corporate income tax paid in prior years.

Other developments
On November 28, 2016, the Company has signed a Heads of Terms with Hurricane Energy, a UK listed oil and gas-company focused on hydrocarbon resources in naturally fractured basement reservoirs, for the use of the Aoka Mizu FPSO on the Lancaster field, West of Shetland. Following the signing of the Agreement, the Company and Hurricane have substantially concluded the second phase FEED study at the end of March, 2017. On April 4, 2017, the bondholders were served with a notice of a written resolution to permit the implementation of the Head of Terms with Hurricane and related bond amendments. On April 11,2017, The Nordic Trustee ASA confirmed that the proposed resolution was passed with the requisite majority of voting bonds voting in favour of the proposed resolution and therefore the bond agreement was changed as set out in the notice. On May 3, 2017, the project finance facility lenders consented to enter into a Hurricane letter of quiet enjoyment and bond coupon increase. Subsequently, Hurricane agreed to authorize the Company to procure long lead items in order to keep the project on schedule to deliver first oil by end of 1H 2019. On June 23, 2017, the Company and Hurricane Energy Plc (``Hurricane'') reached agreement on the key contracts outlining terms for the upgrade, lease and operation of the FPSO Aoka Mizu (" Transaction Documents'') in connection with the Early Production System on Hurricane's Lancaster Field (``Lancaster EPS''). On June 30, 2017, Hurricane announced a fundraising of U.S.$530.0 million to fund capital expenditure in relation to the Lancaster EPS. The Transaction Documents became effective in accordance with their terms on August 14, 2017.
On June 30, 2017, Repsol Sinopec Resources UK Limited gave notice of extending the firm period of the bareboat charter for FPSO Bleo Holm at unchanged charter terms. The firm contract period now runs up until June 30, 2019.
In the SPM Segment, the Company has commenced works for the delivery of 3 buoy systems, with delivery of these buoy systems being expected by Q2 2018.
The corporate facility that was scheduled to mature on December 31,2017 has been extended till March 31, 2018. The availability under the facility is U.S.$5.0 million until a new lender or lenders are found.
Outlook
The outlook for the year 2018 looks promising for the Company. The increase in the oil price and the economic upturn has led to multiple interests in both assets held for conversion as well as for SPM opportunities. We started with paid preparatory studies for these FPSOs. Also the interest of our clients in the SPM segment has significantly increased.
The Company has entered into discussions with its existing and new lenders to arrange a new corporate facility, reflecting the improved market conditions and the performance of the Company. This goes in parallel with the target to refinance the unsecured subordinated bond in prior to its expiry in 2019.
Given the current business outlook and the liquidity forecast, the Company expects to be in compliance with its covenants under the existing loan agreements (including the Corporate Facility, the Project Finance Facility and the Bond Loan).

General information Aurelia Energy N.V. (``the Company'') is the holding company of the Bluewater group (Bluewater), a specialized service provider to, and operator in, the offshore oil industry. Bluewater designs, develops, owns and operates floating production storage and offloading units (``FPSOs''), provides auxiliary equipment and services to FPSOs and designs, develops, performs project management and constructs single point mooring systems (``SPMs''). An FPSO is a type of floating production unit used by oil companies to produce, process, store and offload hydrocarbons from offshore fields. FPSOs are either newly built or converted tankers upon which production equipment is mounted. The fluids (oil, gas and water) are processed on board the FPSO vessel, and the treated crude oil is stored before being exported to an off take system utilizing shuttle tankers. Bluewater's fleet of FPSOs is involved in the production, rather than the exploration or drilling phase of oil field development. The FPSOs are leased to oil companies under medium- and long-term service contracts or bareboat contracts. SPMs are used to transfer fluids to and from a floating production unit, an offshore storage vessel or shuttle tanker while securing the unit, vessel or tanker to the ocean floor. Most SPMs consist of an anchoring system that is connected to the ocean floor and a fluid transfer system that permits the transfer of fluids between fixed and rotating parts of the mooring system. SPMs are generally developed and constructed for oil companies and contractors. Revenues are earned from day rates consisting of a fixed facility fee and a compensation for operating the FPSO pursuant to leases with oil companies, supplemented from time to time with fees based on volumes of produced barrels of oil. Additionally, revenues are earned on a lump-sum or reimbursable basis from the design, engineering, procurement and management services that are provided in the various FPSO and SPM projects being managed. FPSO and SPM projects are being managed from the initial design and engineering phase to final installation. Further, Bluewater engages subcontractors in the fabrication of FPSOs, SPMs and auxiliary equipment.

Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements
Reporting entity Aurelia Energy N.V. (``the Company'') has its legal seat in Willemstad (Curasao). The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as at and for the period ended December 31,2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as ``the Group'' or ``Bluewater'' and individually as ``Group entities'') and the Group's interest in jointly controlled entities.
Statement of compliance The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as applied in the most recent annual financial statements.
Basis of preparation These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in thousands of US dollars, which is the Company's functional currency. All financial information presented has been rounded to the nearest thousand. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with the recognition and measurement criteria of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as applied in the most recent annual financial statements. The information furnished in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of such financial statements. Although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, it is suggested that these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31,2016.
The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are:
 Revenue recognition on construction contracts based on the percentage of completion method;  Estimation of the anticipated useful life and future revenues earned with the FPSOs, which along with
the discount rate, is the basis for the recoverable amounts of FPSOs;  Estimation of the realizable amount of tax losses carried forward;  Potential impact of claims and litigation.
10

1. Segment information
The disclosure of segment information is consistent with the internal reports in order to assess each segment's performance and to allocate resources to them. Internal reporting is primarily based on business segments since the Company's risks and rates of return are affected primarily by differences in services and products produced.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly employee benefits expense, head office expenses, investments and related revenue and income tax assets and liabilities. For both presented periods there are no inter segment revenues.
