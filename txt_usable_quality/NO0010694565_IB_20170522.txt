To the bondholders in:

ISIN: NO 001 0694565

7.75 per cent World Wide Supply AS 13/17 Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue

Oslo, 22 May 2017

Technical extension of Maturity Date

Nordic Trustee ASA is appointed as bond trustee (the "Bond Trustee") for the bond issue with ISIN NO 001 069456 (the "Bonds") issued by World Wide Supply AS, (the "Issuer" or "WWS") pursuant to the terms of the bond agreement (the "Bond Agreement") dated 27 November 2013 (as amended) between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders (as defined in the Bond Agreement).

Reference is made to the resolution in the Bondholders' Meeting on 22 December 2016 as further described in the summons to Bondholders' Meeting dated 15 December 2016 (the "Summons"). All capitalised terms used but not defined herein shall have the same meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement and the Summons.

Reference is also made to the letter to the Bondholders dated 23 January 2017, where it is stated that the Bond Trustee declared the Bonds to be in Default and accelerated the Bonds. Further, the Bond Trustee requested the Issuer to sell the Vessel as set out in the Summons. Closing of the Transaction was 27 January 2017. Net proceeds from the Transaction was made to the Bondholders on 3 February 2017. Information regarding future payments will be given in due course.

According to the Bond Agreement, the Maturity Date for the Bonds is 26 May 2017. As it is expected that further payments will be made to the Bondholders in the period following the Maturity Date, the maturity date in VPS will for purely practical reasons be extended by 3 months to 26 August 2017 (the "Technical Maturity Date"). The technical extension of the maturity date will make trading and transactions connected to the Bonds easier, and facilitate future payments to the Bondholders. In addition, the technical extension of the maturity date will eliminate uncertainty with regards to the individual Bondholders' ability to prove their full holding with respect to the voting in future Bondholders' Meetings.

If you have any questions to the above please contact the Bond Trustee: Lars Erik Lasrum, laerum@nordictrustee.com. +47 22 87 94 06
