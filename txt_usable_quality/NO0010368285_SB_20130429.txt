1 THE RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL 1.1 The overall restructuring plan Due to the financial position and debt of the Borrower, the Borrower needs to carry out a debt restructuring.

As of 31 October 2012, the Borrower had a total debt of approximately USD 65,300,000, of which a total amount of approximately USD 28,359,670 plus interest accrued thereon is due to suppliers each holding unsecured claims in excess o f USD 200,000 against the Borrower. These suppliers are requested to convert their claims into equity in the Conversion Issue (as further described and defined below). Creditors with secured claims and certain other creditors with justifiable and legitimate reasons are not subject to the debt conversion. Creditors with claims subject to the Conversion Issue are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Conversion Creditors" and individually "Conversion Creditor".
For the purpose of improving the balance sheet of the Borrower as of 31 October 2012, the Borrower will raise minimum USD 5 million in cash in a share issue (the "Cash Issue"), sell certain assets of the Borrower and convert the total debt to the Conversions Creditors (the "Conversion Amount") into equity in the Borrower (the "Conversion Issue"). The Cash Issue is a condition in the agreement with the Conversion Creditors, however, said creditors may waive this condition at their discretion. The proceeds o f the Cash Issue (if completed) will be applied to pay debt of the Borrower as per 31 October 2012.
1.2 The Proposal
The Borrower proposes that the Bonds including interest accrued thereon be converted to equity of the Borrower on the same conditions as those applicable to the Conversion Creditors (the "Proposal"). The Proposal is conditional on the Bondholders approving with more than 2/3 majority the conversion of all outstanding amounts under the Bonds to shares in the Borrower.
The conversion rate in the Proposal will be identical to the conversion rate (subscription price) in the Conversion Issue (the "Subscription Price"), and the Borrower will through an accelerated book-building process to the fullest extent possible also seek to complete the Cash Issue on the same or similar terms, including at the same Subscription Price. However, to the extent deemed necessary to complete the Cash Issue, the Conversion Creditors may at their discretion accept that the subscription price in the Cash Issue deviates from the subscription price in the Conversion Issue and the Proposal.
Completion of (i) the Cash Issue, (ii) the conversion of the Conversions Creditors' claims against the Borrower and (iii) the Proposal are hereinafter referred to as the "Debt Restructuring". If waived by the Conversion Creditors, the Debt Restructuring will not depend on the Cash Issue being completed.

1.3 Board evaluation

The Borrower's board of directors (the "Board") has evaluated the financial effect of the Debt Restructuring, and the relevant measures are expected to provide the Borrower with positive net working capital and provide a basis for enhancing the further business of the Borrower. Although there can be given no guarantee for the further development of the Borrower, a business plan for 2013, 2014 and 2015 is attached hereto as Appendix 1 ("Business Plan"), illustrating a potential course o f the Borrower's further development.

It is currently contemplated that a general meeting of the Borrower for adoption and completion of the Conversion Issue, the Proposal and the Cash Issue is held by 31 May 2013 at the latest.

Based on the Cash Issue, the Proposal and the Conversion Issue, the estimated balance of the Borrower is expected to be as set out in Appendix 2 (the "Estimated Balance"), and cash projection for the period 1 November 2012 to 30 June 2013 is enclosed hereto as Appendix 3 (the "Cash Projections"). The Cash Projections is estimating a positive cash flow for the Borrower for the period (1 November 2012 to 30 June 2013).

2 EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL
2.1 The Borrower's evaluation
The Borrower has an urgent need to reduce its debt and strengthen its equity and liquidity.
Should the Debt Restructuring, including the Proposal, not be approved and carried out, the Board of the Borrower will be forced to file for bankruptcy. Such a situation is unfortunately considered to provide a very low (if any) recovery value to all outstanding unsecured creditors o f the Borrower.
2.2 The Bond Trustee's evaluation
The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the Proposal is acceptable.

NORSK TILLITSMANN

2. The Bondholders waive any Event of Default having occurred under the Bond Agreement prior to the date hereof if the Proposal is approved and the Debt Restructuring completed.
The resolution above will be subject to the following conditions precedent being satisfied or waived by the Bond Trustee on or within 31 May 2013 or such later date as the Bond Trustee may agree at its discretion. Failure to do so will result in the bondholder resolution being deemed null and void.

NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
c. Successful completion of the Debt Restructuring.
The Bondholders irrevocably grant Norsk Tillitsmann a power of attorney, on their behalf, upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent to implement the resolution above and to subscribe the relevant number of shares resulting from the conversion of the Bonds into ordinary shares of the Borrower. Norsk Tillitsmann is granted power of attorney to sign any document or statement on behalf of the Bondholders to implement the Proposal. Norsk Tillitsmann is also granted the authority, on behalf of the Bondholders, to agree to any minor adjustment to the Proposal and waiver o f conditions precedent to facilitate the implementation o f the Proposal.
***
To approve the resolution regarding the Bonds, Bondholders representing at least 2/3 of the Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the meeting must vote in favor of the resolution. In order to have a quorum, at least 5/10 of the voting bonds must be represented at the meeting. If the proposal is not adopted, the Bond Agreement will remain unchanged.
Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.)
The individual bondholder may authorise Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Norsk Tillitsmann to vote, must then be returned to Norsk Tillitsmann in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which Norsk Tillitsmann accepts as sufficient proof o f the ownership o f the Bonds.

NORSK TILLITSMANN
