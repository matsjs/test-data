Results and main developments for the year ended December 31, 2014
Fourth quarter results The net profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was U.S.$2.8 million compared to a profit of U.S.$34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2014 was U.S.$180.5 million compared to U.S.$216.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The financial results for the fourth quarter of 2014 were mainly impacted by the following:
The SPM division generated U.S.$14.9 million EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in U.S.$36.7 million EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to U.S.$38.1 million EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2013. During the fourth quarter, some SPM projects reached final stages of completion, resulting in a significant contribution to EBITDA. Other SPM projects reached significant progress and will continue to contribute to EBITDA during 2015.
The fourth quarter 2014 EBITDA for the FPSO division was U.S.$40.5 million, resulting in U.S.$150.1 million EBITDA for the FPSO division for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to U.S.$189.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The U.S.$39.4 million decrease in EBITDA compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 was mainly caused by a U.S.$22.7 million decrease in EBITDA of the FPSO Haewene Brim. This difference in EBITDA largely relates to a U.S.$25.7 million cost reimbursement for mooring leg repairs that were executed in 2012. This cost reimbursement was recorded as benefit in 2013 and was fully collected from our insurers and client during 2014. The remaining movement in EBITDA for the FPSO Haewene Brim was due to amortization of deferred revenue related to the Brynhild project, largely offset by increased maintenance costs and reduced income during the latter period of the Brynhild project. EBITDA for the FPSO Glas Dowr reduced by U.S.$5.8 million compared to the previous year, due to higher operational expenditures and downtime penalties, mainly resulting from equipment failures during the year, which have now been resolved. Additionally, EBITDA of the FPSO Aoka Mizu decreased by U.S.$2.7 million due to declining field production and repair costs related to the water injection swivel. Furthermore, EBITDA of the FPSO Bleo Holm decreased by U.S.$7.0 million due to a decreased day rate as per the contract amendment that became effective August 1, 2014, combined with low tariff income as a result of low production in August and November and nil production in September and October. Finally, FPSO tender costs in 2014 increased by U.S.$1.2 million, mainly due to the tender activities in relation to the Pemex project for the FPSO Munin.
Modification and life time extension work on the FPSO Haewene Brim to prepare the vessel for tie-in and production of the Brynhild field was completed in November 2014 and the FPSO resumed production on the Pierce field on December 12, 2014. The costs related to the modification and life time extension work are fully reimbursed by the Brynhild field owners. During the year ended December 31, 2014, such costs, amounting to US$89.9 million, have been capitalized and related revenues have been deferred, resulting in nil impact on EBITDA. From December 2014, the total capitalized costs related to the Brynhild project amounting to U.S.$310.8 million are being depreciated and related deferred revenues are amortized and are thus recognized as income in the profit and loss account. Consequently, an amount of U.S.$6.1 million revenue is included in EBITDA in the fourth quarter, which is offset by an equal amount of depreciation, with nil net effect on profit and loss.
Overhead costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 were U.S.$6.3 million versus U.S.$11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in overhead costs was largely driven by an increased recovery on overhead costs as a result of a higher workload of the engineering organization compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Additionally, Euro denominated costs decreased as a result of the decreasing Euro ­ Dollar exchange rate during the last quarter.
Depreciation expenditure decreased by U.S.$7.8 million, at U.S.$83.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to U.S.$91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was driven by one of
2

the assets being fully depreciated, partly offset by an increase in the depreciation charge of FPSO Haewene Brim following completion of the Brynhild project.
Finance expenses were U.S.$8.8 million lower compared to the previous year, at U.S.$66.6 million versus U.S.$75.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. Finance expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 included U.S.$14.5 million of non-recurring costs in relation to the refinancing of the Glas Dowr project financing, amendments of the corporate facility and refinancing of the U.S.$360 million unsecured bond, compared to only U.S.$0.4 million of non-recurring costs in relation to the cancellation of the interest rate swap on the U.S.$360 million unsecured bond loan for the year ended December 31, 2014. Finance expense for the bond loan increased by U.S.$12.6 million, from U.S.$28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to U.S.$41.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The year ended December 31, 2014 includes U.S.$40.0 million interest on the new U.S.$400 million bond loan and U.S.$1.4 million interest in relation to the U.S.$360 million unsecured bond loan that was repaid on January 27, 2014, compared to U.S.$26.5 million interest on the U.S.$360 million unsecured bond and U.S.$2.3 million accrued interest on the new U.S.$400 million bond loan in the year ended December 31, 2013. Other interest costs decreased by U.S.$7.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease resulted from further reduction in net debt, resulting from steady operating cash flow.
Currency exchange results were U.S.$19.4 million negative in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to U.S.$3.1 million positive in the year ended December 31, 2013. The currency exchange results relate mainly to the negative fair value of Euro denominated forward currency contracts that were entered into to hedge the currency exposure on SPM projects.
Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was U.S.$7.8 million versus U.S.$17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The income tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to U.S.$6.7 million withholding tax incurred in relation to the Glas Dowr revenues, U.S.$1.4 million corporate taxes in other jurisdictions and U.S.$0.3 million increase of the deferred tax asset. The U.S.$17.7 million income tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2013 included a U.S.$7.9 million reduction of the deferred tax asset, U.S.$6.8 million withholding tax incurred in relation to the Glas Dowr revenues and U.S.$3.0 million of other foreign taxes.
Other developments
On May 26, 2014, a major SPM contract was awarded for the engineering and related procurement and construction of two turret and swivel systems, with total revenues amounting to circa U.S.$300 million. This project is expected to start contributing to EBITDA early 2015.
On June 30, 2014, a legal dispute that arose from the ordinary course of business several years ago, with Bluewater as claimant, was resolved in Bluewater's favour resulting in a preliminary claim award of U.S.$6.4 million. On September 30, 2014, final settlement was reached, resulting in an additional claim award of U.S.$4.3 million. The total claim award of U.S.$10.7 million is included in the SPM result for the period ended December 31, 2014.
On November 5, 2014, a contract extension option for the FPSO Bleo Holm was exercised by our client, with retrospective effect from August 1, 2014. The bareboat charter agreement has been extended with a firm 3-year period until August 1, 2017, with annual extension options thereafter, and the charter hire rate and production tariff have been adjusted from this date.
On November 17, 2014, Bluewater has relocated its head office to an entirely new building not far from its former premises. It has been designed in accordance with the latest principles on sustainability and will provide a modern and healthy work environment that enhances cooperation and communication.

General information Aurelia Energy N.V. ("the Company") is the holding company of the Bluewater group (Bluewater), a specialized service provider to, and operator in, the offshore oil industry. Bluewater designs, develops, owns and operates floating production storage and offloading units ("FPSOs"), provides auxiliary equipment and services to FPSOs and designs, develops, performs project management and constructs single point mooring systems ("SPMs"). An FPSO is a type of floating production unit used by oil companies to produce, process, store and offload hydrocarbons from offshore fields. FPSOs are either newly built or converted tankers upon which production equipment is mounted. The fluids (oil, gas and water) are processed onboard the FPSO vessel, and the treated crude oil is stored before being exported to an off take system utilizing shuttle tankers. Bluewater's fleet of FPSOs is involved in the production, rather than the exploration or drilling phase of oil field development. The FPSOs are leased to oil companies under medium- and long-term service contracts or bareboat contracts. SPMs are used to transfer fluids to and from a floating production unit, an offshore storage vessel or shuttle tanker while securing the unit, vessel or tanker to the ocean floor. Most SPMs consist of an anchoring system that is connected to the ocean floor and a fluid transfer system that permits the transfer of fluids between fixed and rotating parts of the mooring system. SPMs are generally developed and constructed for oil companies and contractors. Revenues are earned from day rates consisting of a fixed facility fee and a compensation for operating the FPSO pursuant to leases with oil companies, supplemented from time to time with fees based on volumes of produced barrels of oil. Additionally, revenues are earned on a lump-sum or reimbursable basis from the design, engineering, procurement and management services that are provided in the various FPSO and SPM projects being managed. FPSO and SPM projects are being managed from the initial design and engineering phase to final installation. Further, Bluewater engages subcontractors in the fabrication of FPSOs, SPMs and auxiliary equipment.

Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements
Reporting entity Aurelia Energy N.V. ("the Company") has its legal seat in Willemstad (Curaçao). The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as at and for the period ended December 31, 2014 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as "the Group" or "Bluewater" and individually as "Group entities") and the Group's interest in jointly controlled entities.
Statement of compliance The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as applied in the most recent annual financial statements.
Basis of preparation These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in thousands of US dollars, which is the Company's functional currency. All financial information presented has been rounded to the nearest thousand. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with the recognition and measurement criteria of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as applied in the most recent annual financial statements. The information furnished in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of such financial statements. Although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, it is suggested that these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2013.
The preparation of these unaudited interim financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the unaudited interim financial statements are:
 Revenue recognition on construction contracts based on the percentage of completion method;  Estimation of the anticipated useful life and future revenues earned with the leased facilities;  Estimation of the realizable amount of tax losses carried forward;  Potential impact of claims and litigation.
1. Segment information
The disclosure of segment information is consistent with the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to assess each segment's performance and to allocate resources to them. Internal reporting is primarily based on business segments since the Company's risks and rates of return are affected primarily by differences in services and products produced.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly employee benefits expense, head office expenses, investments and related revenue and income tax assets and liabilities. For both presented periods there are no inter segment revenues.
