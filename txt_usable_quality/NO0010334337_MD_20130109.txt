Implementation of the restructuring - Exchange of bonds 17 January 2013 Norsk Tillitsmann ASA acts as trustee for the holders of bonds (the "Bondholders") in the "FRN Eitzen Chemical ASA Callable Bond Issue 2006/2011", consisting of a NOK tranche with ISIN NO 001033434.5 and USD tranche with ISIN NO 001033433.7 (the "Bond Issue"), where Eitzen Chemical ASA is the issuer.
Reference is made to the summons to bondholders' meeting dated 29 November 2012 (the "Summons"), and the bondholders' meeting held 7 December 2012, in which a restructuring proposal was adopted.
All capitalized terms used herein shall, unless otherwise defined herein, have the meanings assigned to them in the Summons.
The Bond Issue will be exchanged into two new bond issues as described in the Summons. 50/110 of the principle amount under the Bond Issue will be exchanged into the Third Lien Bond Loan, and 60/110 of the principle amount under the Bond Issue will be exchanged into the Unsecured Bond (together with the Third Lien Bond Loan, the "New Bonds"). In addition, all interest accrued from and including 4 October 2012 will be exchanged into the Third Lien Bond Loan.
Please note that the Bond Issue consists of a USD tranche and a NOK tranche. The tranches in the Bond Issue will be exchanged into tranches with the same currency in both the Third Lien Bond Loan and the Unsecured Bond respectively, meaning that no Bondholder shall receive bonds denominated in other currencies than what they have already got.
