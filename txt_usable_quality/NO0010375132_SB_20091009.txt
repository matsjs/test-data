1 BACKGROUND
Marine Subsea is facing a liquidity crisis requiring in excess of USD 230 million in new funding during the next 12 months to secure the delivery of the Sarah and Karianne vessels, and the Lifter and Worker barges and to prepare for their operational start-up. In addition, Marine Subsea has identified further capital expenditure requirements amounting to approximately USD 21.2 million as further described in the supporting information memorandum (the "Information Memorandum") to be published on www.marinesubsea.no.
Management has worked on addressing Marine Subsea's financial distress by raising new financing in a challenging market through a combination of measures; hereunder proposed new long-term borrowings totalling USD 222 million under two export-credit backed facilities (to be underwritten) and rescheduling of payments under some of the construction contracts.
Please refer to the Information Memorandum for background information regarding the restructuring proposal, hereunder the recent developments, financial information, status on the construction and the rationale for the proposal set forth in this summons.

2 SUMMARY OF PROPOSED CHANGES'TO THE LOAN AGREEMENTS
The Borrower has approached the Loan Trustee with a proposal to be put forward to the bondholders in the FRNs and the Convertible Bond, covering a restructuring of the Borrower's financial debt, as described below (together the "Restructuring Plan").
2.1 The Restructuring Plan and rationale
Marine Subsea is proposing a restructuring of the FRNs and the Convertible Bond, with a view to achieving the following objectives:
(i) Full repayment of bondholders' principal and the continued payment of interest; (ii) Enhancement of bondholders' prospect of repayment by providing financing for the
completion and delivery of all vessels and barges; (iii) Matching of Marine Subsea's debt maturities with its projected cash flow generation
capacity; and (iv) Enabling the raising of new long-term financing to fully fund all existing projects to
completion and see the Borrower's assets become income producing and cash flow generative.
The Restructuring Plan will provide Marine Subsea with a solid financial foundation to transform itself from being a `start-up' operator to an established provider of subsea well-intervention and offshore services to major Exploration and Production ("E&P") companies. Marine Subsea will be able to retain and monetise its key client relationship with Sonangol including the 10-year `take or pay' contracts for the Sarah and Karianne (see Section 8 of the Information Memorandum for further details) vessels and the Safe Challenger crane ship. Furthermore, Marine Subsea and its creditors will benefit from expansion of its fleet from three to seven units (being two well-intervention vessels and five support / accommodation barges), and greater diversification of its customer base and sources of cash flow.
The Restructuring Plan requires a `lock-in' of Marine Subsea's founding shareholders, Mårten.Rød and Gian Angelo Perrucci, with no dividends or distributions to shareholders until bondholders and the new export-credit lenders are repaid in full. Subject to the proposed terms and conditions of the Exchange Bonds - Series I and II (as described below) and the two export-credit backed facilities excess cash generated within the Sarah and Karianne operating subsidiaries will be permitted to be up-streamed to the group parent, Marine Subsea, to service its indebtedness to bondholders provided the export-credit backed facilities remain in compliance with their covenants.
The Restructuring Plan is predicated on Marine Subsea's potentially largest revenue generating assets, the Sarah and Karianne vessels being financed with export-credit backed project finance facilities in order to ensure such vessels are completed and placed on contract for the benefit of Marine Subsea as a whole. As such, the Restructuring Plan will necessitate the granting of priority security over Marine Subsea's shares in Sarah and Karianne, the Sarah and Karianne vessels, their construction contracts, assets and cash flows in favour of new lenders, Eksportfinans ASA, Standard Bank Pic and any other commercial lenders brought into the syndicate (the "New Lenders"). Sonangol has an existing 25% shareholding in the Sarah entity in consideration for previously entering into the long-term contract in respect of Sarah and will receive, post the acceptance of the Restructuring Plan and on or prior to Exchange Date, a 25% shareholding in the Karianne entity in consideration for entering into a long term contract in respect of Karianne. Furthermore, Sonangol will receive a 25% shareholding in the Lifter entity in consideration for a 5-year charter contract on the Lifter barge.

NO RSK TILLITSM AN N ASA
The existing bondholder security packhpfi$sthe'rSfore to be amended on the terms described below which include the release of all security interests in the Sarah and Karianne and the subsequent grant to the Loan Trustee for the bondholders of a second ranking mortgage over each vessel and security over the residual interest in the proceeds of the disposition of Sarah and Karianne following payment in full to the New Lenders. The bondholders' second ranking mortgage will be subject to the terms of an intercreditor agreement pursuant to which the Loan Trustee will have no right to enforce such mortgage until the New Lenders have been paid in full.
In addition, in order to achieve a change in contractual payment terms with Ulstein for the construction of the Karianne (releasing NOK 160 million from a prepayment made to Ulstein in connection with the Karianne construction project in partial settlement of the final payment for Sarah), Ulstein requires temporary security over the Installer barge and its cash flows until it has received full payment for the Karianne. The bondholders' security package will therefore also need to be amended to reflect this.
FRN Bonds - Payments
To implement the Restructuring Plan, holders in each of the FRNs are asked to accept a mandatory exchange of their bonds held as at the exchange date into a single new senior secured USD denominated bond, called the Exchange Bond - Series I (refer to enclosed term sheets for Exchange Bond - Series I and Series II). Any accrued and unpaid interest on the FRN Bonds as at exchange date will be paid in cash (to the holder of the Exchange Bond - Series I for which the relevant FRN Bonds were exchanged) on or before the first interest payment date (being three months after the exchange date) for the Exchange Bond - Series I. The Exchange Bond - Series I will have a 10-year scheduled final maturity date and pay a quarterly coupon of 9.00% per annum for the first two years and thereafter 12.00% per annum in cash or, during the first two years after issue, 12.00% per annum pay-in-kind ("PIK ") in the event of a shortfall in Marine Subsea's cash flow and as further set out in the proposed terms and conditions of the Exchange Bond - Series I. The PIK feature will be a fixed mechanism (and not at Marine Subsea's discretion) only to be applied, or partially applied as the case may be, in the event that Marine Subsea, pursuant to the proposed terms and conditions of the Exchange Bond - Series I has insufficient cash to pay all or part of the interest coupon due, but will only operate when and if the entire coupon under Exchange Bond - Series II (as defined below) is paid as PIK. The Exchange Bond - Series I will be repaid from cash in Marine Subsea received from all its operating subsidiaries except for the cash received from Marine Subsea & Consafe Ltd and TSMarine through a cash sweep mechanism anticipated to commence in Marine Subsea's third fiscal quarter of 2011.

Convertible Bonds - Payments

The holders in the Convertible Bond are similarly asked to accept a mandatory exchange of their bonds as at exchange date into a new senior secured USD denominated bond, called the Exchange Bond - Series II (refer to enclosed term sheets for Exchange Bond - Series I and Series II). Any accrued and unpaid interest on the Convertible Bonds as at the exchange date will be paid in cash (to the holder of the Exchange Bond - Series II for which the relevant Convertible Bonds were exchanged) on or before the first interest payment date (being three months after the exchange date) for the Exchange Bond - Series II. The Exchange Bond - Series II will not have any conversion rights, but will have a 10-year scheduled final maturity date and will pay a quarterly coupon of 9.00% per annum for the first two years and thereafter 12.00% per annum in cash or, during the first two years after issue, 12.00% per annum PIK in the event of a shortfall in Marine Subsea's cash flow and as further set out in the proposed terms and conditions of the Exchange Bond - Series II. As is the case with the Exchange Bond - Series I, the PIK feature will be a fixed mechanism (and not at Marine Subsea's discretion) only to be applied, or partially applied as the case may be, in the event that Marine Subsea, pursuant to the proposed terms and conditions of the Exchange Bond - Series II has insufficient cash to pay all or part of the interest coupon due. Interest on the Exchange Bond- Series I will be paid in priority to Exchange Bond Series II. Accordingly in the event of a cash shortfall during the first two years after issue, the Exchange Bond - Series II will PIK before Exchange Bond Series I. The Exchange Bond - Series II will be repaid through a cash sweep mechanism from cash in Marine Subsea received from Marine Subsea & Consafe Limited and TSMarine Subsea Limited. Once the Exchange Bond - Series I is fully repaid, the Exchange Bond - Series II will be repaid through a cash sweep mechanism from cash in Marine Subsea received from all its operating subsidiaries.

Expected Weighted Average Life

Notwithstanding their 10 year final maturity dates, the excess cash sweep mechanisms (post delivery of the Karianne vessel) of both Exchange Bond - Series I and Series II are expected under the base case financial forecasts in section 7 of the Information Memorandum, to result in a weighted average life of cash flows of the Exchange Bond - Series I and II of 4.3 years and 5.2 years respectively and both are expected to be fully redeemed by 2017.

Revised Security Package

The Exchange Bond - Series I will be secured over inter alia a second ranking mortgage in the Sarah and Karianne vessels (post delivery) governed by an inter-creditor agreement with the security trustee for the export-credit backed facilities (to become a first ranking mortgage once export-credit backed facilities are fully repaid), a first ranking claim over the residual proceeds of any enforcement of security in the Sarah and Karianne subsidiaries under the export-credit backed facilities, a second ranking mortgage and assignment of earnings in the Installer barge (to become a first ranking mortgage once released by Ulstein), a first ranking claim over the construction contract for the Lifter barge, a first ranking claim over the construction contract for the Worker barge, a first ranking mortgage and assignment of earnings in the Lifter barge (post delivery), a first ranking mortgage and assignment of earnings in the Worker barge (post delivery) and first ranking share pledges over the shares held by the Cyprus holding company in the subsidiaries owning the Installer (100%), Lifter (75%) and Worker (100%) barges. Accordingly the bondholders will not have a direct security interest over the Sarah and Karianne construction contracts, the shares in those subsidiaries nor any of their earnings. The existing security in place with respect to the Worker, Installer and Lifter barges are to be amended such that the form and substance of security is to be reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee.

4

NO RSK TILLITSM AN N ASA
The Exchange Bond - Series II will be,'$$cJUbSd'1&ver a first ranking share pledge over both Marine Subsea's 40% shareholding in Marine Subsea & Consafe Limited (owning the Safe Challenger crane ship) and Marine Subsea's future shareholdings in TSMarine Subsea Limited, which increases from 60% initially (5 days after closing of the Restructuring Plan) to 100% over 3 years, together with a first ranking claim over the shareholder loan to Marine Subsea & Consafe Limited.
The loan trustee for both series of Exchange Bonds will be Norsk Tillitsmann and their respective loan agreements will be subject to Norwegian law. The proposed term sheets for the Exchange Bond - Series I and Series II are contained in the enclosed term sheets for Exchange Bond - Series I and II.
Exchange
The exchange into the new Exchange Bonds - Series I and II is proposed to be implemented through the following mechanisms:
(i) The amount under the new Exchange Bond - Series I shall amount to the notional USD amount of all the FRNs on the Exchange Date at the ratio of 1.095:1 of par value for the February Bond and at the ratio of 0.923:1 of par value for the June Bond.
(ii) The amount under the new Exchange Bond - Series II shall amount to the USD equivalent amount of the Convertible Bonds calculated using the official USD/NOK fixing rate of exchange provided by the Norwegian Central Bank at close of business in Oslo on the day falling two business days prior to the Exchange Date;
(iii) the FRN bonds shall be spilt into 100,000 new bonds with a face value of USD 1; and (iv) the Convertible Bond shall be split into an amount of new bonds implying a face value of
USD 1 based on the USD/NOK fixing rate as described above.
As part of the process to achieve the Restructuring Plan, the Loan Trustee and its advisors are exploring with the Borrower the possibility of the Exchange Bond - Series I and Series II being issued (rather than by the Borrower) by a new borrower which would be a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the Borrower. In this event the Exchange Bond - Series I and Series II would maintain the terms and conditions contemplated herein, subject to conforming changes and possibly additional terms, including to the export-credit backed finance facilities, to ensure that a reasonable but appropriate level of funds can be transferred to the Borrower to meet its day to day expenses and other permitted expenditures. The approval of bondholders is therefore also being sought to such a change to the borrower where this is agreed by the Borrower, and the Loan Trustee (in consultation with Bingham McCutchen) considers that this change of borrower would be beneficial (or at least not detrimental) to bondholders.
2.2 Conditions and timetable
The proposed changes to the FRNs and Convertible Bonds will be subject to inter alia:
(i) Approval by the requisite majority of bondholders of each of the February Bond (ISIN NO 001 035359.2), the June Bond (ISIN NO001 037513.2) and the Convertible Bond (ISIN NO 001 039212.9), and a final agreed form of the Loan Agreement for the Exchange Bonds - Series I and Series II, all security documentation and any ancillary documents thereto.
(ii) Release of all necessary security and guarantees by Norsk Tillitsmann, acting for the holders of the February Bond (ISIN NO 001 035359.2), the June Bond (ISIN NO 001 037513.2) and the Convertible Bond (ISIN NO 001 039212.9), with relevant security to be subsequently secured for the benefit of the export credit lenders to satisfy the conditions precedent to drawdown of the Sarah and subsequently the Karianne exportcredit backed facilities;
(iii) Conversion and extinguishment of the FRN Bonds into Exchange Bond - Series I at the applicable exchange ratio; and
5

NO RSK TILLITSM AN N ASA
(iv) Conversion and extinguishWieilfbfthb'Convertible Bonds into Exchange Bond - Series II at the applicable exchange ratio and foreign exchange rate.
Closing will be designed so that (subject to all conditions precedent having been met or waived) the conversion and extinguishment of the FRN Bonds and Convertible Bonds, the release of all existing security and the entering into of the new security will automatically become effective at the moment of drawdown of the USD 111.0 million Sarah export-credit backed facility provided by Eksportfinans ASA and Standard Bank Pic as lenders under guarantees from Garanti-instituttet for eksportkreditt and Standard Bank Pic (which will occur substantially concurrently with the delivery of the Sarah vessel).
Please refer to Section 8 of the Information Memorandum for further details on the conditions precedent for drawdown of the Sarah and Karianne export-credit backed facilities. Once a date is identified upon which all conditions precedent to the Sarah and Karianne (where relevant) exportcredit backed facilities are capable of being satisfied, in form and substance satisfactory to Eksportfinans ASA and Standard Bank Pic, a date for drawdown of the Sarah facility will be determined between lenders and Marine Subsea. This date of drawdown will be communicated to Norsk Tillitsmann and shall become the exchange date for conversion and extinguishment of the FRN Bonds into Exchange Bond - Series I and the Convertible Bonds into Exchange Bond - Series II (subject to all conditions precedent having been met or waived) and the date of effectiveness for the related loan and security documentation.
The approval of the bondholders will also be subject to all conditions precedent having been met or waived and the drawdown of the Sarah facility having occurred on or before the 11th of December 2009.
2.3 Advisors
The Borrower has engaged Pareto Securities AS as the Borrower's financial advisor with respect to the Restructuring Plan. Accordingly, bondholders may contact Stian Winther (stian.winther@pareto.no / +47 22 87 87 73) or Thomas Wrede-Holm (thomas.wredeholm@pareto.no / +47 22 87 88 22) at Pareto Securities AS for further information.
Pareto Securities AS is acting solely for the Borrower and no-one else in connection with the Restructuring Plan. No due diligence investigations have been carried out by Pareto Securities AS with respect to the Borrower and Pareto Securities AS expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the Restructuring Plan lincluding but not limited to the information contained herein and in the Information Memorandum!,
The Loan Trustee has appointed AMA Capital Partners and Bingham McCutchen as independent advisors to assist and advise the Loan Trustee and the bondholders in the process of negotiating the Restructuring Plan with the Borrower.
2.4 Support from bondholders
Bondholders in the FRNs and the Convertible Bond have formed an ad hoc committee which has taken part in the discussions over the last months. AMA Capital Partners and Pareto Securities AS have collectively received informal indications from investors representing 56.1% in the February Bond, 54.5% in the June Bond, and 50.4% in the Convertible Bond of their intention to vote in favour of the Restructuring Plan set forth in this summons.
2.5 Borrower's evaluation of the Restructuring Plan
The Borrower has worked since late 2008 on securing the financing required in order to ensure its continued operation. In order to achieve this financing, the Board of Directors of the Borrower (the "Board") has no alternative but to ask for bondholder acceptance for the restructuring of Marine
6

N O RSK TILLITSM AN N ASA
Subsea's financial debt. The Board hdg'hbWfeVbrtdhdeavoured to achieve the following objectives through the restructuring:
(i) Full repayment of bondholders' principal and the continued payment of interest; (ii) Enhancement of bondholders' prospect of repayment by providing financing for the
completion and delivery of all vessels and barges; (iii) Matching of Marine Subsea's debt maturities with its projected cash flow generation
capacity; and (iv) Enabling the raising of new long-term financing to fully fund all existing projects to
completion and see the Borrower's assets become income producing and cash flow generative.

The Board believes that the Restructuring Plan being proposed is the best possible solution available for bondholders meeting all the objectives set out above. The Board is also pleased to have secured the full support from new financing institutions, construction yards, partners in Angola and most importantly Sonangol. Through the support and contribution of all involved parties, the Board is confident that this proposal will provide bondholders with the best possible outcome and therefore asks for bondholders support by approving the Restructuring Plan.

2.6 Non-reliance

Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the bondholders by any of the Loan Trustee, AMA Capital Partners, Bingham McCutchen, Eksportfinans ASA, Garanti-instituttet for eksportkreditt or Standard Bank Pic. Bondholders should independently evaluate the Restructuring Plan and vote accordingly.

2.7 Informational bondholder call

There will be an informational bondholder call at 16:00 hours (4 pm) (London time) on 14th October 2009 for any bondholder that wishes to participate and fulfils the conditions in this paragraph 2.7. Any bondholder who wishes to participate in this call will need to confirm their attendance by contacting Fiona Huntriss at Bingham McCutchen at fiona.huntriss@bingham.com. Each participating bondholder will also need to provide confirmation of its current holdings of bonds. Bondholders that have not provided this information and confirmed attendance by 5pm London time on the banking day before the call takes place will not be permitted to attend the call.

To approve the above resolution, bondholders representing at least 2/3 of the relevant series of Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the meeting must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to have a quorum, at least 5/10 of the voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting. If the proposal is not adopted, the Loan Agreements will remain unchanged.
Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS) ("Bondholder's Form"), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the Bondholder's Form - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in the Bondholder's Form on which the bonds are registered.)
The individual bondholder may authorise Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Norsk Tillitsmann to vote, must then be returned to Norsk Tillitsmann in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new bondholder must bring to the bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to Norsk Tillitsmann, to notify Norsk Tillitsmann by telephone or by email (at set out at the first page of this letter) by 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) on the banking day before the meeting takes place.

Excess Cash:

(i) An initial repayment on the later of the interest payment date:

a. falling during the Issuer's third financial quarter of 2011; or

b. falling at least six months after the Karianne vessel is operational;

All Excess Cash that is not required to be applied as a repayment of the Exchange Bond - Series II on an interest date on which the Excess Cash Sweep is to operate shall be carried forward to the next interest payment date on which the Excess Cash Sweep is to operate ("Carry Forward Excess Cash").

For the avoidance of doubt, the determination of Excess Cash will not include (a) cash flows up-streamed from Barge Subsidiaries, Other Subsidiaries or the Vessel Subsidiaries while the Exchange Bond - Series I remain outstanding, or (b) any new equity raised by the Issuer or otherwise contributed by shareholders for the purpose of funding working capital, future projects or capital expenditure.

The Issuer undertakes to procure that the Barge Subsidiaries, Other Subsidiaries, Vessel Subsidiaries and TSMarine Subsea Limited shall upstream all available cash on a quarterly basis unless (i) the amounts are de minimis, (ii) otherwise prohibited from being repatriated by way of local laws, exchange controls or government restrictions, (iii) dependent on the finalisation of annual audited financial statements for the payment of dividends or (iv) in the case of the Vessel Subsidiaries otherwise retained or prevented from being up-streamed pursuant to the terms of the Vessel Financings (including their minimum operating or debt service reserve accounts).
