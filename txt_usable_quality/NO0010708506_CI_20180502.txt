The Company's registered office is at Zwolseweg 1, 2994 LB, Barendrecht and has its legal seat in Rotterdam. The Company is registered at the Chamber of Commerce with registration number 58848754. These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively the `Group' and individually `Group companies') together operating as Veritas Petroleum Services Group. The Group primarily provides testing and survey services to the Maritime industry.
Veritas Petroleum Services Holding B.V. is the holding company of the Veritas Petroleum Services Group. The parents of the group are as per 31 December 2017 VPS International S.a.r.l. (95.15%) and VPS Management Holding B.V. (4.85%); the preference shares A held by DET Norske Veritas Holding AS as per 31 December 2016 have been repaid in 2017 and were cancelled subsequently.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared at the historical cost convention, except for the net defined benefit (asset) liability, which has been accounted for at fair value or the plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
These consolidated financial statements reflect all of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Group (See note 27 for an overview of the Group legal entities) and disclose all matters relevant to Veritas Petroleum Services B.V.'s ability to continue as a going concern. Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. has the intent and ability to undertake necessary precautions to continue on a going concern basis.
Details of the Group's accounting policies are included in Notes 5 and 6.
These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Company's board of directors on 19 April 2018.
Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of United States Dollars (USD), which is the Company's functional currency.

3. Use of judgements and estimates
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Group's accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Veritas Petroleum Services B.V., Rotterdam

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Estimated and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.
Critical estimates, judgements and errors The areas involving significant estimates or judgements are related to
o Note 14 - impairment test: key assumptions underlying recoverable amount
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the entity and that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Measurement of fair values A number of the Group's disclosures require the measurement of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows.
o Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. o Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e derived from prices). o Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable inputs).
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entire in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in:
o Note 14 - impairment test: key assumptions underlying recoverable amount; and o Note 20 - employee benefits: based on actuarial calculations.
4. Changes in accounting policies
Except for the changes below, the Group has consistently applied the accounting policies set out in Note 5 to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The Group has adopted the following new standards, amendments to a standard including any consequential amendments to other standards, and new interpretations with an effective date for annual periods beginning after or on 1 January 2017.
- IAS 7 Statement of Cashflows - Disclosure amendments
The IAS 7 disclosure amendments require additional disclosure of changes in liabilities arising from financing activities.
- IAS 12 Income Taxes - Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses amendments
The IAS 12 amendments give additional guidance on the assessment of the probability of future taxable profits and the nature of these future taxable profits.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Where relevant, the Group has applied the amendments to IAS 7 and IAS 12 that became effective in 2017. The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on the Company's financial performance or disclosures.

5. Significant accounting policies
The Group has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
Business combinations The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity instruments.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to influence those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
Transaction eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra group transactions, are eliminated.
Foreign currency
Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (`the functional currency'). The financial statements are presented in United States dollars which is the group's presentation currency and equals the functional currency.
Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement within finance income or cost.

Veritas Petroleum Services B.V., Rotterdam

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Group companies All the results and financial position of the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) are measured in the Group's functional currency.
Revenue
Rendering of services Main activity of the Group is performing services to the Maritime industry. The Group entered different type of billing arrangement with its customers. Revenue from rendering services as far as these are completed at the reporting date and when the transaction can be estimated reliable are recognised in profit or loss. Received amounts from service arrangements wherefore services are not completed at reporting date are recognised as deferred income.
Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, if there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured based on net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates.
Expenses Expenses arising from the company's business operations are accounted for as operating expenses in the year incurred. Losses originating before the end of the financial year are taken into account if they have become known before preparation of the financial statements.
Employee benefits The group operates various post-employment schemes, including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
Pension obligations A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.
For defined contribution plans, the group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
The Company's branch office in United Arab Emirates provides end of service benefits to its employees. The entitlement of these benefits is based upon the employees' final salary and length of service, subject to the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accounted for based on the Project Unit Credit Method (PUCM) over the period of employment.
Finance income and finance costs The group's finance income and finance costs include:
o Interest income; o Interest expenses; o Dividend income; o The net gain or loss on financial assets and financial liabilities; o Foreign currency translation.
Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss and the date on which the Group's right to receive payment is established.
Income tax Income tax expenses comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss for except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in Other Comprehensive Income.
Current tax Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustments to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.
Current tax assets and liabilities are only offset if certain criteria are met.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for:
o Temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and the affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
o Temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
o Taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Veritas Petroleum Services B.V., Rotterdam

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the group expects, at reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. For this purpose, the carrying amount of investment property measured at fair value is presumed to be recovered through sale, and the Group has not rebutted this resumption.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

Property, plant and equipment

Recognition and measurement Property, plant and equipment are non-current assets used in the operating activities of the Group with a useful life of over one year. An item of property, plant and equipment is initially recognised at its acquisition cost which consists of the purchase price and other expenditures directly related to the acquisition that are necessary for bringing the asset to its operating condition and location.

An item of property, plant and equipment is subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.

Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure incurred for an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as a non-current asset when it is probable that the Group will derive future economic benefits from it and its cost can be measured reliably.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within `Other expense & income' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Depreciation Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally recognised in `Depreciation, amortisation and impairment expenses' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Land is not depreciated.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years of significant items of Property, Plant and Equipment are as follows:

o Buildings o Equipment, fixtures and fittings

5 - 25 years 3 - 10 years

intangible assets and goodwill
Intangibles - Customer relationships Separately acquired customer relationships are shown at historical cost. Customer relationships in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Customer relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful lives with a maximum of 17 years.
Intangibles - Software Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
o it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use; o management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it; o there is an ability to use or sell the software product; o it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic
benefits; o adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or
sell the software product are available; and o the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably
measured
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, which does not exceed five years.
Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Financial instruments The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity financial assets, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category.

Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities - Recognition and de-recognition The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and debt securities issued on the date when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date.

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual right to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are transferred, or it neither transfers nor retains substantially all or the risk and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset. Any interest in such derecognised financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Financial asset available for sale

A financial asset is classified at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held-for-trading or designated as such on initial recognition. Directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Financial assets at fair value profit or loss are measured at fair value and changed therein, including any interest and dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss. These assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised costs using the effective interest method. These assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised costs using the effective interest method. These assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised through other comprehensive income.

Non-derivative financial liabilities - Measurement Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised costs using the effective interest method.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as share capital. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Share-based payment Selected managers of the group participate in Veritas Petroleum Services Holding B.V. ("the Company") through indirect share ownership via a management holding company. In relation with a change in control event, the shares will be settled in cash either by the majority shareholder or the acquirer. The Company or another group entity will under no circumstances be required to settle in cash. Accordingly, this arrangement is classified as an equity-settled share-based payment arrangement.
The Company determines the fair value of the shares at the grant date and recognises, if applicable, an expense for the services received over the service period with a corresponding increase in equity. Only if the purchase price is lower than the actual market value of the shares at the grant date, or if the selling price is above actual market value at the date of sale, this results in a fair value to be reported as a share-based payment expense.
Impairment of financial assets A financial asset is impaired if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. An assessment is made at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is objective evidence that a specified asset, or a group of similar assets, may be impaired. If such evidence exists any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount of an interest bearing instrument is determined based on the net present value of future cash flows discounted at original effective interest rates. Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on assets carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired debtors are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
Impairment of non-financial assets Non-financial assets, like property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The fair value less costs to sell is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm's length transaction, whilst value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
The discount rate used for value-in-use calculations is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to that asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement. Reversal of impairment losses recognised in prior years (other than goodwill) is recorded as income when there is an indication that the impairment losses recognised for the asset no longer exist or have decreased.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are amounts due from customers for products provided and services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets. Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents In the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the qualifying borrowing are added to the cost of the borrowing and amortised over the same period of the borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost, which is the amount received plus or minus any premium or discount, less transaction costs. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised as interest in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are obligations to pay for products and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Leases At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether the arrangements is or contains a lease.
At interception or on reassessment of an arrangement that contains a lease, the Group separates payments and other consideration required by the arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values.
If the Group concludes for a finance lease that is impracticable to separate the payments reliably, then an asset and liability are recognised at an amount equal to the fair value of underlying assets; subsequently, the liability is reduced as payments are made and an imputed finance cost on the liability is recognised using the group's incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of lease.
Cash flow statement The cash flow statement has been prepared using the indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. Corporate income taxes, issuance of share capital, interest received and dividends received are presented under the cash flow from operating activities. The bond loan, buy backs of the loan, interest paid and dividends paid are presented under the cash flow from financing activities. Acquisition of assets and the cost of group companies acquired is presented under the cash flow from investment activities, as far as payment has been made with cash and cash equivalents. The cash and cash equivalents of the group companies acquired are deducted from the purchase cost.

6. Standards issued but not yet adopted

A number of new standards and amendments to standards are issued but not yet mandatorily effective (but early adoption is allowed) for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2017; however, the Group has not applied the following new or amended standards in preparing these financial statements.

New or amended standards IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

Summary of the requirements
IFRS 9, published in July 2014, replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financials instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and the new general hedge accounting requirements. It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from IAS 39. IFRS 9 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 2018, with early adoption permitted.

Possible impact on consolidated financial statements
The Group has assessed the impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from application of IFRS 9.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting, as such there is no impact due to the new hedge accounting requirements as reflected in IFRS 9.
All financial instruments of the Group are carried at amortised cost which would not change when performing the "solely payments of principal and interest" test and assessing the business model in accordance with IFRS 9. The Group has determined the impairment loss of receivables by applying the expected credit loss model. Considering historical information the Group determined the historical payment profile per region, resulting in different expected credit losses per region and ageing category.

Summary of the requirements

Possible impact on consolidated financial statements
Based on the assessments undertaken amongst which projecting the expected credit loss model on the outstanding receivables as per balance sheet date 31 December 2017, the Group expects no material impact on the allowance for impairment on trade and other receivables.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers

IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. IFRS 15, is based on the principle that revenue is recognized when a control of a good or service transfers to a customer. A customer obtains control when it has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the good or service. IFRS 15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted. The standard permits either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption.

The Group will apply IFRS 9 retrospectively from 1 January 2018, with the practical expedients permitted under the standard and will not restate the comparative amounts for the year prior to first adoption. The Group has assessed the impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from application of IFRS 15. The assessment includes the Group's revenue categories rendering of services and sale of goods, and considered the impact of critical judgements in determining the performance obligations, the respective price and the timing of recognition of revenues. Based on the assessments undertaken, the Group expects no material impact on the recognition of revenues in the Company's financial statements.
The Group will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach which means that the cumulative impact of the adoption will be recognized in retained earnings as of January 1, 2018 and comparative amounts will not be restated, and it will apply IFRS 15 to new contracts and not completed contract as of that date.

New or amended standards IFRS 16 Leases

Summary of the requirements

Possible impact on consolidated financial statements

IFRS 16 establishes principles for the

recognition,

measurement,

presentation and disclosure of leases,

with the objective of ensuring that

lessees and lessors provide relevant

information that faithfully represents

those transactions. IFRS 16 will

supersede IAS 17 and require almost all

leases to be on the balance sheet of

lessees and introduces a single income

statement model which basically treats

all leases as finance leases. IFRS 16 is

effective for annual reporting periods

beginning on or after 1 January 2019,

with early adoption permitted if IFRS 15

Revenue from Contracts with

Customers has also been applied.

The Group is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from application of IFRS 16.
The Group intends to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach, which means that the initial cumulative impact of the adoption, if any, will be recognized in retained earnings as of that date and, therefore, the comparative figures will not be restated.

The following new or amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact of the Group's consolidated financial statements.
o Accounting for acquisitions of an interest in a joint operation (Amendments to IFRS 11) o Application of the consolidation exception (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12, IAS 28) o IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts o Disclosure initiative (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 7) o Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation (Amendments to IAS 16
and IAS 38) o Reinstating the equity method as an accounting option for investments in subsidiaries, joint
ventures and associates in an entity's separate financial statements (Amendments to IAS 27) o IAS 41 Agriculture: Bearer Plants (Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41) o Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 cycle (Amendments to IFRS 5, IAS 19 and IAS 34) o Transfers of Investment Property (Amendments to IAS 40) o Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (Amendments to IFRS 2)

The deferred tax asset includes the carry-forward losses for Norway. The utilisation of the deferred tax asset is dependent on future taxable profits.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items, because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised by the Group. The unused tax losses and potential tax benefit are as follows:

B. Impairment of goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, the total amount of goodwill is allocated to its cash generating unit Veritas Petroleum Services Group. The recoverable amount of this CGU was based on fair value less cost of disposal, estimated using discounted cash flows.
The key assumptions used in the estimation of the recoverable amount are set out below. The values assigned to the key assumptions represent management's assessment of future trends in the marine fuel market and have been based on historical data from both internal and external resources.
Key assumptions
Pre-tax cash flow projections in the fair value less costs of disposal calculation are mainly dependent on the development of the revenue growth rate. Management estimates the assumptions based on the past performance, expected general market developments and potentials in the market. The management key assumptions over a 5-year (2016: 4-year) forecast period can be specified as follows:

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
The Company's expected growth will be supported by offering our existing services to new markets, the introduction of new services and introducing innovative services to provide additional tests on existing samples. Budgeted EBITDA was estimated taking into account past experience, adjusted as follows.
o Revenue growth was projected taking into account the average growth levels experienced within the Maritime Industry and expected growth in new services.
o Significant one-off (post) acquisition, refinance and organisational restructuring costs are excluded from budgeted EBITDA.
The Company will focus on cost efficiency projects and invest in laboratory equipment to facilitate efficiencies and new services. By introducing new services, investment in new and existing equipment and focus on (new) business development, management aims to increase the market share in the next five years.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate and terminal value growth rate are as follows:

fap&roipnt D iscount rate Term inal value gro w th

2018 - 2022 9.50 2.CMK

2017 - 2020 11.o ra 2 .o ra

The discount rate was a post-tax measure estimated based on the observable Maritime industry weighted-average cost of capital. The terminal growth rate was determined based on management's estimate of the long-term compound annual EBITDA growth rate, consistent with the assumption that a market participant would make.

The impairment analysis in 2017 did not result in an impairment. The recoverable amount less cost of disposal of CGU being USD 177 million exceeded its carrying amount of USD 120 million by USD 57 million (headroom).
Sensitivity analysis
Management has identified that a deviation in key assumptions could lead to a carrying amount exceeding the recoverable amount. The following table shows a sensitivity (percentage point change per key assumption) resulting in a headroom of nil:

In percentage point Discount rate Terminal value growth rate Revenue growth rate EBITDA for the projection period

Furthermore, management calculated a sensitivity based on movements of these key assumptions. The impact on the headroom can be specified as follows:

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Unsecured bond loan The Group issued on 1 April 2014 an unsecured bond loan for in total USD 70 million of which the proceeds have been used for a repayment on the shareholders loan of USD 75 million. The total unsecured bond loan amount is divided in 350 coupons with a face value of USD 200,000 each, which ranks pari passu between themselves. By issuing the bond loan, the Group entered into a bond agreement with its bond holders which stipulates certain (financial) requirements to be met (See also Note 24). The issued unsecured bond loan on the Oslo Stock Exchange has been listed per 4 February 2016. A compliance certificate is submitted on a quarterly basis starting per 31 March 2016.
In January 2017 the bond terms have been amended retrospectively to enable to incur extra "exceptional items" necessary to grow the Company through acquisitions and cost improvement initiatives. The difference of USD 37 thousand due to reassessing the future cash flows is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Unsecured Shareholders loan The Group borrowed an initial loan of USD 75 million of its shareholder which has been partly repaid in 2014. The loan bears an annual interest of 10% which are capitalised to the outstanding amount on an annual basis. The remainder of the loan will be repaid in financial year 2023 or earlier upon a partly disposal of the shareholders interest.
Information about the Group's exposure to fair values, interest rate, foreign currency and liquidity risk is included in Note 24.

Since the number of participants in Norway is limited, any risk associated with the post employment defined benefit plans is considered limited. The Group has no further obligation other than the annual contribution to the Norwegian pension provider.
Employees' end-of-service benefits (Plan B) The Company provides its employees an end-of service benefit (Plan B) for which a provision is provided. Any movement in the provision is recognised in statement of profit or loss. The following were the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date used for employees' end-of-service benefit calculation based on the Project Unit Credit Method:

23. Capital management
The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders over the longer term and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. Reference is made to Note 24 regarding management the Company's capital on basis of the gearing ratio covenant.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group does currently not pay dividends under its financing agreements and the Group strives to retain sound solvency and liquidity levels.

24. Financial instruments
Risk management framework The Company's board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. In 2017 a risk control framework is developed and a risk assessment has been performed. The risk control framework will be finalized in 2018. Based on the identified business and financial risks, internal controls are being identified and documented and will subsequently be tested to evaluate the design and implementation of such internal controls. In addition, Group's risk management policies will be documented and monitored. The Compliance manager will report regularly to the board of directors on his activities.

The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse risk faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risk adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of risk control framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to a large number of customer contracts which are unrelated. Therefore the Group believes that no additional credit risk provision is required besides the normal provision for bad debt.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

Trade and other receivables The Group established an allowance for impairment that reflects its estimate of incurred losses in respect of the indicated credit risks regarding trade receivables. For the sales occurred during 2017, the credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate. Further details of concentration of revenue are included in Note 7.

A credit policy has been established where each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group's standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group reviews external ratings, if they are available, and in some cases bank references. For all new customers a creditworthiness check is performed and for existing customers the creditworthiness is reviewed on a yearly basis.

At 31 December 2017, the maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables by geographic region was as follows.

Cash and Cash equivalents The Group held cash and cash equivalents of USD 15,669 thousand at 31 December 2017 (2016: USD 12,721 thousand). The cash and cash equivalents are held by bank counter parties, which are rated AA-, based on Standard & Poor's ratings.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation.
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a cash flow forecast model. This model considers the maturity of both its non-current and current assets and liabilities (trade receivables and other financial assets or liabilities) and projected cash flows from operations.
The Group aims to maintain the level of its cash and cash equivalents at an amount in excess of expected cash outflows on financial liabilities (other than trade payables over the next 60 days). The Group also monitors the level of expected cash inflows on trade and other receivables together with expected cash outflows on trade and other payables.
At 31 December 2017, the expected cash flows from trade and other receivables maturing within two months were USD 4,482 thousand (2016: USD 4,756 thousand). This excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.
Exposure to liquidity risk The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are gross and undiscounted, and include estimated interest payments and exclude the impact of netting agreements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
The unsecured bond loan is expiring on March 31st 2019. The expiry date of the unsecured bond loan within the twelve month period of the Group's cashflow forecast model is monitored closely. Based on the Group's financial position, its underlying performance and its market expectation, the Group is confident to refinance the unsecured bond loan with a new bond loan upon its expiry date or that the Group is able to attract alternative debt financing. The Group consequently considers no material exposure to liquidity risk with regards to the expiry date of the publicly listed (bullet) bond loan on March 31st 2019.
The Group's unsecured bond loan contains loan covenants. A future breach of covenants may require the Group to repay the loan earlier than indicated in the above table. Under the agreement, the covenants are monitored on a regular basis by the Group finance team and regularly reported to the management to ensure compliance with the agreement.
As a result the Group monitors its liquidity (minimum of USD 5 million) as well as its capital on the basis of the gearing ratio covenant as part of the bond agreement. This ratio is calculated as net interest bearing debt divided by EBITDA. Net interest bearing debt is calculated as total aggregated loans and borrowings less shareholder loans and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. The EBITDA is calculated as `earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and before exceptional items'. The covenant includes a maximum gearing ratio of 4.5 per end of 2017. Per 31 December 2017, the Group complied with all quarterly and annual covenant requirements.
The interest payments on the shareholders loan and bond issues in the table above are based on interest rates as disclosed in note 19. In addition, the interest rate of the shareholders loan will be accrued for and for that reason a cash outflow at repayment date. It is not expected that cash flows included in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier or at significant different amounts.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. The Group is closely monitoring the world economy as the Group's sales is depending on the developments in marine fuel market.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales, purchases and borrowings are denominated and the respective functional currencies of Group companies. The functional currency of the Group is US dollar. The currencies in which these transactions are primarily denominated are US dollar, Euro, Singapore Dollar, United Arab Emirates Dirham and Norwegian Krone.
The group's borrowings are denominated in US dollar that match the cash flow generated by the underlying operations of the Group - primarily in US dollar. In addition, interest on borrowings is denominated in the currency of the borrowing. This provides an economic hedge without derivatives being entered into and therefore hedge accounting is not applied in these circumstances.

Sensitivity analysis A reasonably expected possible strengthening (weakening) of the Euro (EUR), Singapore dollar (SGD), United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED) or Norwegian Krone (NOK) against the United States Dollar (USD) versus the rates per 31 December 2017 would affect the measurement of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and effect profit or loss by the amounts shown below.

Interest rate risk The Group's interest exposure is nil as all its borrowings are at a fixed rate. In addition, the Group's policy is not to enter borrowing agreements with a floating rate.

25. Commitments
Leases as lessee The Group leases a number of offices and laboratory facilities under operating leases. The leases typically run for a period between five and ten years, with an option to renew these leases after that date. Lease payments are renegotiated at the end of the lease period to reflect the market rentals. Some leases provide additional rent payments that are based on changes in local price indices. For certain operating leases, the Group is restricted from entering into any sub-lease arrangements. The offices and laboratory lease were entered into pre-acquisition which is three years ago as combined lease of land and buildings. The Group determined that the land and building elements of the offices and laboratories leases are operating leases.
The rent paid to the landlord is adjusted to market rentals at regular intervals, and the Group does not have an interest in the residual value of the land and building elements of the offices and laboratories. As a result, it was determined that substantially all the risks and rewards of the land and building elements of the offices and laboratories are with the landlord.
Furthermore, the Group has liabilities relating to operating leases for cars provided to employees, each lease having a term of up to four years.
Future minimum lease payments At 31 December 2017, the future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable leases were payable as follows.

28. Events after balance sheet date
Establishment of new subsidiary
In January 2018 Transoil Laboratory Holding Ltd, a 100% subsidiary of Veritas Petroleum Services B.V., has been established for the purpose of the acquisition of Transoil Laboratory Ltd.
Acquisition of new shareholders loan
In January 2018 Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. obtained a new unsecured 5.7% interest-bearing shareholders loan from Veritas Petroleum Services Holding B.V. of USD 3.5 million and provided a 5.7% interest-bearing shareholders loan to Transoil Laboratory Holding Ltd of GBP 5.3 million for the purpose of the acquisition of Transoil Laboratory Ltd through the newly established subsidiary Transoil Laboratory Holding Ltd.
Acquisition of new subsidiary
On 31 January 2018, Transoil Laboratory Holding Ltd based in London, United Kingdom, acquired 100% of the shares in Transoil Laboratory Ltd based in Manchester, United Kingdom.
Transoil Laboratory Ltd is a transformer and insulating oil testing company; the acquisition enables Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. to expand its testing and advisory service offering into power industries.
The fair value of the consideration transferred at acquisition date for the acquisition of the shares in Transoil Laboratory Ltd is GBP 7.5 million (approximately USD 10.7 million) plus a payment for the net working capital in excess of what has been agreed (GBP 0.3 million) of which GBP 0.5 million (approximately USD 0.7 million) is deferred to 31 December 2018 and is subject to the continued employment of key personnel (not being the former owner) and the operational growth throughout financial year 2018. The Group's expectation is to pay the full amount of the deferred purchase price.
The fair value of the acquired net assets and liabilities is GBP 0.6 million. An initial Purchase Price Allocation (hereafter "PPA") has been performed showing the following outcome. The Brandname of Transoil Laboratory is valued at GBP 0.2 million, Transoil Laboratory's Customer Relationships at GBP 2.6 million and deferred tax liabilities have been determined with regards to the identified intangible fixed assets of GBP 0.5 million based on the applicable tax rate in the United Kingdom of 19%. The goodwill is, based on the initial PPA, consequently valued at GBP 5.0 million at acquisition date and will be revalued yearly at 31 December to the Company's functional currency in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU).
The business of Transoil Laboratory is complementary to the services of the Group. Substantial synergies are expected to be realised on the level of Transoil Laboratory, as well as on the level of the Company. Based on the available cashflow forecasts, the Group deems the goodwill determined based on the initial PPA, recoverable.
The acquired receivables, as part of the acquired assets, mainly consist of trade receivables for which the Group estimates its fair value in line with the carrying amount given the short-term character of the receivables and expects all of the receivables to be collected.

Notes to the Company financial statements

29. General
The Company financial statements are part of the 2017 financial statements of Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. For setting the principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and determination of the result for its company financial statements, Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. makes use of the option in Section 2:362 (8) of Part 9 of the Dutch Civil Code. This means that the principles for recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and determination of the result for the Company financial statements of Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. are the same as those for the consolidated financial statements. In this context, investments in companies in which significant control is exercised are measured according to the equity method.

30. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the International Accounting Standards Boards (IASB) and endorsed by the European Union and with Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. For a description of these accounting principles, reference is made to the accounting principles within the consolidated financial statements (see Note 5). The share in the result of subsidiaries in which the company has holdings comprises the share of Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. in the result of the subsidiaries. Results on transactions in which transfer of assets and liabilities has occurred between Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its subsidiaries, and mutually between subsidiaries which each other, are not recognised insofar as these can be considered as not realised.

31. Significant accounting policies
These are the same as for the consolidated financial statements. In addition, the equity method is applied for the investments in consolidated subsidiaries based on the parent company's accounting policies.

Share capital The authorised share capital consists of 63,000,000 ordinary shares par value USD 0.10 whereof the issued and paid-in capital amounts to USD 6,300,000.
Share premium The issued shares, in total 63,000,000 shares were priced against USD 1.00 per share. Additional paid-in capital of USD 56,700,000 has been recognised as share premium which is free distributable.
Retained earnings The amount in retained earnings is in principle available for profit sharing among the shareholders as far as its balance is positive per end of reporting date. In respect to this, following the bond agreement the Company could restrict the availability of retained earnings for profit sharing as financial covenant stipulations are not met.
Proposal for net result appropriation The board of directors proposes to add the current year net loss of USD 316 thousand to the accumulated losses.
Legal reserve for subsidiaries The legal reserve represents a foreign currency translation reserve in a foreign Group's subsidiary which is legally attached to this subsidiary. As the Group accounting policy regarding foreign currency is to recognise foreign currency translation differences in profit or loss, this amount is not accounted for in the foreign currency translation reserve.
Share-based payment Selected managers of the group have been given the opportunity to acquire the economic ownership over ordinary A shares of Veritas Petroleum Services Holding B.V. This share participation arrangement is classified as an equity-settled share-based payment arrangement.
If a participating manager is leaving the group prior to a change in control event, the leaving manager is obliged to sell and transfer the shares to the majority shareholder.

The basisfo r our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the section `Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We are independent of Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. in accordance with the European Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public interest entities, the `Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties'(Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the `Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten' (ViO - Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence requirements in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the `Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA - Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to rules of professional conduct).
Our audit approach Overview and context
Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its group of companies offer a wide range of fuel management services, focusing on fuel quality testing and bunker quantity surveys. The group is comprised of several components and therefore we considered our group audit scope and approach as set out in the section `The scope of our group audit'. We paid specific attention to the areas of focus driven by the operations of the Group, as set out below.
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made important judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. In paragraph 3, of the financial statements, the company describes the areas ofjudgment in applying accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty. Given the significant estimation uncertainty and the related higher inherent risks of material misstatement in the impairment assessment of goodwill, we considered it to be key audit matter as set out in the section `Key audit matters' of this report.
Other areas of focus, that were not considered to be key audit matters were revenue recognition, accuracy of accrued and deferred revenue, and the unsecured bond loan including the compliance with debt covenants. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by management that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included the appropriate skills and competences, which are needed for the audit of a provider of fuel quality testing services and bunker quantity surveys. We therefore included specialists in the areas of IT and valuations in our team.

The outline of our audit approach was as follows:

M ateriality



Overall materiality: USD 474,000, which represents 1% of the total

revenue.

Audit scope



We conducted audit work on five components.



Four components were subject to audits of their complete set of

financial information (`full scope audit') and were audited by teams

based in the Netherlands and Singapore.



For the remaining component, specific audit procedures have been

performed in order to increase our audit coverage on some financial

statements line items.



Audit coverage: 100% of consolidated revenue, 99% of consolidated

total assets and 99% of consolidated profit before tax.

Key audit matters  Valuation of goodwill

Materiality
The scope of our audit is influenced by the application of materiality which is further explained in the section `Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements'.

Based on our professional judgment, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality,

including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below.

These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and to

evaluate the effect of identified misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial

statements as a whole and on our opinion.

We have applied this benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, based on

our analysis of the common information needs of users of the financial statements.

The company has a relatively fixed cost base up to a certain level of activities given

the nature of those activities. The financial performance is therefore mainly reflected

through the company's revenue developments. This results in the company's revenue

being a significant determining factor for the EBITDA. Based on the aforementioned

and our understanding of the key stakeholders we determined revenue to be the

appropriate benchmark.

To each component in our audit scope, we, based on our judgement, allocate

materiality that is not higher than our overall group materiality.

The range of materiality allocated across components was between USD 330,000

and USD 474,000.

Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. - 6ANXDW4YMZQ3-1743498477-123 Page 3 of 9

pwc

We also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgement, are material for qualitative reasons.

We agreed with management that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above USD 23,700 (2016: USD 24,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
The scope o f our group audit
Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. is the parent company of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Veritas Petroleum Services B.V.
The Group's accounting process is structured around a local finance function in each of the three regions ("Europe", "Americas" and "Africa, Middle East & Asia") in which the Group operates through four components besides the parent entity. These functions maintain their own accounting records and controls and report to the head office finance team in the Netherlands through an integrated consolidation system.

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Group, the nature of operations of its components, the accounting processes and controls, and the markets in which the components of the Group operate.

In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work required to be performed at the component level by the group engagement team and by each component auditor.
Four components, including the parent company, were subject to audits of their complete set of financial information, as those components are individually significant to the Group. The other three components are: Veritas Petroleum Services Asia Pte. Ltd, Veritas Petroleum Services Europe B.V. and VPS Testing & Inspection Inc. We further performed audit procedures of specific account balances at Veritas Petroleum Services AS in order to obtain sufficient coverage of specific financial statement line items in the consolidated financial statements.

In total, in performing these procedures, we achieved the following coverage on the financial line items:

Revenue Total assets Profit before tax

100% 99% 99%

The group engagement team performed the audit procedures for all components, except for the taxation of Veritas Petroleum Services Asia Pte. Ltd. For this entity, a component auditor was involved.

Where the component auditor performed the work, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their audit work to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.

Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. - 6ANXDW4YMZQ3-1743498477-123 Page 4 of 9

JL
pwc

By performing the procedures above at components, combined with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on the Group's financial information, as a whole, to provide a basis for our opinion on the financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to management. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters that were identified by our audit and that we discussed. In this section, we described the key audit matters and included a summary of the audit procedures we performed on those matters.

The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon. We do not provide separate opinions on these matters or on specific elements of the financial statements. Any comments or observations we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context.

Due to the nature of the company's activities we recognize that the key audit matter which we reported in our independent auditor's report on the financial statements 2016 is continuing to be significant in the audit of the financial statements and therefore may not change significantly year over year. As compared to prior year, there have been no changes in key audit matters.

In addition to the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon, the annual report contains other information that consists of:  the directors' report;  the other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code;

Based on the procedures performed as set out below, we conclude that the other information:  is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements;  contains the information that is required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained in our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements.

By performing our procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of such procedures was substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.

Management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the directors' report and the other information in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

Responsibilitiesfor thefinancial statements and the audit
Responsibilities o f management
Management is responsible for:  the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS
and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and for  such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going-concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.
Our responsibilitiesfor the audit o f thefinancial statements
Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance which makes it possible that we may not detect all misstatements. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.

Appendix to our auditor's report on thefinancial statements 2017 o f Veritas Petroleum Services B.V.
In addition to what is included in our auditor's report we have further set out in this appendix our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves.
The auditor's responsibilitiesfo r the audit o f thefinancial statements
We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Our audit consisted, among other things of the following:  Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control.  Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control.  Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.  Concluding on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.  Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the company's consolidated financial statements we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary.

We communicate with management regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect we also issue an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with Article n of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report. We provide management with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with management, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.
