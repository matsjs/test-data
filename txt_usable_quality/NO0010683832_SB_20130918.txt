2. PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE BOND AGREEMENT
In accordance with Clause 16.2 of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer has approached the Bond Trustee to convene a Bondholders' Meeting for the Bonds in order to consider the Issuer's request to allow the Tap Issue and amend the Bond Agreement accordingly, pursuant to the authority given to the Bondholders' Meeting under Clause 16.1 of the Bond Agreement.
Specifically, the Issuer proposes that the Bond Agreement is amended and restated to reflect the following key (not exhaustive) changes (the "Proposal"):
(i) that the loan amount is increased to USD 350 million through a tap issue;
(ii) that the Issuer and borrower under the Bond Agreement is replaced with Latina Offshore (current Guarantor under the Bond Agreement);
(iii) that the Issuer (Santa Maria RigCo) together with Covadonga Rigco provide guarantees (on demand guarantees and for the full amount under the Bond Issue and Tap Issue) for the Bond Issue and the Tap Issue;
(iv) that the Security Interests are expanded and amended to include also Rig 2, La Covadonga, and related assets and interests;
(v) that the covenants and undertakings in the Bond Issue are expanded and amended to include Rig 2, La Covadonga, and the new corporate group structure;
(vi) that, in light of the new asset base, the financial covenants will apply on Latina Offshore level on a consolidated basis and be further amended to reflect (x) a minimum liquidity requirement of USD 10 million, and (y) a minimum equity ratio of 25% in the period from settlement of the Tap Issue until and including 31 December 2014; 27.5% in the period 1 January 2015 until and including 31 December 2015; and 30% thereafter; and
(vii) that Bonds shall be repaid pro rata as follows: (x) USD 8,750,000 on 3 January 2015; (y) USD 15,000,000 on each Interest Payment Date (semi-annually) commencing on 3 July 2015; and (z) the remaining outstanding amount at the Final Maturity Date (all at 100% of par value (plus accrued unpaid interest on redeemed amount).
(viii) such further ancillary amendments to reflect (i) through (vii) above.
The above referred changes are the key changes proposed. For a complete overview of the proposed amendments, please see attached as Schedule B an indicative term sheet for the Tap Issue and the new, amended bond issue terms and Schedule C which provides a comparison against the final term sheet for the existing Bond Issue. The Issuer advises that all Bondholders review these documents carefully.
In addition to approval by the Bondholders, implementation of the Proposal is subject to, and will only be effected upon, the successful placing of the Tap Issue and fulfillment of the conditions precedent for settlement thereof. These conditions precedents are included in the Tap Issue term sheet attached as Schedule B hereto, and includes inter alia (i) no potential or actual Event of Default existing; (ii) the Proposal having been duly approved by the necessary majority of Bondholders, and the amended and restated Bond Agreement having been duly executed by the parties thereto; (iii) corporate resolutions;

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
(iv) the Pre-Settlement Security Documents (as defined therein) being executed and perfected; and (v) payment of at least the Minimum Equity Amount as defined therein.

If these conditions are fulfilled, the Proposal will be sought implemented by way of a restated Bond Agreement being entered into between the Bond Trustee, on behalf of the holders of the Existing Bond and the subscribers in the Tap Issue (the "Amended and Restated Bond Agreement"), such Amended and Restated Bond Agreement to reflect the above and ancillary amendments.

3. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL / CONDITIONS

In the Issuer's opinion, the Proposal represents an attractive solution for the Bondholders. It will give a larger bond (USD 350 million v. original size of USD 175 million), which may be beneficial from a pricing and liquidity perspective. The expansion of the asset base and security package to two rigs increases Bondholders' security and decreases operational risk.

In addition to approval by the Bondholders, implementation of the Proposal remains subject to the successful placing of the Tap Issue and fulfillment of the relevant conditions precedent for settlement thereof. The Issuer will notify the Bondholders through the Bond Trustee and/or Stamdata.no once the placement of the Tap Issue is completed and closed.

The Issuer explicitly reserves its rights, in the Issuer's sole discretion, to not move forward with the Proposal if the result o f the Tap Issue placement is not satisfactory.

The Issuer has informed the Bond Trustee that Bondholders representing more than 2/3 of the outstanding Bonds have granted their pre-approval to the Proposal and have committed to vote in favor of the Proposal in the Bondholders' meeting.

4. NON-RELIANCE

The Proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee, and the Bond Trustee emphasizes that each Bondholder should cast its vote in the Bondholders' meeting based on its own evaluation of the Proposal. Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the Proposal is acceptable and vote accordingly. The Bond Trustee urges each Bondholder to seek advice in order to evaluate the Proposal.

The Rigs:

(i) The offshore jack-up Keppel FELS Mod V-B drilling rig named La Santa Maria, constructed at Keppel FELS in Singapore (the "Yard") and registered in the Panamanian Ship Registry and with international call

Delivery Date: Construction Contract: Drilling Contracts:

sign 3FNV4 ("Rig #1") delivered to Santa Maria Rigco on the scheduled delivery date 31 July 2013; and
(ii) the offshore jack-up Keppel FELS Mod V-B drilling rig identified as Hull No. B-338, to be named "La Covadonga" ("Rig #2", and together with Rig #1, the "Rigs"), which is under construction at the Yard pursuant to the Construction Contract. Rig #2 shall be registered in the Panamanian Ship Registry and delivered to Covadonga Rigco on the Delivery Date.
The date on which the title to Rig #2 is transferred from the Yard to Covadonga Rigco (the "Delivery Date") in accordance with the terms of the Construction Contract, with all relevant equipment properly owned and installed on such date. The Delivery Date is currently scheduled to be on 30 November 2013.
The construction contract dated 29 April 2011 (as amended from time to time) made between Covadonga Rigco and the Yard for the construction of Rig #2 (the "Construction Contract") against payment of a total consideration of USD 192,000,000, with 20% of the contract price already having been paid and 80% of the contract price being payable on the Delivery Date, and USD 1,000,000 being payable within 15 days of acceptance of Rig #2 under the initial Drilling Contract.
The Rigs may during the term of the Bond be operating under one or more drilling contracts (each a "Drilling Contract") with clients in different jurisdictions (each a "Client").
The main strategy is however to secure long term Drilling Contracts for the Rigs with PEMEX Exploracion y Produccion ("Pemex") in Mexico in order to optimize the capabilities and competitive edge of the Rigs and the Parent.
The Issuer shall procure that a Drilling Contract is only entered into if (i) the Client is an internationally reputable oil company and (ii) the Client's drilling operations or jurisdiction of incorporation is not any of Iran, North Korea, Venezuela or any other jurisdiction which is on any applicable United Nations, European Union or the United States of America's sanctions list.
The Parent has received a letter from Pemex dated 30 May 2013, confirming an intention to enter into a seven-year Drilling Contract at a day-rate of approximately USD 158,000 related to Rig #1. Pemex has after this date continued its internal approval processes for awarding a seven-year Drilling Contract for both Rigs at a day-rate of approximately USD 158,000, and the Parent expect a final Pemex approval of such Drilling Contracts on 13 October 2013.
It is anticipated that Drilling Contracts with Pemex will be entered into by the Parent as the contractual party towards Pemex, based on the offers made by the Parent to Pemex and the communications with and approvals by Pemex as described above. The Parent will secure the availability of the Rigs from the Rigcos through the Bareboat Charter Contracts (as defined below).
However, after the initial Drilling Contracts with Pemex are secured, the Parent undertakes to request and use its reasonable best endeavours to

obtain consent from Pemex to novate the said Drilling Contracts from the Parent to the respective Rigcos (or wholly-owned Mexican subsidiaries thereof), and the Parent shall with respect to future Drilling Contracts (whether with Pemex or not), use its reasonable best endeavours to permit that such Drilling Contracts are entered into directly by the respective Rigcos (or their wholly owned subsidiaries in the relevant jurisdiction) (referred to as the "Direct Rigco Contract Regime"). If required by the Client under the Direct Rigco Contract Regime, the Parent shall provide the Client with a performance guarantee in such form and substance as reasonably requested by the Client. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing prior to any implementation of the Direct Rigco Contract Regime for any of the Rigs, including details of the terms of the new Drilling Contract and the Operational Management Agreement (as defined below).

Any different structure than described above may be applied if required for tax or operational purposes in the relevant jurisdiction, provided that the bondholders will obtain a position with respect to the Security which is no less favourable to the bondholders than as contemplated herein.

Bareboat Charter Contracts:

The bareboat charter contracts to be entered into between the Parent as charterer and each of the Rigcos as the owners of each of the Rigs (the "Bareboat Charter Contracts") when a Drilling Contract is entered into through the Parent as contractual party thereunder, such Bareboat Charter Contracts to be entered into on main terms as are set out in Appendix 1 hereto.

In the event the Direct Rigco Contract Regime is implemented for any of the Rigs, the relevant Bareboat Charter Contract shall be terminated. Simultaneous with such termination becoming effective, an Operational Management Agreement shall come into force between the relevant Rigco and the Parent (or a third party manager) with respect to provision of marketing and operational management for the relevant Rig.

Construction Management Agreement:

An agreement entered into between Parent and GL Noble Denton to plan, supervise and manage the construction of Rig #2 (the "Construction Management Agreement") as described in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum.

Pre-Operational Management Agreements:

In conjunction with delivery of Rig #2 and in the period between the Delivery Date and until the first payment is received from the Client under a Drilling Contract for Rig #2, the Parent shall be engaged by Covadonga Rigco as pre operational manager under a separate pre-operational management agreement ("Rig #2 Pre-Operational Management Agreement").

The Rig #2 Pre-Operational Management Agreement shall be based on the current and continuing regime established for Rig #1, where a pre operational management agreement came into force in conjunction with delivery of Rig #1 (the "Rig #1 Pre-Operational Management Agreement" and together with the Rig #2 Pre-Operational Management Agreement the "Pre-Operational Management Agreements").

The Rig #2 Pre-Operational Management Agreement shall be entered into between the Parent and Covadonga Rigco prior to the Delivery Date,
6

providing for the Parent's responsibility as manager for arranging mobilization, import and commissioning of Rig #2 in order for it to be ready and accepted under the relevant Drilling Contract, as well as the first operations under such Drilling Contract.

The Parent shall incur costs under the Rig #2 Pre-Operational Management Agreements on reimbursable basis (with no markup), and based on a budget described in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, section 5.7 (the "Rig #2 Pre-Operational Costs"). Said Rig #2 Pre-Operational Costs inter alia include certain items payable in conjunction with (and to some extent prior to) delivery and heavy-lift transportation, as well as operational expenses related to Rig #2 for the period from acceptance of Rig #2 under the initial Drilling Contract until the first payment is received from the Client under said initial Drilling Contract. The Rig #2 Pre-Operational Costs are not envisaged to exceed USD 30 million. However, if such budget is exceeded, the shortfall shall be funded firstly by proceeds from the Tap Issue and the corresponding equity injection (including the Minimum Equity Amount) up to an aggregate amount of USD 5 million, and thereafter in cash through (i) new cash equity contribution and/or (ii) increased Subordinated Loan.

The rights of the Parent to receive fees under the Pre-Operational Management Agreements shall in an event of default be subordinated to the bondholders' rights for repayment of the Bonds pursuant to the Parent Undertaking (as defined below) provided that Parent will not be under any obligation to provide services if payment for such services is not made.

G&A Service Agreements:

The Issuer, Santa Maria Rigco and Covadonga Rigco and the Parent shall enter into an agreement with respect to the Parent's provision of commercial management, accounting, general and administrative services to the Issuer, Santa Maria and Covadonga Rigco (the "Issuer Group G&A Service Agreement"), as further described in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum.

The fees to be paid by the Issuer, Santa Maria Rigco and Covadonga Rigco and received by the Parent under the Issuer Group G&A Service Agreement (including any sub-contracting) shall always be subject to a maximum daily amount (payable monthly) of (i) USD 7,500 in the period from the Delivery Date until Rig #1 is accepted under its initial Drilling Contract (ii) USD 11,250 in the period from Rig #1 is accepted under its initial Drilling Contract until Rig #2 is accepted under its initial Drilling Contract and (iii) USD 15,000 thereafter.

The terms of the current G&A service agreement with respect to Rig #1 only (the "Rig #1 G&A Service Agreement") shall be terminated upon the Issuer Group G&A Service Agreement coming into force on the Delivery Date.

The rights of the Parent to receive fees under the Issuer Group G&A Service Agreement shall in an event of default be subordinated to the bondholders' rights for repayment of the Bonds pursuant to the Parent Undertaking (as defined below) provided that Parent will not be under any obligation to provide services if payment for such services is not made.

Simultaneously with the Operational Management Agreement coming into force, any applicable Bareboat Charter Contract shall be terminated.

The rights of the Parent to receive fees under any Operational Management Agreement shall in an event of default be subordinated to the bondholders' rights for repayment of the Bonds pursuant to the Parent Undertaking (as defined below) provided that Parent will not be under any obligation to provide services if payment for such services is not made.

( ii) the offshore jack-up Keppel FELS Mod V-B drilling rig identified as Hull No. B337t-338. to be named "Santa Maria" (the "Rig La Covadonga" ("Rig #2", and together with Rig #1, the "Rigs"), which is under construction at Keppel FELS in Singapore (the "Yard") pursuant to the Construction Contract. The--Rig #2 shall be registered in the Panamanian Ship Registry and delivered to Covadonga Rigco on the Delivery Date.
The date on which the title to the-Rig # 2 is transferred from the Yard to the IssuerCovadonga Rigco (the "Delivery Date") in accordance with the terms of the Construction Contract, with all relevant equipment properly owned and installed on such date. The Delivery Date is currently scheduled to be on 31 Jttjy30 November 2013.
The construction contract dated 29 April 2011 (as amended from time to time) made between the ParentCovadonga Rigco and the Yard for the construction of the-Rig #2 (the "Construction Contract") against payment of a total consideration of USD 192,000,000, with 20% of the contract price already having been paid and 80% of the contract price being payable on the

Drilling Contracts:

Delivery Date, and USD 1,000,000 being payable within 15 days of acceptance of4 he Rig S o under the initial Drilling Contract.

The R igRigs may during the term of the Bond be operating under one or more drilling contracts (each a "Drilling Contract") with clients in different jurisdictions (each a "Client").

The main strategy is however to secure a-- long term Drilling ContractContracts for the R igRigs with PEMEX Exploracion y Produccion ("Pemex") in Mexico in order to optimize the capabilities and competitive edge of the R igRigs and the Parent.

The Issuer shall only enter intoprocure that a Drilling Contract is only entered into if (i) the Client is an internationally reputable oil company and (ii) the Client's drilling operations or jurisdiction of incorporation is not any of Iran, North Korea, Venezuela or any other jurisdiction which is on any applicable United Nations, European Union or the United States of America's sanctions list.

The Parent has received a letter from Pemex dated 30 May 2013, confirming an intention to enter into a seven-year Drilling Contract for the Rig at a dayrate of approximately USD 158,000 (the "Pemex Letter").related to Rig #1. Pemex has after this date continued its internal approval processes for awarding a seven-year Drilling Contract for both Rigs at a day-rate of approximately USD 158.000. and the Parent expect a final Pemex approval of such Drilling Contracts on 13 October 2013.

It is th e -anticipated that a Drilling ContractContracts with Pemex will be entered into by the Parent as the contractual party towards Pemex, based on the offeroffers made by the Parent to Pemex and the Pemex Lettercommunications with and approvals by Pemex as described above. The Parent will secure the availability of the R igRigs from the IssuerRigcos through the Bareboat Charter ContractContracts (as defined below).

However, after the initial Drilling

with Pemex tsare

secured, the Parent undertakes to request and use its reasonable best

endeavours to obtain consent from Pemex to novate the said Drilling

ContractContracts from the Parent to the Issuer orrespective Rigcos (or a

wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary of the Issuersubsidiaries thereof), and the

Parent shall with respect to future Drilling Contracts (whether with Pemex or

not), use its reasonable best endeavours to permit that such Drilling

Contracts are entered into directly by the R suerrespective Rigcos (or itstheir

wholly owned subsidiarvsubsidiaries in the relevant jurisdiction) (referred to

as the "Direct IssuerRigco Contract Regime"). If required by the Client under

the Direct IssuerRigco Contract Regime, the Parent shall provide the Client

with a performance guarantee in such form and substance as reasonably

requested by the Client. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing prior to

any implementation of the Direct IssuerRigco Contract Regime for any of the

Rigs, including details of the terms of the new Drilling Contract and the

Operational Management Agreement (as defined below).
