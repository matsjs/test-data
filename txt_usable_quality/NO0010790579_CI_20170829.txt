Tenant adaption of both these premises were made in the second quarter, and both tenants moved in in August 2017. Total tenant adaption costs fo r the tw o contracts amounted to approximately NOK 4,000 per sqm, and the yearly rent contribution is approximately NOK 3.0 m illion. In addition, the Company's share of yearly common costs w ill be reduced by approxim ately NOK 0.5 m illion. As at 30 June 2017, the weighted average contract length is 5.6 years. The vacancy rate in the park is 27% in to ta l, w ith the highest vacancy rates in Ole Deviks vei 2 and 4. On 27 A pril 2017, the Company com pleted a Senior Secured Bond Issue, ISIN: NO 0010790579.

Financial highlights
Both rental income and to ta l operating expenses fo r the firs t half o f 2017 were generally in line w ith the same period in 2016. The e ffe ct from newly signed contracts w ill firs t become evident in the second half o f 2017. A fte r adjusting for the unrealised value change in investment property o f NOK 2.1 m illion, the Group had an operating p ro fit of NOK 13.5 m illion and a net p ro fit of 3.2 m illion in the in terim period from 1 January to 30 June 2017.
The consolidated balance sheet is largely affected by the refinancing described above. Total non-current lia bilities have been reduced from NOK 395.8 m illion at 31 December 2016 to NOK 345.2 m illion at 30 June 2017. Total non-current liabilities are presented net of fees (outstanding bond amount is NOK 350 m illion), in compliance w ith IFRS. In addition, the Company now has a significant cash " b u ffe r" of NOK 20.2 m illion.
In terms o f cash flow, the positive contribution from operations of 5.3 m illion is largely offset by the significant investments made in the properties in the same period. The cash increase from 4.1 m illion at 31 December 2016 to NOK 20.2 m illion at 2017 is therefore mainly a ttribu tab le to financing activities.
Accounting principles
The consolidated financial statements have been drawn up in accordance w ith International Standards fo r Financial Reporting (IFRS). The consolidated accounts for the quarter have been compiled in accordance w ith IAS 34 - Interim Financial Reporting.
Tveten Park has not previously reported a consolidated financial statem ent according to IFRS. Because of this, the adoption of IFRS has not led to changes in previously reported figures. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis o f the historical cost principle, w ith the exception of investment properties, which are measured at fa ir value.
The Group has in 2017 changed its principle regarding presentation o f common costs. Common costs were u n til 31 December 2016 capitalised alongside payments on account from tenants and therefore had no im pact on the income statem ent. Common costs from 1 January 2017 are presented gross in the income statem ent. As per 30 June 2017, common costs are approxim ately NOK 3.8m (included in both " Other income" and " Other operational expenses" ).

Subsidiaries are all entities over w hich the Group exercises control of financial and operating policies, normally through ow nership of more than half the capital w ith voting rights. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on w hich control is transferred to the Group, and are deconsolidated w hen control ceases.

TVETEN PARK AS
Segm ent information
The Group owns investment property in Ole Deviks vei in Oslo which is considered to be one reporting segment.
Borrowing costs
Borrow ing costs are recognises in the financial statement w hen they occur. Borrow ing costs for capital used to finance buildings under construction are capitalised under the asset in question. When calculating the capitalised borrow ing costs, the average interest rate on the company's debt portfolio over the course of the year is used, unless there is separate financing for the specific project. In such cases the specific borrow ing cost for the loan in question is used. When calculating the average interest rate to be used for the capitalisation of borrow ing costs, loans taken out for specific projects are not included.
Investment property
Investment property is ow ned w ith the aim of achieving a long-term return from rental income and increase in value. Investment property is recognised at fair value, based on marked values identified by an independent values. Gains and losses as a result of changes in the marked value of investment properties are recognised in profit or loss as they arise, and are presented on a separate line after total operating expenses. Initial measurement also takes into consideration the property's cost price, w hich includes direct transaction costs such as document duty, and other public duties, legal fees and due diligence costs. Transaction costs associated w ith properties acquires through business combinations (as defined in IFRS 3) are expensed. Subsequent expenditure is added to the investment property's carrying amount, if it is probable that future financial benefits associated w ith the expenditure w ill flow to the Group and the expense can be measured reliably. Other maintenance costs are recorded through the income statement in the period in w hich they are incurred. When investment properties are disposed of, the difference between the net sales proceeds and carrying amount is recognised as change in value from investment properties. Investment properties are valued at 30.06 and at 31.12. The values are estimated by independent valuers. The valuation is based on the individual property's assumed future cash flow s, and property values are arrived at by discounting cash flow s w ith an individual risk-adjusted required rate of return. The required rate of return fo r each property is defined as being a long-term risk-free interest rate plus a propertyspecific risk supplement. The latter is defined on the basis of the property segment to w hich the property belongs, its location, standard, occupancy rate, tenants' financial reliability and remaining lease term. Know n market transactions w ith similar properties in the same geographical area are also taken into consideration. Changes in fair value are recognised as "changes in value from investment property"
Trade receivables and other financial assets
Trade receivables and other financial assets are classified as loans and receivables and are measured at fair value upon initial recognition, and thereafter at amortised cost. Interest is ignored if it is insignificant A provision fo r bad debts is recognised if there is objective evidence that the Group w ill not receive payment in accordance w ith the original conditions. Any subsequent payments received against accounts fo r w hich a provision has previously been made are recognised in the income statement. Trade receivables and other financial assets are classified as current assets, unless they are due more than twelve months after the balance sheet date. If so, they are classified as non-current assets.
10

TVETEN PARKAS
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments w ith an original term to maturity of no more than three months.
Trade payables and other non-interest-bearing financial liabilities
Trade payables and other non-interest-bearing liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost, and are measured at fair value upon initial recognition, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Interest is ignored if it is insignificant.
Interest-bearing liabilities
Interest-bearing liabilities w ith variable interest rates are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost, and are measured at fair value upon initial recognition, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method
Interest-bearing liabilities are classified as current liabilities w here the debt is due for repayment less than 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Tax
The tax expense consists of tax payable and deferred tax. Tax is charged to the income statement, except w here it relates to items that are recognised directly in equity. In such cases, the tax is either recognised in comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Deferred tax is calculated using the liability method for all temporary differences betw een the tax values and consolidated accounting values of assets and liabilities. Any deferred tax arising from the initial reporting of a liability or asset in a transaction w hich is not a business combination and w hich on the transaction date does not affect accounting or tax results is not recognised on the balance sheet. Deferred tax is defined using tax rates and law s w hich are enacted or likely to be enacted on the balance sheet date, and w hich are expected to be used w hen the deferred tax asset is realised or w hen the deferred tax is utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated and provided or reduced in the event of adjustments to the value of investment properties at a nominal tax rate of 24 per cent from 31 December 2016. For investment properties acquired through the purchase of shares in property companies or not acquired through a business combination, in the event of an adjustment in value, deferred tax is calculated on the property's fiscal value.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is likely that future taxable profit w ill be available against w hich the temporary differences can be offset.
Provisions
The Group recognises provisions for lease agreements and legal claims w hen a legal or self-imposed obligation exists as a result of past events, it is likely on a balance of probabilities that an outflow of resources w ill be required to settle the obligation and its amount can be estimated w ith a sufficient degree of reliability. There is no provision for future bad debts.
Revenue Recognition
Operating revenue consists of rental income and other operating revenue. Gains on the sale of property are presented as part of the change in value. Rental income encompasses the fair value of the payments received for services that fall within the ordinary activities of the company. Rental income is presented net of VAT, rebates and discounts. Common costs were until 31 December 2016 capitalised alongside payments on account from tenants and therefore had no impact on the income statement. Common costs from 1 January 2016 are presented gross in the income statement. Common costs are settled after the balance sheet date.
Rental income is recognised over the duration of the lease. If a rent exemption is agreed, or if the tenant receives an incentive in conjunction w ith the signing of the lease, the cost or loss of rent is spread over the duration of the lease, and the resulting net rent is recognised in equal instalments. The accrued loss of rent or costs is presented under other receivables.

Statement of cash flows
The statement of cash flow s is prepared using the indirect method. This means that the statement is based on the Group's profit before tax in order to present cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities respectively.
3 Critical accounting estimates and subjective judgments
Fair value of investment properties Investment properties are measured at their fair value based on external, independent valuations.
Biannually, all the properties are valued by one independent, external valuer. The valuation at 30 June 2017 w as obtained from Mailing & Co Forvaltning AS. The valuation is mainly based on the discounted cash flow method, w hich involves discounting future cash flows over a specified period using an estimated discount rate and then adding a residual value at the end of the period. Future cash flow s are calculated on the basis of cash flows from signed leases, as well as future cash flows based on an expected market rent at the end of the lease terms. The fair value of investment properties is therefore mainly affected by expected market rents, discount rates and inflation. The market rent for each property takes into account the property's situation, standard and leases signed for comparable properties in the area. For the duration of existing lease terms, the discount rate is mainly based on an assessment of the individual tenants' financial solidity and classification. After the end of the lease term, cash flow s are discounted using a discount rate that takes into account the risk relating to letting and location Inflation is estimated using the consensus of a selection of banks and official statistics.
When carrying out the valuation, the valuer receives comprehensive details of the leases for the properties, floor space and details of any vacant premises, and up-to-date information about all ongoing projects. Any uncertainties relating to the properties/projects and leases are also clarified verbally and in w rlting as and when required. The Group performs internal controls to ensure that all relevant information is included in the valuations.
The valuer performs its valuation on the basis of the information it has received, and estimate future market rents, yields, inflation and other relevant parameters. Each individual property is assessed in terms of its market position, rental income (contractual rents versus market rents) and ow nership costs, w ith estimates being made for anticipated vacancy levels and the need for alterations and upgrades. The remaining term of the leases is also assessed for risk, along w ith any special clauses in the contracts. Each property is also compared with recently sold properties in the same segment (location, type of property, mix of tenants, etc.)

4 Segment information
The Group consists of investment properties in Ole Deviksvei 2-6 in Oslo and is considered to be one reporting segment.
