The Issuer and the Bareboat Charterer shall use their reasonable best endeavours to ensure that any new Drilling Contract allows for an Assignment of Earnings and/or obtain any required consent from the relevant Client. Subject to the foregoing, any new Assignment of Earnings shall be established and effective within sixty (60) calendar days after entry into of a Drilling Contract, and always prior to commencement of such Drilling Contract.
^ permitted under such new Drilling Contract and its governing law, and provided such contract is for a duration of more than twelve (12) months, the Bareboat Charterer shall further provide an assignment by way of security of all other rights (other than the earnings) of the Bareboat Charterer, including step-in rights, under the new Drilling Contract, and if not permitted without consent from the Client, the Issuer and the Bareboat Charterer shall use their reasonable best endeavours, to obtain the Client's consent to such assignment with corresponding step in rights.

Upon request from the Issuer, the Bond Trustee may (but shall not be obligated to) waive the requirement in this Clause 8.3 on shorter Drilling Contracts or otherwise where e.g. the scope, perfection, cost, work and time of providing the security is, in the reasonable opinion of the Bond Trustee, disproportionate to the benefits accruing to the Bondholders.
The Issuer shall provide legal opinions addressed to the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders), which shall include, inter alia, confirmations on capacity, validity, perfection and enforceability of such Additional Security (in a form and content satisfactory to the Bond Trustee).

(b) undertake with the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) that, whenever the Issuer does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document, the Guarantors shall, on the Bond Trustee's first written demand (in Norwegian: "vedførste påkrav") and in no event any later than 14 Business Days after the relevant Guarantor's receipt of such demand, and without any proof of default or loss and regardless of objection by the Issuer or any other Obligor of any kind, pay that amount to the Bond Trustee or as it directs as if it was the principal obligor in respect of that amount together with interest at the Default Rate on the amount payable by the Guarantor from the date of demand until the date of payment, both before and after judgment; and

(c)

agree with the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) that if, for any reason,

any amount claimed by the Bond Trustee under this Clause is not recoverable from

the Guarantors, then the Guarantors will be liable as a principal debtor and primary

obligor to indemnify the Bond Trustee and each Bondholder for any loss each of

them may incur as a result of the Issuer failing to pay any amount expressed to be

payable by it under a Finance Document on the date when it ought to have been

paid.

8.4.2 For the avoidance of doubt, each Guarantor hereby waives:

(a)

any requirement that the Bond Trustee or any of the Bondholders in case of an Event

of Default first have to make demand upon or seek to enforce remedies against the

Issuer or any other person;

#7013367/3

19/45
(b) any and all defences or objections from any party in or based on underlying relationships, agreements and transactions whatsoever, including, without limitation, any such relationships, agreements or transactions with any third party for Security Interests or otherwise, and right to limit the liability under the guarantee provided hereunder resulting from any failure to give notice of any kind;

the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in full or in part of any Finance

Document, or

(ii) any amendment of any Finance Document or supplement thereto or any other act, omission or circumstance which would affect the obligations of any party under any Finance Document, or

(iii) the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganisation or change of ownership of the Issuer or any other Obligor; and

(b) that the Guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of all sums payable by the Issuer or any other Obligor under the Finance Documents, regardless of (i) any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part or (ii) the Bond Trustee enforcing any other Security granted for the Issuer's obligations under this Bond Agreement and the Finance Documents.

8.5 Quiet Enjoyment Letter
The Bond Trustee shall issue a quiet enjoyment letter (the "Quiet Enjoyment Letter") if so required by any Client, with wording as reasonably requested by such Client, however so that the quiet enjoyment letter may only be issued if the letter provides the Bond Trustee to assign the Drilling Contract to nominee of the Bond Trustee being reasonably satisfactory to the Client. 9

Except as otherwise expressly provided, all amounts payable under this Bond Agreement and any other Finance Document shall be payable in the same currency as the Bonds are denominated in. If, however, the Bondholder has not given instruction as set out in Clause 11.3.1 within five (5) Business Days prior to a Payment Date, the cash settlement will be exchanged into NOK and credited to the NOK bank account registered with the Bondholder's account in the Securities Depository.
Amounts payable in respect of costs, expenses, taxes and other liabilities of a similar nature shall be payable in the currency in which they are incurred.

The interest charged under this Clause 11.5 shall be added to the defaulted amount on each respective Interest Payment Date relating thereto until the defaulted amount has been repaid in full.
The unpaid amounts shall bear interest as stated above until payment is made, whether or not the Bonds are declared to be in default pursuant to Clause 15.1, cf. Clause 15.10.
Partial payments Subject to the Inter-Creditor Agreement, if the Bond Trustee or the Paying Agent receives a payment that is insufficient to discharge all the amounts then due and payable under the Finance Documents, that payment shall be applied in the following order:

Trustee under the Finance Documents;

(b) secondly, in or towards payment of any accrued interest due but unpaid under the Bond Agreement, pro rata and without any preference or priority of any kind; and
