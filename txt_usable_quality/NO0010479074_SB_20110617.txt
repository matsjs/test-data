Proposal to amend Bond Loan Agreements - Change of Borrower - Summons to New and Repeated Bondholders' Meetings
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM" / "Norsk Tillitsmann") acts as trustee for the holders of bonds (the "Bonds") in the above-captioned loans (the "Loans") where Norse Energy Holding Inc. ("NEHI") is the Borrower. Bondholders in NEC05 receive this summons only as information as NEC05 is not summoned for a meeting by this summons. All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreements dated 30 June 2010 (the "Loan Agreements") or the summons to this Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise stated. The information in this summons regarding the Company and its legal position is provided by the Company. Norsk Tillitsmann expressly disclaims all and any liability whatsoever related to such information. 1. BACKGROUND NEHI/NEC have approached NTM to summon a Bondholders' Meeting with respect to the Loans in order to propose to the Bondholders a change in the Loan Agreements where by Norse Energy Corp ASA ("NEC" or the "Company") is reinstated as the Borrower. NEHI is a 100% owned subsidiary of NEC. The purpose of the proposal is to ensure that bondholders are not subject to U.S. withholding tax on interest payments. See attached letter from NEHI for background.
PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo ] Haakon VIIs gate i, Oslo Switchboard: +47 22 87 94 00 | Fax: +47 22 87 9410 | www.trustee.no

Accordingly NEC/NEHI proposes that the Loan Agreements are changed where by NEC is reinstated as Borrower while NEHI remain co-responsible for payment as a Guarantor. With this solution the Bondholders will retain 100% of the agreed interest without being exposed to U.S withholding tax.
NEHI/NEC proposes that the covenants in the Loan Agreements clause 16.2 is extended to also cover the Guarantor while the equity requirements in the Loan Agreements clauses 16.4 remain on NEHI level. Accordingly the covenant structure will remain upon the switch of roles among NEHI and NEC. Upon implementation thereof an intercompany loan with NEHI as debtor and NEC as creditor for the total amount will be reinstated and such loan included in the security for the bond loans.
On 13 M ay 2011 NTM issued a Summons for a Bondholder's Meeting to be held on 25 May 2011. In this meeting no quorum was established with respect to NEC02 and NEC04 while the amendment proposal was rejected with respect to NEC03 where a quorum was established. A quorum was established for NEC05 where all bondholders voted in favor o f the amendment proposal but subject to corresponding amendments to the loan agreements for the other bond loans. Accordingly all loan agreements remain unchanged following the Bondholder's Meetings on 25 May 2011.
NEHI and NEC have approached NTM and asked for new Bondholder's Meetings to be summoned at June 27, and that such meetings shall be organized as Repeated Bondholder' Meeting under Clause 21 of the loan agreements in respect of NEC02 and NEC04, in which no quorum rules will apply. For NEC03 the meeting will be organized as a new meeting. NEC05 has already approved the proposal there will be no meeting for NEC05.
Please note that there are made some specifications and adjustments to the Amendment Agreements in Annex 1 compared to what was presented to the Bondholders in connection with the Bondholders' meeting held 25 May 2011.
2. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES
2.1. The Company's evaluation
The Company is o f the opinion that the proposal is strongly beneficial to the Company and all stakeholders including the Bondholders, who will retain full interest payment without deduction of withholding tax at source with no change in the debtor/guarantor obligations and/or value of the Bonds.
NEHI has informed NTN that they will then have to deduct a 30% withholding tax at source as required by U.S. law and will perform full payment of interest only to those bondholders who document to NEH I's satisfaction that they qualify for exemption from withholding tax under U.S. law.
2.2. N T M 's evaluation
As a matter of policy, NTM puts the requests forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendation, and amplifies that each Bondholder cast its vote on the Bondholders' meeting based on its own judgement. N TM urges each Bondholder to seek counsel in order to evaluate the Proposal.

3. SUMMONS FOR BONDHOLDERS' MEETINGS
A joint bondholders' meeting will be held for all bond issues (except NEC05 which will not have a new meeting). Voting procedures will be carried out separately for each individual bond issue.
Based on the above information, Bondholders are hereby summoned to a bondholders' meeting:

For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to Norsk Tillitsmann, to notify Norsk Tillitsmann by telephone or by email (as set out at the first page o f this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo tune) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.

Oslo, June 17, 2011
Reference is made to Norsk Tillitsmann ASA's ("NTM") summons for new and repeated Bondholder Meetings on 27 June 2011 in the above bond loans (the "Loans") where Norse Energy Holdings Inc ("NEHI") is the borrower and Norse Energy Corp ASA ("NEC") is guarantor.
NEHI and NEC have approached NTM to summon a Bondholders' Meeting with respect to the Loans in order to propose to the Bondholders a change in the Loan Agreements where by NEC is reinstated as the Borrower while NEHI becomes Guarantor. NEHI is a 100% owned subsidiary of NEC.
In the initial bond loan agreements from 2006 and 2008, NEC was the Borrower. In the bond debt restructuring in 2010, NEHI assumed the role of the Borrower while NEC assumed the role of Guarantor.
Since then the Company has become aware that NEHI as an U.S. incorporated entity is required to deduct 30% withholding tax at source in interest payments to non-U.S bondholders. An exemption is available for bondholders domiciled in states having a tax treaty with the U.S. (including Norway and Sweden) who provides NEHI with the completed W8-BEN form with information on their relevant bond holdings ("Eligible Bondholders", cf. below).
The Loan Agreements is supplemented by Norwegian law. Norwegian law entitles NEHI to deduct the U.S. withholding tax at source as prescribed by U.S. law.
No deductions at source have so far been made in respect of the interest payments from NEHI including the interest payment of April 2011.
NORSE EN ERG Y HOLDINGS INC · 200 Northpointe Circle, Ste 200 · Seven Fields, PA 16046 · Tel 724 772-8260 · Fax 724 772-8269

NEHI has an obligation to pay withholding tax to the U.S. tax authorities irrespective of not having deducted at source. NEHI has so far carried the tax burden for the Bondholders by not deducting at source. This triggers a tax obligation upon NEHI and is clearly not a viable solution to NEC/NEHI in the long term.
Accordingly NEHI proposes that the Loan Agreements are changed where by NEC is reinstated as Borrower while NEHI remain co-responsible for payment as a Guarantor. With this solution the Bondholders will retain 100% of the agreed interest without being exposed to U.S withholding tax.
NEHI proposes that the covenants in the Loan Agreements clause 16.2 is extended to also cover the Guarantor while the equity requirements in the Loan Agreements clauses 16.4 remain on NEHI level. Accordingly the covenant structure will remain upon the switch of roles among NEHI and NEC. Upon implementation thereof an intercompany loan with NEHI as debtor and NEC as creditor for the total amount will be reinstated and such loan included in the security for the bond loans.
NEHI advices that if the new and repeated Bondholder's Meeting should not approve the proposed amendments NEHI will start deducting a 30 % U.S. withholding tax at source in the future interest payment from and including the payments scheduled in July 2011. Only 70% of the agreed interest amounts would then be distributed to all Bondholders through the VPS/Nordea payment system. Eligible Bondholders would be entitled to receive the remaining 30% upon providing NEHI with W-8 BEN or W-9 forms with information on their holding as of each interest payment date.
However in order to save NEHI and the Eligible Bondholders for such administrative burdens and to cater for payment of 100% of interest also to non-Eligible Bondholders, NEHI proposes that the Loan Agreements are amended as proposed herein.
As for the interest payments already made by NEHI, Eligible Bondholder (including but not limited to bondholders domiciled in Norway, Sweden and the U.S) should as soon as possible forward the relevant W8-BEN or W-9 form to NEHI with a specification of the total amount of interest received by the bondholder. Compliance therewith will reduce the U.S. tax obligation on NEHI, and its cash reserves be better spent on improving value to all its stakeholders including the holders of warrants, shares and bonds.
