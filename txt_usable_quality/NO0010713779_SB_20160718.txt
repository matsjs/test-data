12.00 per cent. Xcite Energy Resources Limited Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2014/2016

Notice of a Written Bondholders' Resolution

Oslo, 18 July 2016

1.

NOTICE OF A WRITTEN BONDHOLDERS' RESOLUTION

Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders o f the bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue" or the "Bonds") in respect of which Xcite Energy Resources pic (formerly Xcite Energy Resources Limited) (the "Issuer")) is the issuer and Xcite Energy Limited (the "Parent") is the guarantor.

All capitalised terms used in this summons (the "Summons") shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 27 June 2014 (as amended and/or restated from time to time, including on 30 June 2016 by amendment agreement no. 1) and made between the Issuer, the Parent and the Bond Trustee (the "Bond Agreement") unless otherwise stated herein.

The Issuer has requested that the Bond Trustee issue this request for a written Bondholders' resolution pursuant to Clause 16.5 ( Written Resolution) o f the Bond Agreement to consider approval o f the Proposed Resolution (as defined below).

2.

BACKGROUND

The shares in the Parent (the "Parent Shares") were historically admitted to trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the "TSX"). As a result, the Parent's articles o f association (the "Articles of Association") include a number of provisions relevant to the TSX and adopted pursuant to advice from the Parent's historical Canadian advisors. As the Parent Shares no longer trade on the TSX, the Parent is proposing to amend its Articles o f Association to remove these provisions. In addition, the Parent is proposing to update its Articles of Association in order to bring them into line with the current laws o f the British Virgin Islands, where the Parent is incorporated.

In light o f the above, the Issuer is proposing the following amendments to the Articles of Association (and in this paragraph, all references to an "Article" are to the relevant article in the Articles of Association):

(a) Article 3.12 shall be deleted in its entirety and the following shall be inserted as a new Article 3.12:

"3.12 A bonus share issued by the Company shall be deemed to ha\>e been fu lly p a id fo r on issue

(b) the following shall be inserted into Article 7.1 immediately after the words "requirements of the Act":

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

nordictrustee.com

"or without the need fo r a written instrument o f transfer if the transfer is carried out in accordance with the requirements:

(a) applicable to shares listed on AIM; (b) o f the London Stock Exchange; and (c) o f these Articles. ";

(c) the word "provided" in Article 20.1 shall be deleted and replaced with the words "in relation to any Directors' meeting and any written resolution circulated for written consent, save that he may not himself appoint an alternate Director or proxy and in the case of any Directors' meeting,";

(d) the words "and underlying documentation" shall be inserted into Article 34.1 immediately after the word "records"; and

(e) a new Article 34.2 shall be inserted as follows and the numbering of that Article shall be amended accordingly:
"The records required to be kept by the Company under the Act, the Mutual Legal Assistance (Tax Matters Act), 2003, the Memorandum or these Articles shall be kept in written form or either wholly or partly as electronic records complying with the requirements o f the Electronic Transactions Act (British Virgin Islands). The records and underlying documentation shall be keptfo r a period o f at leastfive years from the date o f completion o f the relevant transaction or the company terminates the business relationship to which the records and underlying documentation relate. ",

(together, the "Articles Amendments").

A copy of the Articles o f Association which shows the proposed Articles Amendments is appended at Schedule 1.

On 4 July 2016, the Parent gave its shareholders notice o f the Parent's 2016 Annual General Meeting, which will be held on 27 July 2016 ("AGM "), at which shareholders will be asked to, amongst others, approve the Articles Amendments (as defined below).

Pursuant to Clause 15.1.11 o f the Bond Agreement, the amendment of the constitutional documents of the Parent constitutes an Event of Default (which entitles the Bond Trustee to immediately declare the Outstanding Bonds (including accrued interest, costs and expenses) to be in default and due for immediate payment), unless the amendments are approved by a Bondholders' Meeting or by Written Resolution. The Parent is therefore requesting that the Bondholders approve the Articles Amendments by way o f Written Resolution so that, if the requisite majority of the Parent's shareholders vote in favour of the Articles Amendments at the AGM and as a result the Articles o f Association are amended to reflect the Articles Amendments, an Event of Default shall not occur under the Bond Agreement.

3.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

In light of the above, the Issuer proposes the following (the "Proposed Resolution"):

"Bondholders authorise and instruct the Bond Trustee to approve the Articles Amendments so that no Event o f Default will occur under the Bond Agreement if the Articles Amendments become effective as a result o f shareholder approvals provided at the AGM, such authorisation and instruction to take effect as a Written Resolution."

-2-

4.

NON-RELIANCE

The Proposed Resolution is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee and nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate the Proposed Resolution and decide whether or not to approve it accordingly.

None o f the Bond Trustee or its advisers accept any responsibility to Bondholders in relation to the impact o f the Articles Amendments or the Proposed Resolution on Bondholders' tax or accounting affairs. Each Bondholder should consult their own independent legal advisers in relation to any tax and/or accounting implications of the Articles Amendments and the Proposed Resolution.

5.

WRITTEN BONDHOLDERS' RESOLUTION

Bondholders are hereby provided with a voting request for a Written Resolution pursuant to Clause 16.5 of the Bond Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no Bondholders' Meeting will be held.

For a vote to be valid, the Bond Trustee must have received it by post, courier or email to the address indicated in the enclosed form at Schedule 2 (the "Voting Form") no later than 25 July 2016 at 13.00 hours (Oslo time) (the "Voting Deadline").

Notwithstanding the Voting Deadline, and subject to the provisions o f Clause 16.5 o f the Bond Agreement, the Proposed Resolution will become effective automatically upon receipt of affirmative votes by or on behalf of the Bondholders who at the date of this notice represent such majority of votes as would be required if the Proposed Resolution was voted on at a Bondholders' Meeting (which, for the avoidance o f doubt, is 60% o f the Voting Bonds pursuant to Clause 16.3.5 of the Bond Agreement) at which all Bondholders entitled to attend and vote thereat were present and voting.

Votes which are submitted are final and cannot be withdrawn. In the event that Bonds are transferred to a new owner after votes have been submitted in respect o f such Bonds, the new Bondholders shall accordingly not be entitled to submit a vote.

Yours sincerely

5.2 The register of Shareholder may be in such form as the Directors may approve, but if it is in magnetic, electronic or other data storage form, the Company must be able to produce legible evidence of its contents. Unless the directornDirectors otherwise determine, the magnetic, electronic or other data storage form shall be the original register of Shareholder.

(a) determining the Shareholders entitled to receive any Distribution, allotment or issue and such Record Date may be on, or at any time not more than thirty days before or after, any date on which such Distribution, allotment or issue is declared, paid or made; and

(b) determining the Shareholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at any general meeting of the Company;

provided that in respect of paragraph (a) above, the Directors may fix the date on which notice is given of a general meeting, or such other date as may be specified in the notice, as the Record Date for determining those Shareholders that are entitled to vote at the general meeting.

if the transfer is carried out in accordance with the requirements^

£aj

applicable to shares listed on AIMili

(h)

of the London Stock F.xchange: and f

of these Articles, ^

The instrument of transfer shall be sent to the Comnanv for registration.

7.2 The instrument of transfer of any share shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor and contain the name and address of the transferee. The Board may also resolve, either generally or in any particular case, upon request by either the transferor or transferee, to

Legal -11273664.2^

^3
110126 vT^j

-10-

accept mechanically executed transfers. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the Register in respect thereof. The Company shall not be required to treat a transferee of a share as a Shareholder until the transferee's name has been entered in the Register. Nothing in these Articles shall preclude the Board from recognising a renunciation of the allotment or provisional allotment of any share by the allottee in favour of some other person.

7.3 The Board shall require that an instrument of transfer be signed by a transferee if registration as a holder of the share imposes a liability to the Company on the transferee.

7.4 The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving any reason therefor, pass a resolution refusing, preventing or delaying to register a transfer of any share, in respect of:

(a) any share issued under any share incentive scheme for employees upon which a restriction on transfer imposed thereby still subsists; or

(b) a transfer of any share to more than three joint holders.

7.5 No transfer shall be made to an infant or to a person of unsound mind or under other legal disability.

7.6 Save as provided in these Articles, there shall be no restriction on the transfer of fully paid up shares (except where required by law).

7.7 Without limiting the generality of the last preceding Article, the Board may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer unless:

(a) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share; and

(b) the instrument of transfer is lodged at the Office or the office o f the Company's transfer agent accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer (and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that person so to do).

7.8 If the Board resolves to refuse or delay the registration of a transfer of any share, it shall, as soon as practicable send to each of the transferor and transferee notice of the refusal or delay.

7.9 The registration of transfers of shares or of any class of shares may be suspended at such times and for such periods as the Board may determine.

TRANSMISSION OF REGISTERED SHARES

8.1 In the case of the death of a Shareholder, the survivor or survivors where the deceased Shareholder was a joint holder, and the legal personal representatives of the deceased Shareholder where the deceased Shareholder was a sole holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to the deceased Shareholder's interest in the shares. Nothing herein shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect of any Share which had been jointly held by such deceased Shareholder with other persons. Subject to the provisions of the laws of the British Virgin Islands, for the purpose of this Article, legal personal representative means the executor or administrator of a deceased Shareholder or such other person as the Board may, in its absolute discretion,

Leeal -11273664.211

110126 y7^j

-mJl

decide as being properly authorised to deal with the shares of a deceased Shareholder. Where two or more persons are registered as joint holders of a share or shares, then in the event of the death of any joint holder or holders the remaining joint holder or holders shall be absolutely entitled to the said share or shares and the Company shall recognise no claim in respect of the estate of any joint holder except in the case of the last survivor of such joint holders.

8.2 Any person becoming entitled by operation of law to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy or winding-up of a Shareholder may, upon such evidence as to his title being produced as may be required by the Board, elect either to become the holder of the share or to have some person nominated by him registered as the transferee thereof. If he elects to become the holder he shall notify the Company in writing to that effect. If he elects to have another person registered he shall execute a transfer of the share in favour of that person. The provisions of these Articles relating to the transfer and registration of transfers of shares shall apply to such notice or transfer as aforesaid as if the death or bankruptcy of the Shareholder had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed by such Shareholder.

8.3 A person becoming entitled by operation of law to a Share by reason of the death or bankruptcy or winding-up of a Shareholder shall be entitled to the same Distributions and other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the registered holder of the Share. However, the Board may, if it thinks fit, withhold the payment of any Distribution payable or other advantages in respect of such share until such person shall become the registered holder of the share or shall have effectually transferred such share, but, subject to the requirements of Article 12.11 being met, such a person may vote at meetings.

GENERAL MEETINGS

9.1 An annual general meeting of the Company shall be held in each year other than the year of the Company's incorporation at such time (within a period of not more than eighteen months after the date of incorporation or not more than fifteen months after the holding of the last preceding annual general meeting) and place as may be determined by the Board. At least twenty-one clear days' Notice o f such meeting shall be given to each Shareholder.

9.2 Each general meeting, other than an annual general meeting, shall be called an extraordinary general meeting. General meetings may be held in any part of the world as may be determined by the Board.

9.3 The Board may, whenever it thinks fit, call extraordinary general meetings, and the Board shall call an extraordinary general meeting if requested in writing to do so by Shareholder (the "Petitioner") entitled to exercise, at the date of deposit of the request not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of the matter for which the meeting is being requested. The written request shall be made to the Board or the Secretary of the Company, to require an extraordinary general meeting to be called by the Board for the transaction of any business specified in such requisition; and such meeting shall be held within two months after the deposit of such request. If within twenty-one days of such deposit the Board fails to proceed to convene such meeting the petitioners themselves may do so in the same manner, and all reasonable expenses incurred by the petitioners as a result of the failure of the Board shall be reimbursed to the petitioners by the Company.

10 NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS
10.1 At least fourteen clear days' Notice of a general meeting (other than an annual general meeting) shall be given to those persons whose name, on the date of the Notice is given, appear in the Register and are entitled to vote at the general meeting. A general meeting at which the passing of a special resolution is to be considered shall be called by not less than twenty-one clear days' Notice. The Notice of meeting must state the date, time and place of the meeting and the general nature of the business to be considered at the meeting. A general meeting, whether or not a special resolution will be considered at such meeting, may be called by shorter Notice if it is so agreed:
(a) in the case of a meeting called as an annual general meeting, by all the Shareholders entitled to attend and vote thereat; and
(b) in the case of any other meeting, by a majority in number o f the Shareholders having the right to attend and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety per cent, of the total voting rights on all the matters to be considered at the meeting;
and for this purpose, the presence of a Shareholder at the general meeting shall be deemed to constitute waiver on his part.
10.2 The Notice shall specify the day, time and place of the meeting and, in case of special business, the general nature of the business. Any Notice of a general meeting to consider special business shall be accompanied by a statement regarding the effect of any proposed resolution on the Company in respect of such special business. The Notice convening an annual general meeting shall specify the meeting as such. Notice of every general meeting shall be given to all Shareholders, other than to such Shareholders as, under the provisions of these Articles or the terms of issue of the shares they hold, are not entitled to receive such Notices from the Company, and to each of the Directors and the Auditors.
10.3 The Secretary may postpone any general meeting called in accordance with the provisions of these Articles (other than a meeting requisitioned under these Articles) provided that Notice of postponement is given to each Shareholder before the time for such meeting. Fresh Notice of the date, time and place for the postponed meeting shall be given to each Shareholder in accordance with the provisions o f these Articles.
10.4 The inadvertent failure to give Notice of a meeting or (in cases where instruments of proxy are sent out with the Notice) to send such instrument of proxy to, or the fact that a Shareholder has not received such Notice or such instrument of proxy by, any person entitled to receive such Notice shall not invalidate any resolution passed or the proceedings at that meeting.
11 PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS
11.1 Shareholders may participate in any general meeting by means of such telephone or other electronic means as permit all persons participating in the meeting to hear and communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

11.2 All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general meeting, and also all business that is transacted at an annual general meeting, with the exception of sanctioning dividends, the reading, considering and adopting of the accounts and balance sheet and the reports of the Directors and Auditors and other documents required to be annexed to the balance sheet, the election of Directors and appointment of Auditors and other officers in the place of those retiring, the fixing of the remuneration of the Auditors, and the voting of remuneration or extra remuneration to the Directors.
11.3 No business, other than the appointment of a chairman of a meeting, shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Shareholders is present at the time when the meeting proceeds to business. Except as herein otherwise provided, two Shareholders present in person (or in the case of a Shareholder being a corporation by its duly authorised representative) or by proxy shall form a quorum, provided that if the Company shall at any time have only one Shareholder, one Shareholder present in person (or being a corporation by its duly authorised representative) or by proxy shall form a quorum, for the transaction of business at any general meeting of the Company held during such time.
11.4 If within thirty minutes (or such longer time not exceeding one hour as the chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened at the request of Shareholders, shall be dissolved. In any other case it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week at the same time and place or to such time and place as the Board may determine. If at such adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for holding the meeting, the meeting shall be dissolved.
11.5 The chairman of the Board (if one is appointed) shall preside as chairman at every general meeting. If there is no chairman of the Board or at any meeting the chairman is not present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting, or is not willing to act as chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act, or if one Director only is present he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the chair, or if the chairman chosen retires from the chair, the Shareholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be chairman.
11.6 The chairman may, with the consent of any meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting), adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place as the meeting shall determine, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business which might lawfully have been transacted at the meeting had the adjournment not taken place. When a meeting is adjourned for fourteen days or more, at least seven clear days' Notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given specifying the time and place of the adjourned meeting but it shall not be necessary to specify in such notice the nature of the business to be transacted at the adjourned meeting and the general nature of the business to be transacted. Save as aforesaid, it shall be unnecessary to give notice of an adjournment.
11.7 If an amendment is proposed to any resolution under consideration but is in good faith ruled out of order by the chairman of the meeting, the proceedings on the substantive resolution shall not be invalidated by any error in such ruling. In the case of a resolution duly proposed as a special resolution, no amendment thereto (other than a mere clerical amendment to correct a patent error) may in any event be considered or voted upon.

12 VOTING
12.1 Subject to any special rights or restrictions as to voting for the time being attached to any shares by or in accordance with the Memorandum or these Articles, at any general meeting (i) on a show of hands each Shareholders present in person (or being a corporation, is present by a representative duly authorised under Article 14) or by proxy, and each holder of a preference share who has a right to vote on the resolution and who is present in person (or being a corporation, is present by a representative duly authorised under Article 14), shall have one vote and the chairman of the meeting shall determine which proxy shall be entitled to vote where a Shareholder is represented by two proxies, and (ii) on a poll every Shareholder present in person or by proxy (or in the case of a Shareholder being a corporation, by its duly authorised representative), and each holder of a preference share who has a right to vote on the resolution, shall have one vote for every fully paid share of which he is the holder. A resolution put to the vote of a meeting shall, be decided on a show of hands unless (before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll) a poll is demanded:
(a) by the chairman of such meeting;
(b) by at least three Shareholders present in person (or in the case of a Shareholder being a corporation by its duly authorised representative) or by proxy for the time being entitled to vote at the meeting;
(c) by Shareholders present in person (or in the case of a Shareholder being a corporation by its duly authorised representative) or by proxy and representing not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all Shareholders having the right to vote at the meeting; or
(d) by Shareholders present in person (or in the case of a Shareholder being a corporation by its duly authorised representative) or by proxy and holding at least one-tenth o f the shares in the Company conferring a right to vote at the meeting.
A demand by a person as proxy for a Shareholder (or in the case of a Shareholder being a corporation by its duly authorised representative) shall be deemed to be the same as a demand by a Shareholder.
12.2 Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has been carried, or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or not carried by a particular majority, or lost, and an entry to that effect made in the minute book of the Company, shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded for or against the resolution.
12.3 If a poll is duly demanded the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded.
12.4 A poll demanded on the election of a chairman, or on a question of adjournment, shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner (including the use of ballot or voting papers or tickets) and either forthwith or at such time (being not later than thirty days after the date of the demand) and place as the chairman

Legal - 11273664.211

110136 v?3j

+431

directs. It shall not be necessaiy (unless the chairman otherwise directs) for notice to be given of a poll not taken immediately.

12.5 The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting or the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded, and, with the consent of the chairman, it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier.

12.6 On a poll votes may be given either personally or by proxy.

12.7 A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way.

12.8 In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of such meeting shall be entitled to a second or casting vote in addition to any other vote he may have.

12.9 Where there are joint holders of any share, each of them may be present in person or by proxy at a general meeting and may speak as a Shareholder. If only one of the joint holders is present in person or by proxy, he may vote in respect of such Share as if he were solely entitled thereto, but if more than one such joint holders be present at any meeting the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders, and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register in respect of the joint holding. Several executors or administrators of a deceased Shareholder in whose name any share stands shall for the purposes of this Article be deemed joint holders thereof.

12.10

A Shareholder who is a patient for any purpose relating to mental health or in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction for the protection or management of the affairs of persons incapable of managing their own affairs may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person in the nature of a receiver, committee or curator bonis appointed by such court, and such receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person may vote on a poll by proxy, and may otherwise act and be treated as if he were the registered holder of such shares for the purposes of general meetings, provided that such evidence as the Board may require of the authority of the person claiming to vote shall have been deposited at the Office or head office, as appropriate, not less than forty-eight hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting, or adjourned meeting or poll, as the case may be.

12.11

Any person entitled under Article 8.3 to be registered as the holder of any Shares may vote at any general meeting in respect thereof in the same manner as if he were the registered holder of such shares, provided that forty-eight hours at least before the time of the holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting, as the case may be, at which he proposes to vote, he shall satisfy the Board of his entitlement to such shares, or the Board shall have previously admitted his right to vote at such meeting in respect thereof.

12.12 No Shareholder shall, unless the Board otherwise determines, be entitled to attend and vote and to be reckoned in a quorum at any general meeting unless he is duly registered.

12.13 If:

legal -11273664,2f

110126 v7^j

44}

-16-

(a) any objection shall be raised to the qualification of any voter;
(b) any votes have been counted which ought not to have been counted or which might have been rejected; or
(c) any votes are not counted which ought to have been counted;
the objection or error shall not vitiate the decision of the meeting or adjourned meeting on any resolution unless the same is raised or pointed out at the meeting or, as the case may be, the adjourned meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tendered or at which the error occurs. Any objection or error shall be referred to the chairman of the meeting and shall only vitiate the decision of the meeting on any resolution if the chairman decides that the same may have affected the decision of the meeting. The decision of the chairman on such matters shall be final and conclusive.
13 PROXIES
13.1 Any Shareholder entitled to attend and vote at a meeting of the Company who is the holder of two or more shares shall be entitled to appoint not more than two proxies to attend, speak and vote instead of him at the same general meeting.
13.2 In any case where an instrument of proxy appoints more than one proxy the proportion of the shareholding concerned to be represented by each proxy shall be specified in the instrument of proxy.
13.3 A proxy need not be a Shareholder. In addition, subject to Article 13.1 a proxy representing either a Shareholder who is an individual or a Shareholder which is a corporation shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the Shareholder which he represent as such Shareholder could exercise, including, notwithstanding Article 13.1, the right to vote individually on a show of hands. On a poll, a proxy need not use all the votes he is entitled to cast or cast all such votes in the same way.
13.4 The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing under the hand of the appointor or of his attorney duly authorised in writing or, if the appointor is a corporation, either under its seal or under the hand of an officer, attorney or other person authorised to sign the same. In the case of an instrument of proxy purporting to be signed on behalf of a corporation by an officer thereof it shall be assumed, unless the contrary appears, that such officer was duly authorised to sign such instrument of proxy on behalf of the corporation without further evidence of the fact.
13.5 The instrument appointing a proxy and (if required by the Board) the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed on behalf of the appointor, or a certified copy of such power or authority, shall be delivered to such place or one of such places (if any) as may be specified for that purpose in or by way of note to or in any document accompanying the notice convening the meeting (or, if no place is so specified at the Office) not less than forty eight hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote or, in the case of a poll taken subsequently to the date of a meeting or adjourned meeting, not less than twenty four hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll and in default the instrument of proxy shall not be treated as valid. No instrument appointing a proxy shall be valid after the

Legal - 11273664.2t1

110116 vT^j

-17-
expiration of twelve months from the date named in it as the date of its execution, except at an adjourned meeting or on a poll demanded at a meeting or an adjourned meeting in cases where the meeting was originally held within twelve months from such date. Delivery of an instrument appointing a proxy shall not preclude a Shareholder from attending and voting in person at the meeting convened and in such event, the instrument appointing a proxy shall be deemed to be revoked.
13.6 Instruments of proxy shall be in any usual or common form or in such other form as the Board may approve (provided that this shall not preclude the use of the two way form) and the Board may, if it thinks fit, send out with the notice of any meeting forms of instrument of proxy for use at the meeting. The instrument of proxy shall be deemed to confer authority to demand or join in demanding a poll and to vote on any amendment o f a resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks fit. The instrument of proxy shall, unless the contrary is stated therein, be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates.
13.7 A vote given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy shall be valid notwithstanding the previous death or insanity of the principal, or revocation of the instrument of proxy or of the authority under which it was executed, provided that no intimation in writing of such death, insanity or revocation shall have been received by the Company at the Office (or such other place as may be specified for the delivery of instruments of proxy in the notice convening the meeting or other document sent therewith) two hours at least before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting, or the taking of the poll, at which the instrument of proxy is used.
13.8 Anything which under these Articles a Shareholder may do by proxy he may likewise do by his duly appointed attorney and the provisions of these Articles relating to proxies and instruments appointing proxies shall apply mutatis mutandis in relation to any such attorney and the instrument under which such attorney is appointed.
14 CORPORATIONS ACTING BY REPRESENTATIVES
14.1 Any corporation which is a Shareholder may by resolution of its directors or other governing body authorise such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the Company or at any meeting of any class of Shareholders. The person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of such corporation as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual Shareholder and such corporation shall for the purposes of these Articles be deemed to be present in person at any such meeting if a person so authorised is present thereat.
14.2 Any reference in these Articles to a duly authorised representative of a Shareholder being a corporation shall mean a representative authorised under the provisions of this Article.

15 WRITTEN RESOLUTIONS OF SHAREHOLDERS
Subject to the Act, a resolution in writing signed (in such manner as to indicate, expressly or impliedly, unconditional approval) by or on behalf of all persons for the time being entitled to receive notice of and to attend and vote at general meetings of the Company shall, for the purposes of these Articles, be treated as a resolution duly passed at a general meeting of the Company and, where relevant, as a special resolution so passed. Any such resolution shall be deemed to have been passed at a meeting held on the date on which it was signed by the last Shareholder to sign, and where the resolution states a date as being the date of his signature thereof by any Shareholder the statement shall be prima facie evidence that it was signed by him on that date. Such a resolution may consist of several documents in the like form, each signed by one or more relevant Shareholder.
16 BOARD OF DIRECTORS
16.1 The Directors may from time to time by ordinary resolution increase or reduce the maximum number of Directors on the Board provided, however, that the number of Directors shall not be fewer than one and shall not be more than twelve. All Directors shall be natural persons.

16.3 Neither a Director nor an alternate Director shall be required to hold any Shares by way of qualification and a Director or alternate Director (as the case may be) who is not a Shareholder shall be entitled to receive notice of and to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company and of all classes of Shares.
16.4 A Director may be removed from office, with or without cause, at any time before the expiration of his period of office notwithstanding anything in these Articles or in any agreement between the Company and such Director (but without prejudice to any claim for damages under any such agreement):
(a) by the Shareholders, at a general meeting called for the purpose of removing the Director or for other purposes, including the removal of the Director, and held in accordance with these Articles, by ordinary resolution, or by resolution in writing; passed by at least seventy-five per cent, of the Shareholders entitled to vote, in accordance with these Articles; or
(b) by the Board, at a meeting called for the purpose of removing the Director or for other purposes, including the removal of the Director, and held in accordance with these Articles, by majority vote, or by resolution in writing signed by all Directors except the Director to be removed.

16.6 A vacancy on the Board created by the removal of a Director under the provisions of 16.4 (a) above may be fdled by the election or appointment of a person as a Director by the remaining Directors at the meeting at which, or by the resolution in writing passed by which, such Director is removed.
16.7 Any Director appointed by the Directors, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director, shall retire at the next annual general meeting of the Company and shall then be eligible for re-election at that meeting.
17 RETIREMENT OF DIRECTORS
17.1 Each Director shall retire at least once every three years and for this purpose, at each annual general meeting, one-third of the Directors for the time being (or, if their number is not a multiple of three, the number nearest to but not less than one-third) shall retire from office by rotation provided that any Director appointed by the Directors either to fill a vacancy or as additional director shall not be taken into account in determining the number of Directors who are to retire by rotation.
17.2 The Directors to retire by rotation shall be those Directors who have been longest in office since their last re-election or appointment and so that as between persons who became or were last re-elected Directors on the same day those to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot. A retiring Director shall be eligible for re-election.
17.3 The Company at the meeting at which a Director retires under any provision of these Articles may by Resolution of Members fill the office being vacated by electing thereto the retiring Director or some other person eligible for appointment. In default the retiring Director shall be deemed to have been re-elected except in any of the following cases:

If any question as aforesaid shall arise in respect of the chairman of the meeting such question shall be decided by a resolution of the Board (for which purpose such chairman shall not vote thereon) and such resolution shall be final and conclusive except in a case where the nature or extent of the interest of such chairman as known to such chairman has not been fairly disclosed to the Board.

No Distribution shall be authorised or made unless the Board is satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately after the Distribution is made, the value of the Company's assets exceeds the value of its liabilities and the Company is able to pay its debts as they fall due. Distributions by way of dividend may be paid in money, shares or other property.
32.3 If the Company distributes to Shareholders (either generally or to specific classes of Shareholders) securities in any body corporate or trust (whether as a dividend or otherwise and whether or not for value), each such Shareholder appoints the Company as his agent to do anything needed to give effect to that distribution, including agreeing to become a member of that other body corporate.
32.4 The Board may from time to time make to the Shareholders such interim Distribution as appear to the Board to be justified by the profits of the Company and in particular (but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) if at any time the Company has in issue more than one class of shares, the Board may pay such interim Distributions in respect of those Shares which confer on the holders thereof deferred or non-preferential rights as well as in respect of those shares which confer on the holders thereof preferential rights with regard to Distribution and provided that the Board acts bona fide the Board shall not incur any responsibility to the holders of shares conferring any preference for any damage that they may suffer by reason of the payment of an interim Distribution on any shares having deferred or non-preferential rights and may also pay any fixed Distribution which is payable on any Shares half-yearly or on any other dates, whenever such profits, in the opinion of the Board, justifies such payment.

32.9 Whenever the Board has resolved that a dividend be paid or declared, the Board may further resolve that such dividend be satisfied wholly or in part by the distribution of specific assets of any kind and in particular of paid up shares, debentures or warrants to subscribe for securities of the Company or any other company, or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard to the distribution the Board may settle the same as it thinks expedient, and in particular may issue certificates in respect of fractions of shares, disregard fractional entitlements or round the same up or down, and may fix the value for distribution of such specific assets, or any part thereof, and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Shareholder upon the footing of the value so fixed in order to adjust the rights of all parties, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Board and may appoint any person to sign any requisite instruments of transfer and other documents on behalf of the persons entitled to the dividend, and such appointment shall be effective and binding on the Shareholders.

-36-

(iv) the dividend (or that part of the dividend to be satisfied by the allotment of shares as aforesaid) shall not be payable in cash on shares in respect whereof the cash election has not been duly exercised ("the non-elected shares") and in satisfaction thereof shares of the relevant class shall be allotted credited as fully paid up to the holders of the non-elected shares on the basis of allotment determined as aforesaid and for such purpose the Board shall capitalise and apply out of any part of the undivided profits of the Company (including profits carried and standing to the credit of any reserves or other special account, share premium account) as the Board may determine, such sum as may be required to pay up in full the appropriate number of shares of the relevant class for allotment and distribution to and amongst the holders of the non-elected shares on such basis; or

(b) that the Shareholders entitled to such dividend shall be entitled to elect to receive an allotment of shares credited as fully paid up in lieu of the whole or such part of the dividend as the Board may think fit. In such case, the following provisions shall apply:

(i) the basis of any such allotment shall be determined by the Board;

(ii) the Board, after determining the basis of allotment, shall give not less than two weeks' Notice to the holders of the relevant shares of the right of election accorded to them and shall send with such notice forms of election and specify the procedure to be followed and the place at which and the latest date and time by which duly completed forms of election must be lodged in order to be effective;

32.11

The shares allotted pursuant to the provisions of Article 32.10 shall rank pari passu in all respects with shares of the same class (if any) then in issue save only as regards participation in the relevant dividend or in any other distributions, bonuses or rights paid, made, declared or announced prior to or contemporaneously with the payment or declaration of the relevant dividend unless, contemporaneously with the announcement by the Board of their proposal to apply the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (2) of this Article in relation

32.12

The Board may do all acts and things considered necessary or expedient to give effect to any capitalisation pursuant to the provisions of this Article, with full power to the Board to make such provisions as it thinks fit in the case of shares becoming distributable in fractions (including provisions whereby, in whole or in paid, fractional entitlements are aggregated and sold and the net proceeds distributed to those entitled, or are disregarded or rounded up or down or whereby the benefit of fractional entitlements accrues to the Company rather than to the Shareholders concerned). The Board may authorise any person to enter into on behalf of all Shareholders interested, an agreement with the Company providing for such capitalisation and matters incidental thereto and any agreement made pursuant to such authority shall be effective and binding on all concerned.

32.13

The Company may upon the recommendation of the Board by ordinary resolution resolve in respect of any one particular dividend of the Company that a dividend may be satisfied wholly in the form of an allotment of shares credited as fully paid up without offering any right to shareholders to elect to receive such dividend in cash in lieu of such allotment.

32.14

The Board may on any occasion determine that rights of election and the allotment of shares shall not be made available or made to any Shareholders with registered addresses in any territory where, in the absence of a registration statement or other special formalities, the circulation of an offer of such rights of election or the allotment of shares would or might, in the opinion of the Board, be unlawful or impracticable, and in such event the provisions aforesaid shall be read and construed subject to such determination. Shareholders affected as a result of the foregoing sentence shall not be or be deemed to be a separate class of Shareholders for any purpose whatsoever.

32.15

Any resolution declaring a dividend on shares o f any class, whether a resolution o f the Company in general meeting or a resolution of the Board, may specify that the same shall be payable or distributable to the persons registered as the holders of such shares at the close of business on a particular date, notwithstanding that it may be a date prior to that on which the resolution is passed, and thereupon the dividend shall be payable or distributable to them in accordance with their respective holdings so registered, but without prejudice to the rights inter se in respect of such dividend of transferors and transferees of any such shares. The provisions of this Article shall mutatis mutandis apply to bonuses, capitalisation issues or offers or grants made by the Company to the Shareholders.

33 RESERVES

Before recommending any Distributions, the Board may set aside out of the profits of the Company such sums as it determines as reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Board, be applicable for any purpose to which the profits of the Company may be properly applied and pending such application may, also at such discretion, either be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such investments as the Board may from time to time think fit and so that it shall not be necessary to keep any investments constituting the reserve or reserves separate or distinct from any other investments of the Company. The Board may also without placing the same to reserve cany forward any profits which it may think prudent not to distribute.
