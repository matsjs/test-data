NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
To the bondholders in: ISIN NO 001031608.6 - 9.75 per cent Petromena ASA Callable Bond Issue 2006/2012 (the
"9.75% Bond Loan")
Oslo, 16 May 2012
Notice from Norwegian Securities Depository (the "VPS") prolonged maturity date Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed as loan trustee for the holders of bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond loan. The Bondholders have from VPS received a notice regarding the upcoming final maturity date for the 9.75% Bond Loan on 25 May 2012. This is the original maturity date that is still registered with VPS. However - as the Bondholders are informed of - was the entire 9.75% Bond Loan on 3 April 2012 declared to be in default and due for immediate payment. Following the acceleration of the loan the Bondholders have received several payments. There will however not be made any payments to the Bondholders on the 25 May 2012. As there is expected that further payments will be made to the Bondholders in the future will the maturity date in VPS - purely for practical reasons - be prolonged by 1 year - to 25 May 2013 (the "New Maturity Date"). In addition to facilitate future payments to the Bondholders the extension of the maturity date will make trading and transactions connected to the bonds easier. When the New Maturity Date is approaching the Bondholders will probably receive a new notice from VPS. Further extension of the maturity date will be considered on that point in time. Bondholders requesting further information may contact Norsk Tillitsmann ASA.
Kind regards Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
