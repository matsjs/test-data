The information in this Notice regarding the Issuer and market conditions is provided by the Issuer, and the Agent expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. Background
At the request by the Issuer, the Agent initiated on 18 June 2015 a procedure in writing under the Terms and Conditions relating to certain waivers and amendments to the Terms and Conditions (the "Waiver and Amendment Request").
The Waiver and Amendment Request included a request for a waiver from the obligation to list the Bonds within 12 months from the issue date of the Bonds. In consideration for the waiver, the Issuer agreed to an undertaking to have the Bonds listed no later than 30 September 2015. On 8 July 2015, the written procedure was closed and it was found that a requisite majority of the Bondholders had given their consent to the waivers and amendments requested in the Waiver and Amendment Request.
The process of listing the Bonds with Nasdaq OMX was originally initiated by the Issuer during early 2015 but temporarily put on-hold due to the events that eventually required waivers and consents from the Bondholders (as further described in the Waiver and Amendment Request). The process of listing the Bonds was reinitiated immediately after the Issuer had obtained the waivers and consents.
On 26 August 2015 the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway (the "FSAN") resolved that Oslo Børs shall delist the NOK 650,000,000 bonds (the "NOK-Bonds") of the Issuer from listing on Oslo Børs. The Issuer appealed this decision on 7 September 2015 and requested that the appeal be given suspensive effect, meaning that the delisting will be delayed until the appeal is decided. The FSAN on 8 September 2015 upheld its decision and declined to grant suspensive effect, and the matter was sent to the Norwegian Ministry of Finance, being the appeal instance. On 10 September 2015, the Ministry of Finance decided to grant the Issuer suspensive effect until the appeal is decided. It is not possible to predict how long the appeal process will take.
The Issuer has concluded that it will not be possible to successfully carry out a listing process while the appeal process is ongoing. The delay in the process will entail that the Issuer will be unable to fulfil its obligation to list the Bonds no later than 30 September 2015 (the "Anticipated Default").
The purpose of this Notice is to obtain a waiver from the Bondholders with respect to the Anticipated Default.
For further information about the background for this waiver request, please visit the Issuer's web site www.solorbioenergi.com
2. Waiver request
The Issuer requests that the Bondholders grant a waiver in respect of the Anticipated Default, subject only to the condition that the Issuer undertakes to use its best efforts

3 (7)
to procure that the Bonds are listed in accordance with Clause 12.5 (Listing of Bonds) no later than 30 June 2016 (the "Waiver Request"). Furthermore, the Issuer will continue to report information to the market in English in line with the rules and regulations generally applicable for listed bonds in Sweden.
3. NON-RELIANCE
The Waiver Request is presented to the Bondholders without evaluation or recommendations from the Agent. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the Waiver Request is acceptable or not.
4. THE WRITTEN PROCEDURE
The following instructions need to be adhered to under the Written Procedure.
4.1 Final date to participate in the Written Procedure
The Agent must have received the votes by mail, courier or email to the address indicated below no later than 17:00 (CET), 29 October 2015. Votes received thereafter may be disregarded.
4.2 Decision procedure
The Agent will determine if received replies are eligible to participate under the Written Procedure as valid votes.
When a requisite majority of consents of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount have been received by the Agent, the Waiver Request shall be deemed to be adopted, even if the time period for replies in the Written Procedure has not yet expired.
Information about the decision taken under the Written Procedure will: i) be sent by notice to the Bondholders and ii) be published on the websites of a) the Issuer and b) the Agent.
A matter decided under the Written Procedure will be binding for all Bondholders, irrespective of them responding in the Written Procedure.
4.3 Voting rights and authorisation
Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on the Record Date (6 October 2015) in the debt register:
(a) be registered as a direct registered owner of a Securities Account; or
(b) be registered as authorised nominee in a Securities Account, with respect to one or several Bonds.

4 (7)
4.4 Bonds registered with a nominee
If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Bonds are held through a registered authorised nominee or another intermediary, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the Bonds.
1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.
2. You can obtain a Power of Attorney (Schedule 2) from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorization. If you hold your Bonds through several intermediaries, you need to obtain authorization directly from the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as bondholder of the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of bondholders, starting with the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as a Bondholder of the Securities Account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.
Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).
The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Bonds are registered or need authorization or other assistance to participate. Bonds owned by the Issuer, another Group Company or an Affiliate do not entitle to any voting rights.
4.5 Quorum
To approve the Waiver Request, Bondholders representing at least fifty (50) per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount must reply to the Waiver request under the Written Procedure in order to form a quorum.
If a quorum does not exist, the Agent shall initiate a second Written Procedure, provided that the relevant proposal has not been withdrawn by the Issuer. No quorum requirement will apply to such second Written Procedure.
4.6 Majority
Two thirds (2/3) per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Bondholders reply under the Written Procedure must consent to the Waiver Request.
4.7 Address for sending replies
Return the Voting Form, Schedule 1, and, if applicable, the Power of Attorney/Authorisation in Schedule 2 or other sufficient evidence, if the Bonds are held in custody other than Euroclear Sweden, by regular mail, scanned copy by email, or by courier to:
