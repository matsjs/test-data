Bondholders in ISIN No 001 0724818 11.00% First Priority Oro Negro Impetus Pte. Ltd. Senior Secured Bond Issue 2014/2015 (the "2015 Bonds")
Dear 2015 Bondholders:
As you are aware, Oro Negro Impetus Pte. Ltd. (the "2015 Issuer") and Oro Negro Drilling Pte. Ltd. (the "2019 Issuer" and, together with the 2015 Issuer and their affiliate companies, "Oro Negro"), have been engaged in discussions with ad hoc committees o f bondholders for both the 2015 Bonds and the 7.50% First Priority Oro Negro Drilling Pte. Ltd. Senior Secured Bond Issue 2014/2019 (the "2019 Bonds") regarding a global restructuring o f Oro Negro's capital structure. The terms o f the global restructuring are set forth in a proposal contained in the summons you are receiving and the attached amended bond agreement (the "Global Restructuring Proposal"). In essence, the Global Restructuring Proposal contemplates combining both the 2015 Bonds and the 2019 Bonds into a single bond.
Oro Negro believes that the Global Restructuring Proposal is the course o f action with the best possible outcome under the circumstances for the 2015 Bonds and that it will give Oro Negro's management team the ability to stabilize operations and guide Oro Negro through the challenges brought on by the collapse o f global oil prices. Oro Negro requests that the holders SUPPORT the Global Restructuring Proposal.
Over the last year, Oro Negro has supported and invested in the Impetus rig despite the turbulent market conditions. The Impetus rig is now under contract with Pemex and ready for mobilization, and our hope is that it will begin operating soon. If the Global Restructuring Proposal is not adopted, we are not certain that Pemex will continue to support the Impetus. Without the Pemex contract, Oro Negro believes that the value o f the Impetus will be materially less, resulting in a decreased recovery for the 2015 Bonds. Oro Negro's liquidity has become dangerously low, and although the 2019 Bonds released a limited amount o f cash from their blocked accounts last week, Oro Negro presently requires additional liquidity as soon as possible or it will be unable to continue operations. Furthermore, the 2019 Bonds have no obligation to fund the continued operation o f the Impetus rig, and there will be an extended delay before any revenue is available from Pemex.
W e believe that the terms o f the restructuring are beneficial to holders o f both the 2015 Bonds and the 2019 Bonds, and we urge the bondholders to approve the Global Restructuring Propuo^al to permit Oro Negro's management team the ability to stabilize operations and guide Oro Negr^through/me^h^pllenges brought on by the collapse o f global oil prices.
