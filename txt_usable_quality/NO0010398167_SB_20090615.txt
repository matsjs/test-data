and accordingly Artumas believes it is in the best interest of all stakeholders that the proposed Bondholders' meetings on 29 May should be deferred.
Artumas has for this reason elected to cancel the Bondholders' meetings scheduled for 29 May and to reschedule the Bondholders' meetings for Monday 15 June 2009 at 13:00 hours CEL
A revised summons to Bondholders' meetings is attached. The only changes relate to the new date for the meeting and consequential changes to other dates in the document and the proposal for resolutions.

For further information, please contact the Company's Advisor, DnB NOR Markets (the "Advisor"):
Einar Wold (einar.wold@dnbnor.no / +47 22 01 77 88); Preben Grevstad (preben.grevstad@dnbnor.no / +47 22 94 88 98); Frode Sævig (frode.savig@dnbnor.no / +47 22 94 81 32) or; Pål Vammervold (pal.vammervold@dnbnor.no / +47 22 01 77 64)

No due diligence investigations have been carried out by the Advisor with respect to the Company and the Advisor expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the Proposal (including but not limited to the information contained herein and in the attached revised summons).
3. PROPOSAL
The Company proposes that the Bondholders convert the total outstanding principal amount of the Loans, including accrued but unpaid interest as at 11 June 2009, into common shares in Artumas and that interest no longer accrue from said date (the "Proposal").
The total principal amount outstanding in the Loans is USD 115,000,000, plus accrued unpaid interest which amounts to USD 2,365,417 per 11 June 2009.
The Proposal implies that the Loans including accrued but unpaid interest up to 11 June 2009 (with no further interest accruing from such date) shall be converted to common shares in Artumas at a conversion price of NOK 1 per share based on a USD/NOK exchange rate of 6.4130, which was the exchange rate on 11 May 2009 at 12.00 CET (the "Conversion").

NORSIC TILLITSMANN ASA
www.t nisu'c'.no
Following the Conversion, 752,664,417 new common shares will be issued to the Bondholders (as a whole number of shares will be issued to each Bondholder, the number may be subject to minor adjustment), representing approximately a 95.5 per cent shareholding in Artumas post-completion of the Conversion. The shareholding in Artumas will then be divided between existing shareholders and former Bondholders as follows:

Existing shareholders 2009 Bond 2010 Bond 2012 Bond Total # of shares

Shares 35 ,816,987 6 7 ,1 4 1 ,4 3 8 2 3 5 ,1 1 6 ,6 1 3 45 0,4 06 ,36 7 7 8 8 ,4 8 1 ,4 0 4

% ow nership 4.5 % 8.5 % 29.8 % 57.1 % 100 %

In order to secure the Company's funding requirements, an invitation to subscribe in a private placement (the "Private Placement") of USD 20 to 30 million will be made to certain existing shareholders, the Bondholders, and potential new investors. The subscription price in the Private Placement shall not be lower than NOK 0.25 per share.

The Company will, following the Private Placement, consider to conduct a subsequent offering of up to USD 10 million (the "Subsequent Offering") to all shareholders (being shareholders prior to the Conversion) who were not invited to participate in the Private Placement (subject to applicable securities law which may restrict such offering and subscription into and from certain jurisdictions). The price in the Subsequent Offering will be equal to the subscription price in the Private Placement. The amount raised in the Private Placement and the Subsequent Offering will thus, in aggregate, not exceed USD 40 million.

The table below shows the shareholdings in Artumas post the Conversion and post the Private Placement and the Subsequent Offering in different scenarios depending on amount of equity and with a pricing, for illustrative purposes, of NOK 0.25 per share in the Private Placement and the Subsequent Offering (since the size of the equity offerings are indicated in USD, the number of shares emerging from the Private Placement and the Subsequent Offering will depend on the USD/NOK exchange rate at the time of settlement):

* The above table does not include any outstanding options under the Company's share option program (the details of which are

disclosed in the Company's financial statements).

Further, the Borrower proposes that the Bondholders waive their rights to declare the Loans to be in default (and to forebear acceleration of the Loans) due to a noncompliance by the Borrower of the obligations in Clause 16.1 (h), (i) and (j) of the Loan Agreement for the 2009 Bond and the 2010 Bond, with regard to Equity Ratio, Equity and Net Current Assets up until 30 June 2009, and in Clause 16.3 with regard to Equity

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
www. im srcc.no

Ratio, Equity and Working Capital and Clause 18.1(d)(i) of the Loan Agreement for the 2012 Bond, in the period up until 15 July 2009.

The Proposal is subject to the Private Placement of minimum USD 20 million and maximum USD 30 million being fully subscribed within 24 June 2009 and fully paid in on or about 3 July 2009.

The Proposal is further subject to approval of the shareholders of the Borrower. A general meeting is for this purpose scheduled to be held on or about 29 June 2009.

Furthermore, the Proposal is subject to the approval from the Bondholders' Meetings in all three Loans.

Tentative time schedule:

15 June: Bondholders' meetings

29 June: General meeting in Artumas

6 July:

Settlement of shares from conversion and private placement

For further information about the Company, please refer to its web site www.artumas.com.

4. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES
4.1 The Company's evaluation
Artumas believes it is in the best interest of all stakeholders to consider the Proposal set forth herein, which could result in Artumas having a clean balance sheet being able to raise new capital, and could ensure that Artumas avoids having to obtain creditor protection or be wound-up. In order to attract new capital through an equity issue, a debt-free balance sheet is deemed necessary. According to Artumas, the Proposal is the result of an intense review process by the Company, and after having reviewed all potential alternatives, the Company believes this Proposal is in the best interest of the Company. With a clean balance sheet, following an approval of the conversion of all the Loans to equity, Artumas and its Advisor would seek to offer new shares to certain existing shareholders, its Bondholders as well as potential new investors through a private placement.
Artumas therefore proposes that the Bondholders convert the total outstanding principal amount of the Loans (which are all unsecured), including accrued but unpaid interest as at 11 June 2009, into common shares in Artumas and that interest no longer accrue from said date.
4.2 The Loan Trustee's evaluation
The Loan Trustee would have preferred that the Bondholders had been given more information of the economical situation of the Company, as requested by the Loan Trustee. Based on the information provided by the Company herein and in the

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
www. trustee, no
Corporate Update dated 12 May 2009, the Loan Trustee is not in a position to make any recommendation with regard to the Proposal, and the Proposal is, consequently, put forward without any further evaluations or recommendation from the Loan Trustee.
The Bondholders must independently evaluate, based on available information, whether the Proposal is acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders counsel with tax and other advisors regarding the effects and possible consequences of the Proposal. All Bondholders must be aware that even if the Proposal is accepted, the Company still has challenges going forward and the Company might be unable to meet its commitments in the future.
The Loan Trustee also points out that the Proposal is a proposal presented to the Loan Trustee by the Borrower and that the Loan Trustee has not been involved in negotiations or had any influence on the Proposal.

Bondholders may be represented in person or by proxy.
Please find attached as Exhibit 1 a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' meeting. (If the Bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered).
The individual Bondholder may authorize the Loan Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorizing the Loan Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Loan Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Loan Trustee as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
