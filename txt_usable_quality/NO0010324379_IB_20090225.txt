To the bondholders in:

ISIN: NO 001032437.9 - FRN Peterson AS Open Bond Issue 2006/2010 with Call Option

Bond issue - renegotiation

Oslo, 24 February 2009

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the bond issue with ISIN NO001032437.9 (the "Loan") issued by Peterson AS (the "Borrower" or the "Company"). All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement (the "Loan Agreement").
As the Bondholders have been informed, the scheduled bondholders meeting due on 6 February 2009 was cancelled by the Borrower. As it appeared from the summons to the bondholders meeting the Borrower - in order to bridge an expected cash shortfall wants to propose for the Bondholders to make certain amendments to the Loan Agreement.
Subsequent to the cancellation of the bondholders meeting the Company has entered into further discussions with the Bondholders through the Loan Trustee and the Company's advisors in order to bring forward a proposal that is acceptable to both the Bondholders and to the Company.
To make the discussions more efficient a group of Bondholders representing a decisive majority in the Loan have formed a bondholders committee. The Loan Trustee remains in close contact with the bondholders committee as well as the Borrower and is of the opinion that all parties involved have a constructive attitude towards finding a solution for the Company and its creditors.
When the discussions between the Borrower and the Bondholders have been concluded a new bondholders meeting will be summoned in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement

Yours Sincerely,

Hans Bernhard Lind
