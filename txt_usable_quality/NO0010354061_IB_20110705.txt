Main features of the winding-up proceedings since the previous report

Reference is made to the preliminary report dated 16 September 2009 and to the annual report dated 6 October 2010, The reports must be read in conjunction with each other. The information in the preliminary report will not be repeated unless this is expedient for presentation purposes.

Enclosed with this report is the estate auditor's report dated 30 May 2011, That report is an independent report, and the creditors will already be aware of some of the matters mentioned in it. However, this report also points to some matters which the estate has not given priority to pointing out in our previous reports. Some of these matters are commented on in section 4 below. We ask to be kept informed should the creditors wish further clarification of other matters that have been raised.

The estate's work since the annual report has mostly consisted of following up the settlement agreement and claims against TTS Sense AS and TTS Group ASA, as well as realising assets in the debtor's subsidiaries. The estate in liquidation has reviewed all material claims and carried out an interim distribution of dividend to the creditors in question.

As in previous reports, this report will only deal with important matters, and issues that are less important by comparison will not be dealt with.

4.

The work of the estate auditor

4.1. Introduction As mentioned above, the estate auditor has completed his report. Important matters in this report that give rise to comments from the estate in liquidation will be discussed in the following chapter.

4.2. Claim against DnB NOR entered in the accounts - section 7.3 of the report It is stated in section 7.3 of the auditor's report that the debtor had entered a claim against DnB NOR Bank ASA in its accounts following the transfer of an amount to the bank. The estate in liquidation has looked into the matter, which was related to use of the company's credit card. It has now been clarified that the debtor has no claim against DnB NOR Bank ASA, but that the bank had an amount outstanding with the debtor on commencement of the winding-up proceedings. However, the bank notified the estate of its claim at an earlier time.

4.3. Payments to Drilltools International FZCO - sections 7.4 and 7,8 of the report Work was in progress on onshore rig no 1 at this shipyard in Dubai when the windingup proceedings commenced. The yard exercised its possessory lien against the rig and equipment until the amount owed to it was settled. The amount owed to the yard was reviewed, negotiated and settled as part of the purchase price on transfer of the

Translation from Norwegian

3

onshore rig. All outstanding accounts between the yard and the rigowning company Ability Drilling Malta III Jordan Ltd had thus been settled on transfer of the rig.

Prior to the commencement of winding-up proceedings, the subsidiaries in Malta had entered into management agreements with Ability Drilling ASA in the manner already described. This entailed, among other things, that nearly all invoices were received and paid by Ability Drilling ASA, which then invoiced the subsidiary in question. This was also done in the case of the relevant claims from Drilltools International FZCO.

The estate in liquidation sees no reason to file legal claims in connection with the disbursements to Drilltools International FZCO immediately prior to the commencement of the winding-up proceedings and partly after the suspension of payments. The main reason for this is that these were payments for services rendered on a running basis, and also that Ability Drilling Malta Jordan Ltd, and subsequently Ability Drilling ASA, have suffered no financial loss as a result of these payments. If these invoice claims had not been paid, it would have resulted in a corresponding amount, plus interest, being deducted from the purchase price in order for the rig to be released.

4.4. Payment to KAN Int Petroleum Services - sections 7.5 and 7.7 of the report Ability Drilling Malta III Jordan Ltd. had signed an agreement to rent premises in Jordan. Payments to KAN int Petroleum Services were disbursed by Ability Drilling ASA and then invoiced to Ability Drilling III Jordan Ltd. in accordance with the management agreements, cf. section 4.2. As in the relationship with Drilltools International FZCO, the consequence of a claim for reversal would have been that the same claim would have been made against Ability Drilling Malta III Jordan Ltd, which in turn would have reduced the assets transferred from the company to the estate.

Ability Drilling Malta Ltd had previously signed an agreement with the company for consultancy services, which, as far as the estate in liquidation is informed, had mostly been performed before the commencement of winding-up proceedings. However, Ability Drilling Malta Jordan 111 Ltd needed certain services, such as supervision of equipment etc. in Jordan, and the company continued to carry out such services after the commencement of the winding-up proceedings.

4.5. Repurchase of bonds, relationship with closely related parties - section 7.12 of the report The background to the estate in liquidation's petition of 23 July 2010 for depositions from employees of the brokerage firms involved is explained in section 9 of the annual report dated 6 October 2010. Information was also given about the statement from Pareto Securities AS to the effect that two international banks were the counterparts in Pareto Securities AS's purchase of bonds in the bond issue that were subsequently sold to Ability Drilling ASA.

The estate in liquidation has not been informed of Fearnely Fonds ASA's comment on

the petition, but the estate has previously been informed thatJLwgs an American

investment bank's holding that was transferred to Ability Drilling ASA via the brokerage firm. This information, plus information given in by Ability Drilling ASA's former chair of the board and general manager during the meeting of creditors, indicated that there was no reason to uphold the estate in liquidation's petition for depositions to be taken. Moreover, the dispute with TTS, which was the party that expressed a wish for the matter to be further investigated, had been resolved through the settlement agreement. The petition was withdrawn following a vote in the bondholders' meeting where the matter of withdrawing the petition for depositions was among the items on the agenda.
4.6. Directors' liability - section 10.2 of the report The estate in liquidation has considered the question of whether it constituted a wrongful act involving liability in damages on the part of the company's board to repurchase bonds at the time in question and subject to the applicable conditions. In retrospect, there is no doubt that the company would have needed the liquidity spent on repurchases in autumn 2008 when the problems with the rigs persisted in 2009.

The matter had been considered by the administration, which recommended the repurchase. The board seems to have considered the matter thoroughly. Although the decision, particularly in retrospect, appears unwise, the estate in liquidation is of the opinion that it did nonetheless not constitute a wrongful act involving liability in damages.

Another matter is that it would anyway be difficult for the estate to demonstrate that the creditors have suffered any financial loss. There is nothing to suggest that the production of the rigs would have been completed and the rigs been functional even if Ability had had the funds available. The liquidation could thus not have been prevented under any circumstances. Moreover, the price for which the bonds were purchased corresponds roughly to, and is partly lower than, the total dividend that the estate expects to be able to distribute.

The estate is therefore of the opinion that there is no basis for pursuing compensation claims against the board on the basis of the decision to repurchase bonds.

5.

The relationship with TTS sense a s and t t s Group ASA

A thorough account of the dispute, the claims of the parties, the progress of the case and the settlement agreement was given in section 10 of the interim report and the same section in the annual report.

Reference is also made to the information provided in the liquidator's letter to the creditors of 18 November 2010. The settlement agreement and the result of the consideration of the settlement agreement in the bondholders' meeting held by Norsk Tillitsmann ASA were enclosed with the letter. As a result of the bondholders' meeting's approval of the settlement agreement, a majority of the estate's creditors

were in favour of the agreement. There was therefore no need for a separate vote of the creditors' meeting.

After this, TSS has signed an agreement with Weatherford Pipeline Services Spain S.L. concerning the rig and pertaining equipment. Ability has been in negotiations with TTS about consent for disposition and the question of what claim it would give rise to for the estate in liquidation. These questions have not yet been clarified, but TTS has transferred NOK 20,000,000, which will anyway be the minimum compensation to Ability for TTS's dispition of the rig. Ability has notified TTS that the claim will be pursued through the courts unless documentation is submitted to show that Ability's claim does not exceed this amount.

In accordance with clause 3 of the settlement agreement, interest on the stipulated purchase price must be paid in the amount of NOK 1 000 000 on 1 December 2010 and 1 March 2011, This interest has been paid. The interest that fell due for payment on 1 June 2011 was proportionately reduced as a result of the payment of NOK 20,000,000 of the principal sum, see above. The next due date for payment of interest is 1 September 2011. For any remaining interest payment periods, the instalment for the full principal has been increased to NOK 1,500,000.

6.

The estate's realisation work since the annual report - main features

6.1. Maintenance rigs in Canada In April 2011, Ability Drilling Malta Ltd and IO & R Ltd signed an agreement for the sale of two 150 T maintenance rigs with pertaining equipment. After adjustments for rightful claims, a change in liability relating to transport and an adjustment because IO & R Ltd. paid sooner than originally agreed, the purchase price was stipulated at NOK 50,250,000. The rigs and equipment were sold `as is, where is'. The deadline for claims was set to 11 August 2011.

The agreement also includes a `mud package' and a generator set for which the estate has had to make separate agreements in order to be able to offer the desired rig package.

For the unit defined as the `mud package', Ability Drilling Malta Ltd. entered into an agreement with Ml-Swaco AS/Schlumberger Norge for the company to supply a fungible and tested package in return for the transfer of NOK 6,050,000, and whereby the company at the same time withdrew its claim of NOK 13,307,766.26 against the estate in liquidation.

Ability also had to provide a generator set for NOK 1,500,000. This was finally arranged by IO & R Ltd purchasing this equipment directly from Mongstad Elektro AS in return for a corresponding reduction in the purchase price.

The buyer has also pointed out that a diesel tank that is supposed to be part of the equipment package for the maintenance rigs is missing. Ability is of the opinion that

Translation from Norwegian

6

this diesel tank should be handed over by TTS, but TTS has resisted this. As a result, Ability has had to accept that 10 & R Ltd will purchase a replacement tank for the estate's account at a price of up to NOK 400,000.

6.2. Repayment, reversal claims As mentioned in the previous annual report, the estate in liquidation entered into an agreement with the general manager for the reversible disbursement of holiday pay in the amount of NOK 177,693. The amount has been transferred to the, estate In accordance with the agreement.

6.3. Return of premium The debtor's insurance company stated that the estate in liquidation was entitled to a return of premium in the amount of NOK 29,242. Since it was indicated in section .6.3 of the auditor's report that a larger amount was owing to the estate than stated by the insurance company, the estate requested the insurance company's comments on the auditor's findings. The insurance company is still looking into this matter, and the amount of premium to be returned has therefore not yet been finally clarified.

6.4. Loans to employees As mentioned in the previous annual report for the year, the estate has entered into an agreement with a former employee concerning the repayment of a loan. The agreement has been complied with.

7.

Particular matters

7.1. Claim against Porosity Reference is made to section 5.2 of the annual report dated 6 October 2010. The estate has not received payment from Porosity. The estate will decide if and how to pursue this matter in the near future.

7.2. Reimbursement of value added ta x -th e Netherlands Ability Drilling Malta II Germany Ltd has filed a claim for reimbursement of value added tax that the company had paid to the Dutch authorities before the commencement of winding-up proceedings for Ability Drilling ASA. Reimbursement has been obtained for one payment period, but reimbursement claims totalling EUR 654,469 remain outstanding. This amount concerns value added tax on goods that have now been sold.

The Dutch VAT authorities have requested a detailed overview of what goods the paid-in VAT relates to, as well as a detailed overview of which goods have been sold and which, if any, are still In storage in the Netherlands. This is very time-consuming and complicated work for the estate, both as regards proving what the payments relate to and demonstrating in detail which goods had been sold before the commencement of winding-up proceedings.

Translation from Norwegian

7

The estate is cooperating with PwC in the Netherlands and hopes to clarify this matter within a few months.

7.3. Claims against a former employee Section 11.2 in the annual report dated 10 June 2010 describes the basis for a claim against a former employee. The matter was considered by Askøy Conciliation Board on 30 May 2011. The matter has become somewhat more elucidated in the course of the proceedings, and some of the documentation that the estate has requested has appeared. No settlement was reached in the case, and the former employee did not consent to a judgment being pronounced. The case has therefore been discontinued.

The estate is considering whether or not to pursue this matter.

7.4. Bonds The circumstances surrounding the repurchase of own bonds have been thoroughly described in previous reports. The estate in liquidation considers this part of the administration of the estate to have been completed, see section 4.5.

8.

The financial relationship between the subsidiaries and the debtor

Section 8 of the interim report explained how the subsidiaries established in Malta

had been financed. Among other things, it contained a description of the loan

agreements between Ability Drilling ASA and Ability Drilling Malta Ltd and between

Ability Drilling ASA and Ability Drilling Malta II Germany Ltd in the amount of EUR

18,047,118 and EUR 24,563,780, respectively. Both loans were interest-bearing, and

the interest corresponded to the interest rate agreed by Ability Drilling ASA in the

bond issue. The purpose of the loans was to fund the building of rigs to be owned by

the borrowing companies.

In addition to these loans, Ability Drilling ASA furnished credit to the subsidiaries in that many invoices were paid by Ability Drilling ASA before being invoiced to the subsidiary in question.

In connection with the transfer of ownership of the various rigs, the debtor has explained that the pertaining liabilities of the rigs in question were entered in the books as claims between subsidiaries. Thus, a claim in the amount of EUR 19,013,051 from Ability Drilling Malta Ltd against Ability Drilling Malta II Germany Ltd is entered for the transfer of onshore rigs no 1 and 2. Correspondingly, a claim from Ability Drilling Malta II Germany Ltd against Ability Drilling Malta III Jordan Ltd in the amount of EUR 16,869,135 is entered relating to onshore rig no 1.
Following the realisation of the assets, the purchase amounts were credited to the respective subsidiaries' accounts in DnB NOR Bank ASA. Since the subsidiaries had no other external creditors than the companies' advisors and accountants in Malta after the settlement agreement had been signed, the boards of directors of the companies in question decided to use some of the deposits in their accounts for

partial payment of the companies' internal liabilities, including the companies' loans, to the estate in liquidation of Ability Drilling ASA.

9.

The position and status of the estate in liquidation

9.1. Annual financial statements Please find the estate In liquidation's accounts as of 31 May 2011 enclosed with the annual report.

9.2. More about the group finances In addition to the account balance in the debtor (see the accounts), the subsidiaries have total cash and cash equivalents of approx. NOK 15,000,000. There is also NOK 2,550,000 in a frozen client account as security for any claims by 10 & R Ltd., money which will be transferred if no claims are received by 11 August 2011.

It is repeated that cash and cash equivalents include a provision in the amount of NOK 9,194,128 for potential payment of dividend to creditors who did not receive payment in the distribution on 2 May 2011 (see below).

The important claims that still exist in the subsidiaries are the residual settlement concerning the agreement with TTS (see section 5), the claim for reimbursement of value added tax from the Netherlands (see section 7.2.) and the residual claim concerning the sale of the maintenance rigs (see section 6.1.).

9.3. Accounts for subsidiaries Since the assets in the subsidiaries have now been sold, there is basis for concluding the accounts of the subsidiaries in the manner required to wind them up. This work will be given priority in the time ahead.

1o. Claims against the estate - distribution

10.1.

Examination of claims The estate notified the district court and the creditors of the examination of claims in a letter dated 7 March 2011 which contained the estate's list of claims filed and clarified by the estate. Claims that in the estate's opinion were unclarified in terms of basis and amount were recommended for postponed consideration. Provisions corresponding to payment of dividend for fully approved claims were made for the claims in question. These claims will undergo further examination and dividend, if any, will be distributed on a subsequent occasion, cf. the Bankruptcy Act section 111, third paragraph, second sentence.

The estate reviewed the claims on 21 March 2011. Since there was no coverage for claims without priority, such claims were not examined. The following claims were approved and provisions for them made:

Objections to the recommended claims were made by two of the creditors, but the objections were withdrawn after some correspondence.

An objection was also received from an employee who had been entered with a lower amount then he was entitled to in the liquidation committee's recommendation. However, the amount in question was low and the estate had counter-claims against the employee, so the objection had no bearing on the distribution. This will be adjusted in the next recommendation.

The estate also received a query from a wage-earner who, in retrospect, wished to claim a greater amount than the one approved by the estate during the examination of claims. The estate informed the person in question of the right to appeal to the district court pursuant to section 130 of the Bankruptcy Act, but no such appeal has been lodged.

For one creditor, certain clarifications were made before payment took place. Payment was therefore withheld. The estate will reconsider this matter in its next recommendation.

10.2.

Claims w ith class I and class II priority The estate recommended payment of claims with class l priority in the total amount of NOK 3,318,501. Most of these claims concern employees' claims for coverage of pay for May 2009, pay during their periods of notice and holiday pay for 2009, in addition to various claims for reimbursement for expenses. The estate deemed several of the items in the employees' claims not to be entitled to coverage pursuant to the Satisfaction of Claims Act. Other claims were re-classified as claims without priority. In its recommendation, the estate also reduced several claims by making deductions for other income during the application period.

Class I claims in the total amount of NOK 2,824,218 were approved for distribution, while, for the time being, a provision for dividend was made for nine claims totalling NOK 468,043. The estate has made provisions corresponding to 100% dividend for these claims.

Priority claims class I for which provisions have been made mostly comprise claims from foreign employees, in whose case it has so far not been possible to verify that they have had no other income during their periods of notice that should be deducted from their claims.

Claims with class II priority were recommended for approval in full

10.3.

Claims without priority The claims without priority were significantly reduced after the estate had reduced its bond debt, so that the claim from Norsk Tillitsmann ASA could be reduced correspondingly. Moreover, the claims from Ability Drilling Malta IV UK Ltd and MlSwaco AS lapsed as a result of the agreement entered into relating to the sale of the maintenance rigs, see section 6.1.

The estate recommended 92 claims without priority, totalling NOK 361,800,280.

It was decided to postpone the consideration of 28 claims totalling NOK 28,148,662. As mentioned, the estate has made provisions corresponding to a 31% dividend for such unclarified claims without priority.

10.4.

Interim distribution The liquidation committee found that there was basis for an interim distribution in the amount of NOK 123,187,315, including provisions for dividend in the case of claims that were not recommended in this round. Distribution took place on 2 May 2011 with the court's consent.

Claims with class I and class II priority were covered in full, while the dividend for claims without priority was 31%.

10.5.

Further distribution. As the estate obtains a basis for examining unclarified claims, a recommendation will be made and notification of examination of claims will be sent to the creditors by separate letter.

Further distribution to creditors with approved claims will thus take place as soon as there is a basis for it.

11. Criminal offences/period of disqualification

In connection with his review of the company's accounting in relation to tax withholdings, the auditor found that tax withholdings have not to a sufficient extent been transferred to the bank account for tax withholdings and that the company has also not complied with the applicable rules relating to tax withholdings, which means that the company has violated the Tax Payment Act section 5-12. In this connection, the estate notes that the company's management has maintained that there have always been sufficient funds in the tax withholdings account to cover advance payroll tax deductions. This was also the situation on commencement of wlnding-up proceedings. Consequently, the estate considers this to be a formal violation that will not be reported to the police.

No circumstances have been uncovered that would constitute grounds for imposing a period of disqualification.

1 2 . Further work - new distribution and dividend prospects
Now that a settlement agreement has been entered into with TTS whereby the estate no longer has title to onshore rigs no 2, 3 and 4 with pertaining equipment, this part of the administration of the estate in liquidation has been concluded. The remaining work now concerns collection of the claim against TTS.
Since the maintenance rigs have also been sold and paid for, see section 6.1, most of the assets have been realised.
Other remaining administration of the estate in liquidation mostly consists of collection of claims relating to value added tax in the Netherlands, and follow-up of a few other matters mentioned above.
Before the administration of the estate in liquidation can be concluded, the estate in liquidation's subsidiaries established in Malta must be wound up in accordance with Maltese law. The estate in liquidation plans to merge the companies Ability Drilling Malta Ltd, Ability Drilling Malta II Germany Ltd, Ability Drilling Malta III Jordan Ltd and Ability Drilling Malta IV UK Ltd into Ability Drilling Malta Holding Ltd, and then wind up Ability Drilling Malta Holding Ltd.
The company Ability Drilling GmbH is a wholly-owned German subsidiary of Ability Drilling ASA. This company must be wound up in accordance with German law if the estate does not succeed in selling the shares as a shelf company.
Further settlement from TTS will be decisive for any further distribution to the creditors. Since a dividend has been paid or provisions made for 100% dividend in the case of all claims with class I and class II priority, only distributions relating to claims without priority remain.
The estate aims for a total dividend payment to creditors without priority in excess of 45%.

INTRODUCTION

The estate in liuidation o fAbility Drilling Estate Auditor's Report Audit 30 May 2011

1.1

Mandate

State Authorised Public Accountant Tom Rasmussen of KPMG AS (KPMG) has been appointed auditor to the Ability Drilling ASA's estate in liquidation, in accordance with the ruling of Nordhordland District Court of 29 June 2009. The estate auditor's tasks are limited by the general mandate provided for in Section 90 of the Bankruptcy Act.

By agreement with the liquidator and in accordance with the court order, the audit of the estate was not initiated immediately, but postponed pending completion of the debtor's accounts up until the date of commencing the winding-up proceedings. This work was essentially completed in the course of the autumn of 2009.

1.2

Scope of the audit

For now, the audit addresses the debtor's activities, particularly its activities during the period leading up to the creditors' petition for liquidation, the petition for voluntary liquidation and the liquidation order.

Most of the work has to do with the securing of accounting data, examination of liquidity development, analysis of accounts and examination of reporting to the financial market. We have also examined minutes of board meetings in relation to financial reporting. We have furthermore assessed matters relating to the bond issue and the repurchase of parts of this debt. How the company's operations and liquidity have developed. Control of the company's other reporting duties, including to public bodies.

A detailed and time-consuming review of disbursements during the period prior to the commencement of winding-up proceedings has been carried out with a view to considering any voidable transactions or

1.3

The auditing process

By agreement with the liquidator, the work of examining the debtor's accounts and business activities was commenced in the course of January 2010.

The tasks of securing of accounting data and examining the company's situation in detail, including the disbursements made before the petition for voluntary liquidation was filed, have been time-consuming. Furthermore, for a long period we have been denied access to the estate's vouchers and systems because of a discussion between the landlord and the estate concerning lease of premises.

During the period reserved for the assignment, we have repeatedly sought the assistance of what used to be the debtor's finance and accounting department, particularly with a view to obtaining their help in reviewing matters relating to the subsidiaries in Malta.

ACCOUNTING, FINANCIAL CONTROL AND AUDITS

3.1 Financial control and reporting
Kennet Tunes, the company's chief financial officer (CFO), had overriding responsibility for the company's financial control and financial reporting. Tunes held this position from autumn 2007 until commencement of the winding-up proceedings.

3.1.1

Reporting to the financial markets
After having conducted an overall review of the company' reporting to the financial market, we find that the company and the company's management have fulfilled their reporting duties. This topic has also been considered by the liquidator. However, reference is made to the comments in section 6.1 of the report.

3.1.2

Chief accountant
The accounts have been kept by the company's own financial department. This function was headed by Lillian Espedal. The company has used recognised programs and suitable tools for the task.

3.1.3 3.2

Accounting
The scope and complexity of the requirements for reporting and keeping of accounts will have increased as Ability Drilling ASA formed an underlying operational organisation in Malta and was listed on Oslo Axess.
The accountant and the rest of the financial department will have been faced with considerable challenges relating to the establishment and organisation of uniform reporting throughout the group. During the period subsequent to the establishment of the organisation in Malta, the accounts were apparently kept by the financial department in Norway. After the closing of the accounts for 2007, this task was apparently transferred to Malta. The reporting procedures between Malta and Norway seem to have been chiefly manual, and following them up will have been time-consuming. However, there is nothing to suggest that the quality of the reporting and follow-up suffered significantly as a result, and the written communication is characterised by a good overview being kept by the financial department.
Auditor
The debtor's auditor was State Authorised Public Accountant Hallvard Aare of PricewaterhouseCoopers AS. PricewaterhouseCoopers AS has been the company's
7

Translation from Norwegian

auditor throughout the period of operation, Correspondingly, the subsidiaries in Malta were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers in Malta.

3.2.1

The auditor's conclusions
Auditor's reports have been issued for the debtor's annual accounts for the 2006, 2007 and 2008 financial years. We have not noted anything in particular concerning the performance of the auditor's tasks.
The auditor has issued auditor's reports for the 2006, 2007 and 2008 financial years. The auditor has not made any reservations or specifications in the auditor's reports for the 2006 or 2007 financial years. In the auditor's report for the 2008 annual accounts the following was specified or subject to reservations for the period of operation:

- Specification that there was material uncertainty as to whether this was a going concern
- Specification that the annual accounts for 2008 were published after the deadline provided for by the Securities Trading Act Section 5-5
- Specification that the Norwegian Tax Payment Act's provisions on the treatment of tax withholdings had not been complied with.

3.3

Minutes of board meetings

Minutes of the board's discussions have been reviewed for most of the period of operation from start-up until the commencement of winding-up proceedings. Board meetings have been held regularly and as required throughout the period of operation. Relevant matters have been submitted to the board in what appears to be a correct and timely manner. We have not noted any special or censurable matters other than the individual matters discussed below, see 6.1

DISBURSEMENTS TO THE BOARD AND GENERAL MANAGER

4.1

Board of Directors

Directors' fees were specified in the annual accounts for 2008. A check against the company's accounting did not reveal any discrepancies. According to the company's accounting, no director's fees were charged to income in 2009. In connection with the review, no other remuneration of the company's directors was noted.

In reviewing the company's bookkeeping for 2008 and 2009, no material transactions with closely related companies were noted except as stated in the company's annual accounts for 2008, and those that follow from the current business mentioned there. For 2007, a payment of NOIC 16.75 million was made to Lonavegen Partners AS in connection with the transfer of rights to contract new drilling rigs from Sense. The matter was correctly dealt with in the annual accounts for 2007 in connection with information about transactions with closely related parties.

Seen in retrospect, at least, it can be questioned whether the transfer of the rights and agreements concerning the relationships with Sense EDM from Lonavegen Partners AS to Ability Drilling ASA, represented values in the order indicated by the amount of the consideration. The same applies to the agreements that were previously replaced by this agreement.

4.2

General Manager Hans Petter Eikeland

Hans Petter Eikeland received a payment of NOK 230,285 on 20 May 2009. Reference is made to the liquidation committee's preliminary report to the District Court in which this matter is described and discussed.

5.4

Liquidity development

During its period of operation, the company (including underlying companies) has not had any significant income from ordinary operations. This means that the company has incurred a loss and a negative cash flow during the material part of this period. This can be illustrated by a simple time line showing the development of the debtor's liquidity:

Total Bank deposits

The figure illustrates the debtor's liquidity development through 2008 until and until the winding-up proceedings commenced in 2009. It shows a persistently serious liquidity situation from November 2008. When this is compared with the intra-group balances, we get a corresponding illustration of how the liquidity was spent:

The figure shows that the debtor's liquidity was spent on the activities of the subsidiaries, with the procurement of operating assets and establishment of operations in accordance with the explicit business plan. When the debtor's liquidity is used to cover expenses and is finally completely spent on continuing the activities in the subsidiaries, this is a sign, among other things, that the subsidiaries do not have sufficient earnings to meet their own liquidity requirements.
It is also interesting to look at the development of trade creditors incurred before the commencement of the winding-up proceedings:

Translation from Norwegian

The figure illustrates the development in trade creditors incurred by the debtor before the winding-up proceedings were commenced. It shows a marked increase in trade creditors in step with the company's diminishing liquidity.

5.5.3

Bond loan
In mid-February 2007, the company issued bonds for NOK 450,000,000. The loan was set up as an integral part of the company's business plan. This financing agreement was entered into following a decision in a board meeting on 25 January 2007. According to the minutes of the board meeting, the agreement was signed because the company had not succeeded in procuring satisfactory financing solutions with ordinary credit institutions.

118 000 000

In addition to the above-mentioned transactions, the company had also made some minor repurchases before those dates.
These purchases had a material impact on the company's liquidity, and we consider that information about these transactions must be deemed to be important to the shareholders of the company. The [purchases took place between mid-November and the beginning of December and the stock exchange was notified at 10:16 on 6 January 2009. We have no information about why it took so long from the transactions were carried out before the announcement was sent to Oslo Børs. We have been informed that tire liquidator/ liquidation committee have considered this matter.
The formal grounds for repurchasing the bonds seems to be a board decision of 18 November 2008, whereby the company's board, following a report from the administration, decided to repurchase bonds that had been issued within the limits set by the available liquidity. On the basis of the time aspect relating to the repurchase, the following is cited from the documents for the board meeting of 18 November 2008
`Reference is made to the b o a rd meeting by conference c a ll on Thursday 6 November, in which repurchase o f bonds was mentioned as a very favourable placem ent o f available liquidity, both because o f the low prices and because our current cashflo w w ill be considerably affected by a reduction in our debt.
The p ic tu re is perceived in the same w a y by shareholders, fa c ilita to rs an d the adm inistration alike. The credit m arket is experiencing a downturn that seems to have no end, a n d this has fo rc e d a number o f players to sell without there being buyers on the opposite side o f the table.
This has led to an almost unprecedented drop in prices. We are working with several specific bond holdings, Up till now, we have secured the repurchase o f a

Translation from Norwegian
The estate in liuidation o fAbility Drilling Estate Auditor's Report Audit 30 May 2011
holding o f N O K 2 1 m illion a t a p ric e o f 44.5% , This leaves us with a gain o f N O K 15 m illion on this holding a lo n e .'
In defining available liquidity, the sale of two 150T rigs was reckoned with. In our view, it is questionable whether this represented a satisfactory decision-maldng basis, since repurchase of bonds had already started at the time when the decision was made and since it should have been understood that the sale of these rigs would obviously not take place until after the on-going repurchasing of debt transactions. Likewise, it should at the time have been perceived as highly probable that if the company did not succeed in selling the rigs, it would immediately be faced with a very serious liquidity challenge. In retrospect, it turned out that the company did not succeed in its attempts to sell these rigs.
In interviews with the estate auditor, Mr Tunes has stated that the calculations and assumptions behind the liquidity forecasts on which the decisions were based were characterised by considerable uncertainty. Furthermore, adequate sensitivity analyses had not been carried out to illustrate the effect of any breach of the assumptions.
It is evident from the board documents that the decision to repurchase debt, and the calculations relating to available liquidity, were to a considerable extent based on the sale of the rigs being effected and the assumed continuation of on-going assignments. We also consider that an analysis should have been prepared of the consequences of any breach of these assumptions. Based on the documentation, we cannot find any evidence of such a consequence analyses having taken place. Nor is it evident that the board analysed any risks in this connection. These assumptions were essential for the administration's liquidity analysis. This is further underlined by the liquidity situation being described as very strained as from the first board meeting following the decision.

6.2

Loans to employees

According to the reported accounts of May 2009, the company had an outstanding claim of NOK 750.000 against Kjetil Abbedisen for which a loan agreement had been signed. The loan was granted on 15 October 2008 and, according to the loan agreement, NOK 500,000 was to be repaid on 15 October 2009. The remaining amount of NOK 250,000 would fall due for payment on the last day of employment in the event that the debtor/employee were to resign four years after the date of disbursement of the loan. In addition to the above, interest was to be paid at the applicable norm rate for employment relationships of the outstanding amount that had not yet fallen due at any time. We have been informed that the estate has followed up the agreement with the employee in question and that an agreement has been entered into.

6.3

Pre-paid insurance

According to the reported accounts of May 2009, insurance pre-payments by the company amount to NOK 394,678. We request that the liquidation committee approach the company's insurance contacts to inquire whether the estate can claim repayment of this amount, either in whole or in part.

Value added tax

6.4.1 Value added tax, Ability Drilling ASA

Information received from a whistle-blower
In November 2008, the Board of Directors of Ability Drilling ASA received information from the company's elected auditor that came from a previous employee of the company to the effect that the company was involved in financial irregularities in connection with a business relationship with KAN International Petroleum Services. The latter company was an agent hired by Ability Drilling in connection with assignments carried out in Jordan. In this connection, the auditor initiated an investigation into the alleged irregularities, which was carried out by the company's investigation entity. The investigation did not uncover any financial irregularities between Ability Drilling ASA and KAN International Petroleum Services.
After reviewing a report from PWC and in consultation with the liquidator, we have decided not to pursue this matter further.

The company has opened a separate bank account for tax withholdings. The balance of the account was NOK 1,100,365.30 on 30 January 2009. The balance had not changed as of 30 April 2009. Two transfers of NOK 45,000 and NOK 131,460, respectively, were made on 25 and 27 May 2009. The balance on 27 May 2009 was NOK 1,276,825.30.

2009. This means that it was only for the third period that money was transferred from the tax withholdings account to the municipal treasurer.

A payment of NOK 2,594,441 for the first payroll tax instalment period was made on 18 March 2009 and charged to the current account. A corresponding payment of NOK 2,354,740 for the second period of 2009 was charged to the current account on 15 May 2009. In addition to this, a payment of NOK 686,211 was made on 16 April 2009, comprising additional tax withholdings for 2008. The amount was charged to the current account.

The transfers can be summed up as follows:

Shortfall, tax withholding account 1,494,076 1,254,375

The amount from 2008 concerns additional tax withholdings relating to additional reporting for 2008.

As mentioned above, the company had a separate bank account for tax withholdings. However, it has not been used as required by the Tax Payment Act Section 5-12, in that sufficient funds have not been transferred to the bank account for tax withholdings. This means that for the first and second periods in 2009, there was a shortfall in the transferred amounts of NOK 1,494,076 and NOK 1,254,375, respectively. (Concerning breach of Section 5-12 of the tax Payment Act, see section 11.1.1 below.)

Concerning the company's direct payments of tax withholdings from the current account in 2009, we request that the liquidation committee consider whether there is a basis for reversing the payments in part of in full pursuant to the Satisfaction of Claims Act Section 5-5, as the payments were made during the final three months before the filing date and some of the payments were made after the due date.

We request that the liquidation committee consider the extent to which there may be a basis for filing a claim against the company's board, since tax withholdings have not been treated in accordance with the Tax Payment Act Section 5-12.

7.11 Employer's National Insurance contributions

REASON FOR LIQUIDATION

The reasons why winding-up proceedings were commenced are complex, but the most important factors appear to be:

o Delays relating to the delivery of drilling rigs and performance of the contracts with TTS Sense

* Problems relating to the performance of signed assignment agreements as a consequence of rig and equipment deficiencies

« Repurchase of bonds below par

· A downturn in the markets for the company's activities, including falling rates for drilling assignments and a related decline in the market value of the company's material assets.

8.1

Delays and deficiencies relating to the delivery of completed drilling rigs

Throughout the company's period of operation, there have been considerable problems associated with the delivery of rigs built by TTS Sense AS for Ability Drilling ASA. The relationship between the parties appears to have been particularly marked by conflict and lack of clarity. Considerable delays and deficiencies relating to quality and documentation have diminished Ability Drilling ASA's possibility of mobilising the rigs by the date agreed with the client. This has caused Ability Drilling ASA to incur considerable costs and loss of income. Reference is also made to the liquidator's report concerning the relationship with TTS Sense AS.

8.2

Execution of agreed assignments

From start-up of the first drilling assignment, Ability Drilling ASA experienced considerable operational disruptions. This was partly due to the fact that the rigs proved less suitable for assignments under the climate and environmental conditions in which they were used, and partly because the operating equipment did not work as intended. During the execution of drilling assignments, the rigs proved to have quality deficiencies relating to operations, including operations under desert conditions, which had not been foreseen on delivery. As a result, considerable extra expenses were incurred after mobilisation, as well as loss of income from completion o f the assignment. Nor was the company able to deliver drilling assignments of the expected quality as the project progressed.

It appears from the review that the company succeeded neither in ensuring employment for its rigs nor in subsequently selling the rigs. It is reasonable to assume that this had to do with the rigs' aforementioned deficiencies.

8.3

Repurchase of bonds

At the same time as the board and management of Ability Drilling ASA concluded that the income-generating activities did not progress in accordance with plans and assumptions, they also perceived an opportunity to repurchase some of the company's bonds at a reduced price. This was apparently seen as an opportunity to downscale the company's risk exposure and expenses. Liquidity forecasts were prepared on the basis of reduced activity and the assumed sale of some of the company's operating assets. According to the documentation that was sent to the board, these forecasts showed that the company had the liquidity needed to repurchase some of its debt. The management defined some prerequisites for its decision, including that some rigs were to be sold to boost the company's liquidity. However, the company did not succeed in obtaining new liquidity at the same time as it was repurchasing its debt. Though this can hardly be said to have reduced the company's capital, it is clear that the company's liquidity situation was materially worsened as a consequence of this decision, as was the company's ability to pursue its claim against TTS Sense AS.

8.4

Market situation

There was a marked downturn in the markets for the company's activities during the period fr o m October 2008 until the commencement of the winding-up proceedings. In a situation where the group is trying to sell operating equipment and experiences difficulties relating to the timely and technical performance of assignments for customers, this had immediate adverse consequences for the company's operations and financial status.

In our opinion, the company placed itself in a very difficult liquidity situation when it repurchased debt without an infusion of new liquidity from the sale of some of the company's operating equipment. In our view, the liquidator must consider whether the above-mentioned circumstances constitute a wrongful act involving liability in damages on the part of the company's board.

TIME OF BECOMING INSOLVENT

An excess of liabilities over assets and an inability to meet liabilities as they fall due are cumulative conditions for insolvency. The inability to meet liabilities as they fall due must not be of a temporary nature. When the conditions are fulfilled, a company is normally insolvent. However, the decisive condition is that liabilities exceed the sum total o f assets and expected net income,

During its period of operation, Ability Drilling ASA had considerable problems relating to the delivery of contracted drilling platforms for onshore drilling assignments, both with respect to delivery times and the expected quality of the deliveries. This activity constituted the company's only potential source of income, with the result that the company's budgets were not fulfilled as intended. Nor was the expected rate of employment achieved for the rigs that were put into operation. This has been identified as a problem relating to the quality of and area of use of the equipment. These factors have all been well documented, both prior to and following the commencement of the winding-up proceedings.

9.1

Excess of liabilities over assets

The assessment of the time at which liabilities exceed assets is a static assessment. This is the case when the company's liabilities exceed the value of its assets.

In the case of Ability Drilling ASA, the date on which the company's liabilities exceeded its assets cannot be determined with any great certainty.

Based on our review of market presentations, stock exchange announcements, financial reporting and minutes of board meetings, we note that the company was faced with major challenges from the summer of 2008 relating to the mobilisation, execution and realisation of signed agreements, whether on-going assignments or letters of intent. In our opinion, disputes concerning the building contracts with TTS Sense AS were decisive for this situation. Normally, Ability Drilling ASA should be able to assume that the cancellation cases would in fact entitle to a refund of prepayments made during the building period. The refund would be based on an assessment of the cost price of the company's assets (the rigs) and contractual commitments between the parties.

As of the date of adoption of the financial statements for 2008, the company had written down its operating equipment at group level by NOIC 385 million. The basis for the valuation at that time was expected realisable values. These values would be based on the company being able to realise the assets in a situation of almost ordinary activities. There is reason to assume that as the level of conflict increased and the trust deteriorated between TTS Sense AS and Ability Drilling ASA during the period from February 2009, the possibility of selling was not realistic, since it was not in fact

Translation from Norwegian
The estate in /initiation o fAbility Drilling Estate Auditor's Report Audit 30 May 2011
possible for Ability Drilling ASA to realise the group's assets without TTS Sense AS's cooperation.
It is reasonable to assume that the company's liabilities were in excess of its assets during this period. However, there is uncertainty attached to this assessment, since Ability Drilling ASA believed that it had considerable claims for restitution against TTS Sense AS as a consequence of the cancellation cases. On this basis it can be argued that the liquidity problem is decisive for considering liabilities to be in excess of assets, inasmuch as the company did not have the financial means to bring the case before the case before a court.

9.2

Inability to meet liabilities as they fall due

The assessment of inability to meet liabilities as they fall due is a dynamic assessment and the situation exists when this is in fact the case. In relation to insolvency, it is a condition that the inability to meet one's liabilities as they fall due is not of a purely temporary nature.

The company's liquidity situation seems to have been satisfactory up until the period of major repurchasing of debt. The company had been financed with a view to a prolonged construction and start-up period; however, the originally defined time schedule on which the need for finance was based was clearly not realistic at that point in time.

In November 2008 the company's management prepared supporting documents for a decision on the repurchase of some of the debt. This was based on a complex solution made up of several measures, including the sale of rigs.

From the minutes of the board meeting of 18 November 2008:

5 Repurchase o f debt (bonds) The administration, represented by the CFO, gave an account o f the circumstances surrounding the repurchase o f debt. I t was emphasised that, based on the planned activity, the company's liquidity would allow f o r this and that, with reference to a subsequent agenda item, the selling o f rigs w ill provide us with liquid reserves with a view to repurchasing debt. I t was also emphasised thatfuture cashflow s w ill be considerably improved through a reduction o f the company's debt, and that this w ill have a positive effect on the company's equity-to-asset ratio. A t present, the administration considers repurchase o f the company's debt to be one o f the best available investment options. On the basis o f the information that was presented, the board adopted thefollow ing decision:

The company can buy back as much as possible o f its debt, within sound liquidity limits.

Translation from Norwegian
The estate in liuhlatlon o fAbility Drilling Estate Auditor's Report Audit 30 May 2011
A fter ike board meeting, bonds with a nominal value o f N O K 118 m illion w ere repurchased. T he consideration paid for these shares was NO K 55.7 m illion. The assumptions on which this decision w as based were never successfully fulfilled, in addition to w hich operations developed at a slow er rate than that w hich had been considered in the decision-m aking basis with which the board w as presented. It can be questioned whether CFO T u nes's presentation to the board w as based on realistic assumptions.

From the minutes o f the board meeting o f 12 February 2009:

In form ation w a v also p rovided about the assessments relatin g to the repurchase o f debt. The board acknowledged that the assessments should have taken more account o f uncertainty and that the com pany's b oard an d management as a whole h a d underestimated the loss o f contracts an d the resultant inadequate cashflo w .

It is questionable whether the board had formed a realistic view o f income opportunities and the liquidity situation. On behalf o f the liquidation com m ittee, the liquidator is requested to consider whether the board m ay be liable in damages follow in g this disruption and, if so, to what extent.

W e consider that this decision had a significant impact on A bility Drilling A S A 's liquidity situation and ability to safeguard its interests in relation to TTS Sense A S.

T he com pany notified the market and its surroundings in general o f the universal temporary suspension o f paym ents as from 13 M ay 2 0 10 for the purpose o f ensuring equal treatment o f creditors. A t that time, several tracks were being follow ing in an effort to secure funding for continued operation. W hen the effort failed, the com pany w as unable to m eet its liabilities as they fell due.

9.3

Conclusion regarding insolvency

In our v ie w , the com pany becam e insolvent at the tim e w hen the relationship and negotiations with TTS Sense A S were terminated. On the basis o f available documentation o f this process, the tim e can be set to the date on which TTS Sense A S submitted the creditors' petition. A t that tim e, A b ility D rillin g A S A w as defacto incapable o f safeguarding its interests in relation to TTS Sense A S. A t the same time, the company lacked sufficient sales support to safeguard values in connection with a realisation o f assets. In such a situation, the company is deemed to have had liabilities in excess if its assets, to have been incapable o f m eeting its liabilities as they fell due and to have been without any realistic possibility o f rem edying the situation through increasing its incom e or adding new income.

10 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS / POSSIBLE CRIMINAL AND/OR WRONGFUL ACTS INVOLVING LIABILITY IN DAMAGES
10.1 Compliance with laws and regulations Based on our review, we request the liquidator to consider the following:

10.1.1

The Tax Payment Act
The company has not used its bank account for tax withholdings as prescribed by law, in that neither have tax withholdings to a sufficient extent been transferred to the bank account for tax withholdings nor has it complied with the applicable laws relating to deducted tax withholdings. This constitutes a breach of the Tax Payment Act Section 512,

10.2 Directors' liability
It is uncertain whether the board in connection with the repurchase of debt had obtained an adequate decision-making basis and carried out sufficient and necessary analyses of the company's business situation prior to adopting the decision. Furthermore, at the time when the decision was made, repurchases of a not inconsiderable volume had been made without the board's decision. The board's decision in this case had considerable and direct effect on the company's liquidity situation in spring 2009. The liquidator is requested to consider whether, based on the facts of the case, any wrongful acts have been committed that involve liability in damages.
In addition to the above, tax withholdings for 2008 were paid on 16 April 2009 in connection with additional reporting of benefits liable to tax withholdings. The liquidator is requested to consider whether, based on the facts of the case, any wrongful acts have been committed that involve liability in damages.
