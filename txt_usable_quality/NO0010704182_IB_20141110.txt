To the bondholders in: ISIN: NO 0010704182 -12 per cent Norshore Atlantic B.V. Callable Bond Issue 2014/2018
Oslo, 10 November 2014
Corrected typing error in the Bond Agreement
Nordic Trustee ASA acts as the Bond Trustee for the above mentioned Bond Issue where Norshore Atlantic B.V. is the Issuer. Capitalised terms herein shall have the meaning as assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 20 February 2014 (the "Bond Agreement"). Due to a typing error in Clause 16.4 in the Bond Agreement, a reference is here made to "the prices set out in Clause 10.3." Clause 10.3 is the Call Option provision, which does not allow for any prepayment during the first three years of the Bond Agreement. The Mandatory Prepayment amounts are regulated in Clause 10.5 of the Bond Agreement, which sets out a prepayment premium for the first three years and thereafter ties the prepayment amounts back to the Call Option premiums in Clause 10.3. It is clear from the provisions of the term sheet that the reference set out in Clause 16.4 should have been made to the Mandatory Prepayment amount in Clause 10.5 instead of Clause 10.3. Accordingly, please note that we will amend Clause 16.4 in the Bond Agreement to read "the prices set out in Clause 10.5" and publish an updated Bond Agreement on Stamdata.
Yours sincerely, Nordic Trustee ASA
Vivian Trøsch
