All capitalized terms used herein shall, except as otherwise defined herein or required by the context, have the meanings assigned thereto in the Loan Agreement.

According to the Loan Agreement, an interest payment was due on 4 M ay 2010. Accordingly, unless the Borrowers have paid the interest before the expiry o f the 5 Banking Day grace period (the "Grace Period"), there will be an E vent o f D efault under Clause 15.1(a) the L oan Agreem ent.

In order to allow discussions with Bondholders to take place, and to maintain stability at the Company, we would be prepared to grant an extension to the Grace Period. Certain bondholders have presented a restructuring proposal to Cecon and are pursuing discussions with Cecon in order to find a solution to its liquidity issues

W e therefore confirm that, the Grace Period shall be extended to expire on 27 A ugust 2010, or to any date before that if the Loan Trustee give a 2 Banking D ays' written notice o f the expiry o f the Grace Period.

All our rights and the rights o f the Bondholders in respect o f the Bonds and the Loan Agreement are hereby reserved, the Grace Period and any other breaches or defaults which m ay have arisen under the Bonds.
