Results from written procedure Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) is the appointed agent under the terms and conditions in the abovementioned bond issues (the "Terms and Conditions"). Terms defined in the Terms and Conditions shall have the same meaning when used in this notice, unless otherwise defined herein.

The voting period expired on 20 November 2017. A sufficient number of votes was obtained in order to form a quorum and a requisite majority of the voting Bondholders voted in favour of (i) approving a restructuring of the Group's debt liabilities, (ii) amending the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds in order for the Bondholders to exchange approximately 41 per cent. of their existing senior claims under the Bonds for participating notes passing on the benefit of 22,093,580 ordinary shares and junior ZAR-denominated payment-in-kind notes to be issued by the Company, (iii) releasing Real People Kenya Ltd as a guarantor for the Bonds, and (iv) extending the final date of the standstill period under the standstill agreement with its senior creditors from 30 November 2017 to 22 December 2017. The implementation and the effectiveness of the amendments to the Terms and Conditions are subject to conditions set out in the Notice.
