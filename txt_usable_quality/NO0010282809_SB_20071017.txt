ISIN: NO 001 028280.9 -9.00 per cent Songa Offshore ASA Bond Issue 2005/2010

Oslo, 17 October 2007

REQUEST FOR CONSENT TO EARLY REDEMPTION - Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") is appointed as Loan Trustee for the above mentioned Bond issue (the "Loan") where Songa Offshore ASA (the "Company") is the Borrower.

All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Loan Agreement unless otherwise stated.

The Company proposes an early redemption of the entire Loan on 5 November 2007 at a price of 109.00% of par plus accrued unpaid interest. The price corresponds to an asset swap spread of 63 basis points on 17 October 2007. The new Maturity Date is suggested to be 5 November 2007.

The background for the proposed early redemption, is the need in the Company's view to finalise the restructuring of its balance sheet, which took place during May-June 2007. The Company then entered into a new USD 650 million facility with a group of banks. The facility has been drawn to USD 587.6 million. Further the Company has already cancelled out USD 47.6 million par value of the Loan. The early redemption will be partly financed through a final draw down of the remaining undrawn part of the facility.

Investors should note, that if the proposal is not approved, the banks have accepted to refinance a smaller amount, and the Company intends to leave the 2010 9% bond outstanding. If the proposal is not approved, the bond will mature as initially intended at 100% in 2010.

Questions may be directed to Mr. Tom E. Jebsen, CFO, at +47 2301 1431 (w) / 90 747 997
(m ).

To enable the Borrower to conduct the proposed change of the Loan Agreement, the Borrower has requested the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to consider the approval of the proposed changes.

The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.
