CorpNordic Sweden AB (the " A gent") acting in its capacity as Agent for the Noteholders under the Terms and Conditions, hereby initiates a Written Procedure whereby the Noteholders can approve or reject the below request made by the Issuer. The request is described in section A. (Request) below. Noteholders participate by completing and sending the voting form attached below to the Agent.

Votes received thereafter may be disregarded. To be eligible to participate in the Written Procedure a person must fulfill the formal criteria for being a Noteholder on 23 January 2014 (the "Record Date"). This means that the person must be registered on a Securities Account with Euroclear Sweden as a direct registered owner (direktregistreradägare) or authorised nominee (förvaltare) with respect to one or several Notes.

A. Request

Backgr ound

In connection with the year-end report 2012/2013, the Issuer announced that it is exploring the possibilities to strengthen its capital base by potentially issuing preference shares. Following the implementation of new accounting rules relating to pensions (IAS 19, Employee Benefits) and certain related measures, the Issuer estimates a reduction of the Group's shareholders' equity by approximately SEK 7 billion. An issue of preference shares - which would be accounted for as shareholders' equity and hence, will rank behind the Notes - would result in:

·

a reduced net leverage ratio;

·

a strengthened equity ratio; and

·

an improved financial preparedness of the Group to address upcoming

debt maturities and the modernisation of the aircraft fleet.

On 16 January 2014, the Board of Directors of the Issuer announced its proposal to the Issuer's annual general meeting, to be held on 18 February 2014, to decide on amendments to the articles of association of the Issuer and to authorise the Board of Directors of the Issuer to decide on issuing preference shares. The issue of such preference shares is contingent on an amendment to the dividend restrictions in the Terms and Conditions in order to make an exception for preference shares alone. Hence, the Issuer has requested that the Agent initiates a Written Procedure in order for the Noteholders to approve the request described below.

Noteholders owning Notes in an aggregated Nominal Amount of SEK 375 million, representing 25 per cent. of the total outstanding Nominal Amount of the Notes have announced that they are in favour of the below request. The threshold for quorum at the Written Procedure is 20 per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount.

For further information regarding the proposal to authorise the Board of Directors of the Issuer to decide on issuing preference shares please see the press release of the Issuer on 16 January 2014.

Request

The Issuer requests that the Noteholders decide to approve that the following new Clause 11.2(c) be included in the Terms and Conditions.

11.2 (a)

Distributions
The Issuer shall not:
(i) declare, make or pay any dividend or any other distribution in cash or in kind on or in respect of its share capital other than dividends or distributions (a) made in respect of any employee share purchase or share option scheme or (b) requested by a minority of shareholders in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act (aktiebolagslagen (2005:551]);
(ii) repurchase any of its own shares other than in connection with any employee share purchase or share option scheme; or

(iii) redeem its share capital or other restricted equity with repayment to its shareholders.

CorpNordic

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the Issuer may make such transfer of value to its shareholders in an aggregate amount in any financial year (including the transfer of value in question) not exceeding fifty (50) per cent. of the Group's consolidated net profit for the previous financial year, if at the time of the proposal or recommendation from the board of directors of the Issuer to resolve upon such transfer of value:
(i) no Event of Default is continuing; and
(ii) the ratio of Equity to Total Assets pursuant to the most recently published financial statements of the Group is at least 35 per cent. (tested pro forma and calculated as if the transfer of value in question had already occurred).
(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b), provided that no Event o fDefault is outstanding, the Issuer may always pay dividends in respect o fpreference shares (preferensaktier) issued by it. The amount o f dividends paid in respect o fpreference shares in any financialyear shall reduce the amount that may be distributedpursuant to paragraph (b) in such same financialyear with an equal amount.
The amendment of the Terms and Conditions in accordance with the request above shall have immediate effect from (and including) the date that the decision to approve the request is adopted.

B. Decision procedure
The Agent will determine if received replies are eligible to participate and calculate the result.
When a requisite majority of consents of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount have been received by the Agent the relevant decision shall be deemed to be adopted, even if the time period for replies in the Written Procedure has not yet expired.
Information about the decision taken in the Written Procedure will be sent by notice to the Noteholders, be published as a press release and published on the websites of the Group and the Agent.
The minutes from the Written Procedure shall at the request of a Noteholder be sent to it by the Issuer or the Agent, as applicable.
A matter decided will be binding for all Noteholders, irrespective of them responding in the Written Procedure.

Voting rights
Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on 23 January 2014 (the " Record D ate"):

(i)

be registered on the Securities Account as a direct registered owner

( d irektreg istrerad ägare); o r

(ii) be registered on the Securities Account as authorised nominee (fö rv a lta re ),

with respect to one or several Notes.

CorpNordic
If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Notes are held through a registered authorised nominee (förvaltare) or another intermediary, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the Notes.
1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Notes on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.
2. You can obtain a power of attorney or other authorisation from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own voting form based on the authorisation. If you hold your Notes through several intermediaries, you need to obtain authorisation directly from the intermediary that is registered in the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of holders, starting with the intermediary that is registered in the Securities Account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.
Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Notes on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).
The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Notes on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Notes are registered or need authorisation or other assistance to participate.
Notes owned by the Issuer, another Group Company or an Affiliate do not entitle to any voting rights.
Quorum Quorum only exists if Noteholders representing twenty (20) per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount reply to the request in the Written Procedure. If a quorum does not exist, the Agent or the Issuer shall initiate a second Written Procedure, provided that the relevant proposal has not been withdrawn by the person(s) who initiated the Written Procedure. No quorum requirement will apply to such second Written Procedure. Voting forms provided before 17.00 CET on 6 February 2014 in respect o f the Written Procedure shall also remain valid for any such second Written Procedure.
M ajority More than 50 per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Noteholders reply in the Written Procedure must consent to the Issuer's request in order for it to be approved.
