AMENDMENT REQUEST LETTER Scan Bidco A/S (the "Issuer") Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) (acting on behalf of the Bondholders)

28 July 2016
RE: Terms and Conditions for the up to USD 250,000,000 Senior Secured Callable Bonds (ISIN Tranche 1: NO0010768062 and Tranche 2: N00010768070), dated 27 June 2016, issued by Scan Bidco A/S (the "Terms and Conditions").
Capitalized terms used herein shall unless otherwise indicated have the meaning given to them in the Terms and Conditions.
1. BACKGROUND
The structure of the Acquisition has been slightly amended due to amongst others that the new structure is considered to be more advantageous for the sellers, including from a Danish tax perspective. Following completion of the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement the Issuer will still hold 100 % of the shares in the Target (the "Target Shares") through direct and indirect ownership. The ownership will be structured as follows: The Issuer will own (i) 100 % of the shares in Anpartsselskabet af 1. November 2006 which owns approximately 46 % of the Target Shares through its wholly owned subsidiary Nidovni HH A/S, (ii) 100 % of the shares in TTGR Holding ApS which owns approximately 20 % of the Target Shares and (iii) all the remaining Target Shares (approximately 34 %). The new structure will not negatively affect the Issuers ability to make payments pursuant to the Terms and Conditions. Due to the new structure, in order for the Bondholders to receive security over all Target Shares and the holding companies between the Issuer and the Target, the Terms and Conditions have to be adjusted in order to reflect that certain additional security documents will be entered into. Such amendment should not be detrimental to the interest of the Bondholders.
2. AMENDMENTS TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
In our capacity as Issuer of the Bonds under the Terms and Conditions and on the basis of Clause 19(a)(i) of the Terms and Conditions, we hereby request that the current definition of "Security Documents" is amended to read as follows:
"Security Documents" means the following security documents pursuant to which the Transaction Security is created:
(a) a pledge agreement entered into by the Issuer, Nidovni HH A/S, TTGR Holding ApS and the Agent in respect of all the shares currently issued in the Target;

(b) a pledge agreement entered into by the Issuer and the Agent in respect of all the shares currently issued in Anpartsselskabet af 1. November 2006;
(c) a pledge agreement entered into by the Issuer and the Agent in respect of all the shares currently issued in TTGR Holding ApS;
(d) a pledge agreement entered into by Anpartsselskabet af 1. November 2006 and the Agent in respect of all the shares currently issued in Nidovni HH A/S;
(e) a pledge agreement entered into by the Issuer and the Agent in respect of an USD denominated intra-Group loan between the Issuer and the Target in the amount on-lent to Target for purposes of repaying the Refinancing Debt;
(f) a pledge agreement entered into by the Target and the Agent in respect of all the shares from time to time issued in Scan Global Logistics A/S (however only securing an amount up to the proceeds from the issuance of Bonds used to refinance the Refinancing Debt);
(g) a pledge agreement entered into by the Target and the Agent in respect of the intra-Group loan between the Target and Scan Global Logistics A/S in the approximate amount of DKK 80,000,000 (however only securing an amount up to the proceeds from the issuance of Bonds used to refinance the Refinancing Debt);
(h) any security document pursuant to which additional security is provided in accordance with Clause 10(c); and
(i) any other document designated as a Security Document by the Issuer and the Agent.
Except as otherwise provided in this letter, the Terms and Conditions shall remain unchanged in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
