1 BACKGROUND
1.1 Introduction
On 19 May 2015, the Issuer and the Bond Trustee entered into an agreement under which certain resolutions agreed at the Bondholders' Meeting held on 19 May 2015 were adopted in respect of the Bond Agreement (the "Amendment Agreement No. 1"), and on 3 June 2015, the Issuer and the Bond Trustee entered into a further agreement under which certain resolutions agreed at the Bondholders' Meeting held on 3 June 2015 were adopted in respect of the Bond Agreement (the "Amendment Agreement No. 2"). On 4 September 2015, the Issuer and the Bond Trustee entered into a further agreement under which certain resolutions agreed at the Bondholders' Meeting held on 31 August 2015 were adopted in respect of the Bond Agreement ("Amendment and Restatement No. 1").
The Issuer, together with Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro, S.A.P.I. de C.V. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"), has been involved in discussions with an ad hoc committee of Bondholders (the "2015 Ad Hoc Bondholder Committee") whose members are Clearwater Capital Partners Hong Kong Limited, Centerbridge Partners, L.P., Greylock Capital Management, LLC, and Taconic Capital Advisors L.P., and with an ad hoc committee (the "2019 Ad Hoc Bondholder Committee") of holders (the "2019 Bondholders") of the USD 725,000,000 7.50% Senior Secured Bond Issue 2014/2019 (the "2019 Bonds" or "2019 Bond Issue") of Oro Negro Drilling Pte.

The Issuer and the 2015 Ad Hoc Bondholder Committee are in the process of negotiating a term sheet, and the current form of the term sheet is attached to this summons as Exhibit 1 (the "Restructuring Plan"). In connection with implementing such plan, the Issuer will require access to funds which are currently being held as part of the Liquidity Account requirement pursuant to Clauses 13.4(c)(ii) and 13.7(a) of the Bond Agreement (the "Liquidity Requirement").

It is anticipated that the forms of definitive agreements implementing the Restructuring Plan shall be finalized prior to the Liquidity Bondholders' Meeting (as defined below) contemplated by this summons and that a summons for a subsequent meeting of Bondholders to be convened to approve such definitive agreements shall be posted prior to or on the date of the Liquidity Bondholders' Meeting.

It is proposed that the Liquidity Bondholders' Meeting resolves the following:

In order to have a quorum, at least 1/2 of the Voting Bonds must be represented at such meeting.
Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Liquidity Bondholders' Meeting.
