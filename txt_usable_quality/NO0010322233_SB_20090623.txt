Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date.

(If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.)
The individual bondholder may authorise Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Norsk Tillitsmann to vote, must then be returned to Norsk Tillitsmann in due time before the Bondholders' meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to Norsk Tillitsmann, to notify Norsk Tillitsmann by telephone or by e-mail (as set out at the first page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.

 Saga Oil ASA has been facing a challenging financial situation since 2Q 2008. The company failed to refinance the NOK 100 million bond, and has subsequently struggled to avoid bankruptcy. The company currently exists at the mercy of its financial creditors
 The value of the company has been written down and presently reflects a more realistic value. However, there are still uncertainties attached to the valuation of the company
 The current Board of Directors was elected in September 2008, and entered negotiations with Norsk Tillitsmann regarding a creditor agreement and a shareholder loan during September - mid December. At that point in time, VAT refund secured the company liquidity, and the shareholder loan was not completed and drawn up, and focus put on restructuring and sale of the company
 In January 2009, the company initiated a sales process, with the aim to either sell assets or the entire company
- Process is still ongoing
 Regardless of the conclusion of the sales process, it is the opinion of the Board of Directors that the only viable route for the company to avoid bankruptcy and to preserve values is to restructure the outstanding debt in Saga Oil ASA and to enter into an agreement with financial creditors to Saga Oil ASA to convert debt to equity
4

Status

 Since election of the new Board of Directors in September 2008, the following main steps have been taken to restructure the company:

 Reservoirs slightly underpressured due to surface elevation appr. 350 m above msl.

 Temperatures varies from 26°C at 1220m to 42°C at 1710m.

 Viscosity varies from 9 cp at 1220 down to 5 cp at 1710m, low GOR's.

 Permeabilities are: Tournasian 14md, Dankovo-Lebedyansky 4 md and Pashiyan +500md.

 Naturallyfractured limestones in the region traditionallyflow well after acidisation, sandstones after small hydraulic propped frac.

 Edge waterdrive likely in most reservoirs, but pumping still required.

 Promgeotek is gradually optimizing the acidisation of the limestone formations, aims to cure massive damage of the sandstone formation with sand jet perforating and is considering to use lateral drilling. Initial results from the acidisation are positive.

Rodnikovsky
East Shaltinsky Field Development Status Summary
 15 newwells drilled, 6 in production (producing 250 bopd perearlyJune 2009), flowlines, separation, storage, metering and truck export systems in place togetherwith a functioning production organisation.
 78 km2 of 3D coverage over field, good well control.  Saga Oil was unable to capture lessons learned by BP et al in the Orenburg region for maximising
well performance; acidising the Tournasian limestones, fracturing the sandstones. This due to a period when they drilled most ofthe wells butwere unable to produce because of bureaucratic challenges. No lessons could thus be learned or techniques/contracts modified.  This, combined with possibly poor cement(?) and probably significant formation damage has resulted in sub economic well rates.  Earlier production forecasts based upon one existing well (that produced some 150 bopd) and high capital costs ultimately led to cash flow problems as similar rates were not subsequently achieved from new wells.  Remaining tasks: improve well / reservoir connectivity by improving acidisation techniques, alternatively lateral drilling / properly designed acid jobs / sand jet perforating of sandstone reservoirs.  Re-evaluate drilling procedures for future wells and complete infill drilling.  Offsetfield wells typically average 160 bopd, with up to 700 bopd after initial completion. Based on 30 wells in the field and well performance in line with typical rates for the region, combined with prudent well completion and stimulation techniques, it is estimated that a field performance of 3 000 bopd on plateau can be achieved for the field.

Existing Facilities at East Shaltinsky
 Field base with offices, kitchen, rest facilities, security, work shops, welding shop, stores, very large covered warehouse (384 m2, 7.2 meters tall) and satellite communication equipment.
 Processing centre at the field base of very high industrial standard and a capacity stated to be 1 600 bopd. Debottlenecking is likely to increase capacity. Produced gas used at the heater treaters or flared. Offloading equipment to road tankers in operation.
 Four pads connected back to the process centre with buried flow lines. Pads 1, 2 and 3 have their own test unit (Sputnik and electronic data loggers) and electrical power from the net.
 Two of the four pads and the process facility has reasonable access by road from the main highway. The remaining two pads are less accessible in adverse weather conditions.
 Oktyobrsky, the main local town is one hour by car from the field. The main office is located there, is well equipped and of western standard.
 Wells continue to be worked over to improve their completions. Produced water is stored on site and disposed off in an injection well batch wise.

 Promgeotek has negotiated two different export routes for their production. Both require trucking to a processing plant for prior to being sold in the domestic pipeline system. Costs for transport / processing are approximately $3.10/bbl. Only one of these has been used so far.
 Once greater production levels are achieved, regular export is possible with a marginally higher product price (estimated at 3-4 $/bbl @ a Urals price of $60/bbl).
 VAT recovery is functioning and Promgeotek has received back some of the money due.
 Upon completion of production, all facilities are to be removed and the surface soils returned for use for farming. The nature of the development will ease this process (i.e. pad drilling).
 Shallower (3-500m) reservoirs reported regionally to contain gas and oil have not yet been explored properly or exploited at East Shaltinsky. This shallow oil is produced elsewhere at rates of 10-50 bopd per well. The formation is quite extensive and has been mapped on seismic and by shallow coring.
