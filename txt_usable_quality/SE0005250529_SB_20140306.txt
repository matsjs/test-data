1 Introduction and Background 1.1 Business update Hornsbergs Strand The JV1-project is sold to 100%, and the last residents moved in during October 2013. Hence, the Mandatory Partial Prepayment becomes applicable with respect to JV1 by 28 September 2014. Occupation with respect to JV2 occurs August 2014 to August 2015. All except one of the 225 apartments are sold. All future proceeds from the joint ventures are expected to amount to SEK 295 million. Index Energy The CAD 75 million equity investment made by Index Energy Mills has been successful and enabled Index Energy Mills to finance the remaining project through local Torontobased banks with a CAD 60 million construction term loan. As the project is now fully financed, redevelopment of the plant is expected to be operational at 90% ofthe power purchase agreement capacity at 5 December 2014 at the latest, increasing output to 95% on 10 March 2015.

Upon completion, the strong cash flows from the operation will be employed to repay indebtedness. 1.2 Extensive project pipeline Stockholm region The Company has, through its Swedish subsidiaries acquired land in Bålsta and Norrtälje for the purpose of constructing several clusters of residential units, including;
· 150 rental apartments, kindergarten and elderly care facilities in Kalmarsand, Bålsta;
· 125 condominiums in Kalmarsand, Bålsta; and · 300 rental apartments on Bryggårdsgärdet, Norrtälje. The Company forecasts a need for total equity investments of SEK 300 million over the period 2014-2017. Florida Index Enterprise LLC has, through its subsidiaries Index Apartments LLC and Index Senior Living Group LLC, several ongoing real estate projects in Florida, including; · Riva, 100 luxury condominiums in Fort Lauderdale; · 6 separate multi-family rental apartment properties totalling 450 apartments
completed or under construction as well as 400 apartments in the development phase in Palm Beach County; and · 3 assisted living facilities totalling 227 residential units in Orlando, Sebastian and Tarpon Springs. The Florida real estate market is growing as the remnants from the financial crisis recede and the Index Enterprise LLC company group is ideally positioned to capture this opportunity. An agreement regarding a USD 500 million co-development partnership has been signed with Watercrest Senior Living Group, a leading US-based senior living operator and developer, to capitalise on the strong demographic trends supporting the assisted living facilities concept. The forecasted need for total equity investments over the period 2014-2017 is SEK 200 million. 1.3 Adjustments of existing bond terms Management projects significant capital requirements to finance the project pipeline, both in Sweden and North America. It is currently evaluating several financing alternatives to cover these requirements, including both equity and debt, and intends to explore the possibility and conditions for issuing a new corporate bond in the Company

3

on terms similar to the Bonds issued on 28 June 2013. The purpose would be to refinance the current Bonds and raise financing for the project pipeline.

The Terms and Conditions limit the possibility to finance investments in the North American operations, mainly due to restrictions on obtaining additional guarantees from the U.S. parent company, Index Enterprise LLC.

The Company is therefore proposing adjustments of the Terms and Conditions, enabling the Company to refinance the Bonds through an adjusted early call, at a significant premium payable to the Holders, if this is deemed required in order to go ahead with the projects in the U.S. If the Company decides to buy back the Bonds with the proposed new call option the Holders would receive 106.50% ofthe Nominal Amount plus accrued but unpaid interest.

In the event that the Holders do not approve the amendments detailed in this procedure in writing, the Company intends to call the existing Bonds in accordance with the current Terms and Conditions. The Company expects to obtain cash amounting to SEK 195 million from one of their Joint Venture Companies during May 2014. They will therefore fulfil the terms for a Joint Venture Distribution Event and will be obliged to trigger the Mandatory Partial Prepayment by 28 September 2014. Accordingly, the Company would in such case prepay SEK 195 million, or 70.9% of the Nominal Amount of the outstanding Bonds, at a premium of 2.00% (total amount SEK 198.9 million). The Company intends to, in such case, also use its First Call Option by 28 June 2015 for the remaining SEK 80 million, or 29.1% ofthe Nominal Amount of the outstanding Bonds, at a premium of 5.00% (total amount SEK 84.0 million).
