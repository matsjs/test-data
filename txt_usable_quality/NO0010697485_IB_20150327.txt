Director's report
Bluew ater Holding B.V. is the holding company of a group of companies (`the Bluew ater group' or `the Company'), primarily engaged in the supply of services and products to the oil industry. Bluew ater designs, develops, ow ns and operates floating production storage and offloading units (``FPSOs''), provides auxiliary equipment and services to FPSOs and designs, develops and manages the construction of single point mooring systems (``SPM s''). The Company has an FPSO fleet consisting of 5 high specification FPSOs that are or w ill be operated under medium- to long-term service agreements or bareboat charter agreements w ith reputable oil companies. Currently the Company has FPSOs in operation on the UK Continental Shelf and offshore East Timor.
Business performance The net loss after tax for 2014 w as U.S.$143.4 million compared to U.S.$98.6 million loss in 2013. EBITDA in 2014 w as U.S.$180.1 million compared to U.S.$216.0 million in 2013. The 2014 financial results w ere mainly impacted by the follow ing:
EBITDA for the SPM division amounted to U.S.$36.7 million in 2014 compared to U.S.$38.1 million in 2013. During the fourth quarter, some SPM projects reached final stages of completion, resulting in a significant contribution to EBITDA. Other SPM projects reached significant progress and w ill continue to contribute to EBITDA during 2014.
The 2014 EBITDA for the FPSO division w as U.S.$150.1 million, compared to U.S.$189.5 million for the year 2013. The U.S.$39.4 million decrease in EBITDA compared to the year ended December 30, 2013 w as mainly caused by a U.S.$22.7 million decrease in EBITDA of the FPSO Haew ene Brim. This difference in EBITDA largely relates to a U.S.$25.7 million cost reimbursement for mooring leg repairs that w ere executed in 2012. The cost reimbursement w as recorded as benefit in 2013 and w as fully collected from our insurers and client during 2014. The remaining movement in EBITDA for the FPSO Haew ene Brim w as due to amortization of deferred revenue related to the Brynhild project, largely offset by increased maintenance costs and reduced income during the latter period of the Brynhild project. EBITDA for the FPSO Glas Dow r reduced by U.S.$5.8 million compared to the previous year, due to higher operational expenditures and dow ntime penalties, mainly resulting from equipment failures during the year, w hich have now been resolved. Additionally, EBITDA of the FPSO Aoka M izu decreased by U.S.$2.7 million due to declining field production and repair costs related to the w ater injection sw ivel. Furthermore, EBITDA of the FPSO Bleo Holm decreased by U.S.$7.0 million due to a decreased day rate as per the contract amendment that became effective August 1, 2014, combined w ith low tariff income as a result of low production in August and November and nil production in September and October. Finally the FPSO tender costs in 2014 increased by U.S.$1.2 million, mainly due to the tender activities in relation to the Pemex project for the FPSO M unin.
M odification and life time extension w ork on the FPSO Haew ene Brim to prepare the vessel for tie-in and production of the Brynhild field w as completed in November 2014 and the FPSO resumed production on the Pierce field on December 12, 2014. The costs related to the modification and life time extension w ork are fully reimbursed by the Brynhild field ow ners. During the year ended December 30, 2014, such costs, amounting to US$89.9 million, have been capitalized and related revenues have been deferred, resulting in nil impact on EBITDA. From December 2014, the total capitalized costs related to the Brynhild project amounting to U.S.$310.8 million are being depreciated and related deferred revenues are amortized and are thus recognized as income in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Consequently, an amount of U.S.$6.1 million revenue is included in EBITDA in the fourth quarter, w hich is offset by an equal amount of depreciation, w ith nil net effect on profit and loss.
Overhead costs for the year 2014 w ere U.S.$6.6 million versus U.S.$11.6 million for the year 2013. The decrease in overhead costs w as largely driven by an increased recovery on overhead costs as a result of a higher w orkload of the engineering organization compared to the year 2013. Additionally, Euro denominated costs decreased as a result of the decreasing Euro --- Dollar exchange rate during the last quarter.
3

Depreciation expenditure decreased by U.S.$7.8 million, at U.S.$83.9 million for the year 2014, compared to U.S.$91.7 million for the year 2013. The decrease w as driven by one of the assets being fully depreciated, partly offset by an increase in the depreciation charge of FPSO Haew ene Brim follow ing completion of the Brynhild project.
Finance expenses for the year 2014 are U.S.$4.1 million higher compared to the previous year, at U.S.$212.5 million versus U.S.$208.4 million in 2013. Interest costs are mainly driven by the subordinated loan due to parent company carrying 9.75% interest per year. The finance expense on this loan increased from U.S.$132.9 million in 2013 to U.S.$145.9 million in 2014. The interest expense related to this loan is accrued to the loan and has therefore no cash impact. Furthermore, finance expense for the year 2013 included U.S.$14.5 million of non-recurring costs in relation to the refinancing of the Glas Dow r project financing, amendments of the corporate facility and refinancing of the U.S.$360 million unsecured bond, compared to only U.S.$0.4 million of non-recurring costs in relation to the cancellation of the interest rate sw ap on the U.S.$360 million unsecured bond loan for the year 2014. Finance expense for the bond loan increased by U.S.$12.6 million, from U.S.$28.8 million for the year 2013 to U.S.$41.4 million for the year 2014. The year 2014 includes U.S.$40.0 million interest on the new U.S.$400 million bond loan and U.S.$1.4 million interest in relation to the U.S.$360 million unsecured bond loan that w as repaid on January 27, 2014, compared to U.S.$26.5 million interest on the U.S.$360 million unsecured bond and U.S.$2.3 million accrued interest on the new U.S.$400 million bond loan in the year 2013. Other interest costs decreased by U.S.$7.4 million during the year 2014 compared to the year 2013. This decrease resulted from further reduction in net debt, resulting from steady operating cash flow .
Currency exchange results w ere U.S.$19.4 million negative in the year 2014 compared to U.S.$3.1 million positive in the year 2013. The currency exchange results relate mainly to the negative fair value of Euro denominated forw ard currency contracts that w ere entered into to hedge the currency exposure on SPM projects.
Income tax expense for the year 2014 w as U.S.$7.8 million versus U.S.$17.7 million for the year 2013. The income tax expense in the year 2014 relates to U.S.$6.7 million w ithholding tax incurred in relation to the Glas Dow r revenues, U.S.$1.4 million corporate taxes in other jurisdictions and U.S.$0.3 million increase of the deferred tax asset. The U.S.$17.7 million income tax expense in the year 2013 included a U.S.$7.9 million reduction of the deferred tax asset, U.S.$6.8 million w ithholding tax incurred in relation to the Glas Dow r revenues and U.S.$3.0 million of other foreign taxes.
Other developments On M ay 26, 2014, a major SPM contract w as aw arded for the engineering and related procurement and construction of tw o turret and sw ivel systems, w ith total revenues amounting to circa U.S.$300 million. This project is expected to start contributing to EBITDA early 2015.
On June 30, 2014, a legal dispute that arose from the ordinary course of business several years ago, w ith Bluew ater as claimant, w as resolved in Bluew ater's favour resulting in a preliminary claim aw ard of U.S.$6.4 million. On September 30, 2014, final settlement w as reached, resulting in an additional claim aw ard of U.S.$4.3 million. The total claim aw ard of U.S.$10.7 million is included in the SPM result for 2014 and has been fully collected.
On November 5, 2014, a contract extension option for the FPSO Bleo Holm w as exercised by our client, w ith retrospective effect from August 1, 2014. The bareboat charter agreement has been extended w ith a firm 3-year period until August 1, 2017, w ith annual extension options thereafter, and the charter hire rate and production tariff have been adjusted from this date.
On November 17, 2014, Bluew ater has relocated its head office to an entirely new building not far from its former premises. It has been designed in accordance w ith the latest principles on sustainability and w ill provide a modern and healthy w ork environment that enhances cooperation and communication.

Outlook The outlook for our FPSO activities remains positive. The FPSO Glas Dow r, the FPSO Haew ene Brim, the FPSO Bleo Holm and the FPSO Aoka M izu are currently operating under medium to long-term service agreements w ith potential for further extensions. The FPSO M unin is currently laid up in Batam, Indonesia, and contract discussions about redeployment of the vessel are currently in an advanced stage. To prepare the vessel for redeployment, a significant investment w ill be made, w hich w ill be partially funded w ith new stand-alone project financing. M argins in the SPM segment are stable and our SPM order portfolio is expected to continue contributing significantly to EBITDA. The order book for our SPM business, combined w ith modification and life time extension w ork to be performed on our FPSOs is expected to keep the level of utilization of the organisation relatively high. Considering the SPM order portfolio and FPSO contracts, long term cash flow stability of the Company is expected to be positive.
Our policy is to maintain qualified engineering staff that is experienced in the design and development of both FPSOs and SPM systems. To ensure flexibility and manage costs, w e allocate staff members betw een our FPSO and SPM business in response to market conditions and specific project demands. To protect itself from fluctuations in the level of activities, the Company uses the services of contractors in addition to its permanent staff.
Corporate governance Under Dutch law , the Company has been considered a Public Interest Entity in 2013 and as such is required to have an audit committee or a similar body. The Company has a Financial Accounting and Supervision Committee, w hich performs the duties of an audit committee, consisting of tw o members, of w hich at least one member is independent w ithin the meaning of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The sole statutory director of the Company is M r H.J. Heerema. As of January 27, 2014 the Company is listed on the Nordic ABM and as such no longer classifies as a Public Interest Entity as of this date.
Financial instruments With most of its revenue in US dollars the Company is exposed to currency exchange fluctuations. In addition, the Company is exposed to the risk of fluctuations of the value of financial instruments due to changes in the market rate of interest. The Company uses (in the normal course of business) various types of financial instruments w ith the objective to minimize these currency and interest rate risks. Procedures and policies are in place to control risks related to financial instruments, including a clear segregation of duties betw een operating, settlement, accounting and controlling of all financial instruments used. The Company's management is involved in the risk management process. The Company attempts to minimize the counterparty credit risk associated w ith the financial instruments used by selecting counterparties that it believes to be creditw orthy.
Research and development The Company focuses its research and development activities on technology that is integral to our FPSO and SPM businesses. We have an in-house design and engineering team consisting of engineers trained in a number of disciplines. We also access new sources of information or technology by entering into strategic alliances w ith equipment manufacturers, oil and gas companies, universities or by participating in joint industry programs. While the market for our products and services is subject to continuous technological changes, development cycles from initial conception through introduction can extend over several years. Our efforts have resulted in the development of a number of inventions, new processes and techniques, many of w hich have been incorporated as improvements to our product lines. Our research and development activity has led to a number of patents or patent applications, principally in the area of SPM systems. During 2014 and 2013, our research and development expenditures w ere USD 2.7 million and USD 3.4 million, respectively. We expect to expend similar amounts on research and development in future periods.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. General information
Reporting entity Bluew ater Holding B.V. (``the Company'') is domiciled in the Netherlands. The address of the Company's registered office is Taurusavenue 46, 2132 LS Hoofddorp. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended December 30, 2014 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ``Group'' or ``Bluew ater'' and individually as ``Group entities'') and the Group's interest in jointly controlled entities. The Group is primarily engaged in the supply of services and products to the oil industry. The Company's immediate parent is Bluew ater Offshore Production Systems Ltd. The Company's next most senior parent that issues consolidated financial statements is Aurelia Energy N.V., Willemstad (Curaçao). The Company is ultimately w holly ow ned by Aurelia Holding N.V., Willemstad (Curaçao), of w hich all shares are ultimately held by the Jacaranda Trust, an irrevocable discretionary trust constituted under the law s of Jersey. The beneficiaries of the Jacaranda Trust are M r. H. Heerema and certain members of his immediate family. The trustees of the Jacaranda Trust are prohibited from exercising their pow er in a manner that w ould result in M r. H. Heerema being dismissed or replaced as Bluew ater Holding B.V.'s sole managing director w ithout his prior w ritten consent.
Activities Bluew ater is a specialized service provider to, and operator in, the offshore oil industry. Bluew ater designs, develops, ow ns and operates floating production storage and offloading unit s (``FPSOs''), provides auxiliary equipment and services to FPSOs and designs, develops and performs project management and constructs single point mooring systems (``SPM s'').
An FPSO is a type of floating production unit used by oil companies to produce, process, store and offload hydrocarbons from offshore fields. FPSOs are either new ly built or converted tankers upon w hich production equipment is mounted. The fluids (oil, gas and w ater) are processed on board the FPSO vessel, and the treated crude oil is stored before being exported to an off take system utilizing shuttle tankers. Bluew ater's fleet of FPSOs is involved in the production, rather than the exploration or drilling phase of oil field development. The FPSOs are leased to oil companies under medium- and long-term service contracts or bareboat contracts.
SPM s are used to transfer fluids to and from a floating production unit, an offshore storage vessel or shuttle tanker w hile securing the unit, vessel or tanker to the ocean floor. M ost SPM s consist of an anchoring system that is connected to the ocean floor and a fluid transfer system that permits the transfer of fluids betw een fixed and rotating parts of the mooring system. SPM s are generally developed and constructed for oil companies and contractors.
Revenues are earned from day rates consisting of a fixed facility fee and a compensation for operating the FPSO pursuant to leases w ith oil companies, supplemented from time to time w ith fees based on volumes of produced barrels of oil. Additionally, revenues are earned on a lump-sum or reimbursable basis from the design, engineering, procurement and management services that are provided in the various FPSO and SPM projects being managed.
FPSO and SPM projects are being managed from the initial design and engineering phase to final installation. Further, Bluew ater engages subcontractors in the fabrication of FPSOs, SPM s and auxiliary equipment.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance w ith Internat ional Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations adopted and endorsed by the European Union.
The financial statements w ere approved by the Board of Directors on M arch 26, 2015.

2. Basis of preparation

These consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of US dollars, w hich is the Company's functional currency. All financial information presented has been rounded to the nearest thousand. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are stated at fair value.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity w ith IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are review ed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in w hich the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

In particular, significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are:

 Revenue recognition on construction contracts based on the percentage of completion method;  Estimation of the anticipated useful life and future revenues earned w ith the leased facilities;  Estimation of the realizable amount of tax losses carried forw ard;  Potential impact of claims and litigation.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting. The parent company Aurelia Energy N.V. has furthermore confirmed that it continues its financial support to the Company to enable it to operate as a going concern and to meet at least its financial obligations for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of Bluew ater Holding B.V.'s financial statements for the period ended December 30, 2014.

3. Significant accounting policies

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities.

(a)

Basis of consolidation

The financial information relating to Bluew ater Holding B.V. is presented in the consolidated financial statements. In accordance w ith article 2:402 of the Dutch Civil Code, the company financial statements only contain an abridged income statement.

(i)

Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists w hen the Group has the pow er to govern the

financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control,

potential voting rights that currently are exercisable are taken into account. The financial statements of

subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until

the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed w hen necessary to

align them w ith the policies adopted by the Group.

(ii)

Joint ventures

Joint ventures are those entities over w hose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual

agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic, financial and operating decisions. The consolidated

financial statements include the Group's proportionate share of the joint venture's assets, liabilities, revenue

and expenses, w ith items of a similar nature on a line basis, from the date that joint control commences until

the date that joint control ceases.

13

(iii)

Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group

transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

(b)

Foreign currency

(i)

Foreign currency transactions and balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities at

exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. M onetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign

currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The

resulting exchange gains and losses are recorded under financial income and expense in the consolidated

statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, except w here hedge accounting is applied.

(ii)

Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into US dollars at exchange rates at the reporting

date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into US dollars at exchange rates at the

dates of the transactions. Gains and losses resulting from the translation are recorded in shareholder's equity,

as translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the

translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss.

Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of w hich is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognized directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.

(c)

Financial instruments

(i)

Non-derivative financial instruments

Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity securities, trade and other receivables,

cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrow ings, and trade and other payables.

Non-derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through profit or loss, any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below .

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flow s.

Available-for-sale financial assets The Group's investments in equity securities are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. Listed equity investments are stated at fair value. Since there is no w ay of reliably measuring the fair value using valuation techniques for some of these investments that are unlisted, these unlisted investments are stated at historical cost less any identified impairment losses. Changes in the fair value of the equity investments are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the investment revaluation reserve. When an investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss accumulated in the investment revaluation reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.

Other Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.

14

(ii)

Derivative financial instruments

Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss

The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forw ard contracts, interest rate sw aps and interest

rate caps to hedge its risks associated w ith foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. Such financial

instruments are initially recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position as either an asset or a

liability measured at fair value. Changes in the derivative instrument's fair value are recognized in profit or loss,

unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. All derivative financial instrument valuations are determined in

part by reference to published price quotations in an active market. These quotations consist of currency

exchange rates, interest rates, and discount rates. Attributable transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss

w hen incurred.

Cash flow hedges Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the hedged item is a nonfinancial asset, the amount recognized in equity is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset w hen it is recognized. In other cases the amount recognized in equity is transferred to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.

(iii)

Share capital

Ordinary shares

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares

and share options are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

(d)

Property, plant and equipment

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a w orking condition for its intended use, borrow ing costs paid during construction and attributable overhead.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item only if it is probable that future economic benefits embodied w ithin the part w ill flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment, taking into account its residual value. Depreciation of assets starts w hen they are available for their intended use.

15

The estimated useful lives for the categories of property, plant and equipment are as follow s:

 hulls, including cost of vessel conversion

20-25 years

 sw ivel stack

15 years

 machinery and process equipment

3-10 years

(In case of long-term contracts greater than 10 years, these items are fully depreciated over the contract

duration. For shorter term contracts, a decision is made as to the applicable useful life).

 office equipment

4 years

 other

4-10 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are review ed at each reporting date.

Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal w ith the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognized net w ithin profit or loss.

(e)

Intangible assets

(i)

Research and development

Expenditure on research activities, undertaken w ith the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical

know ledge and understanding, is recognized in profit or loss w hen incurred.

Development expenditure is capitalized only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials and direct labour, borrow ing costs paid during development and attributable overhead costs.

Capitalized development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis from the date they are available for use, over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets not exceeding 20 years.

(ii)

Oil production licences and field development costs

Capitalized expenditures related to the acquisition of oil production licenses and field development s are

measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is

recognized in profit or loss from the date the field starts production as the related oil and gas reserves are

produced under the unit of production method. Field development costs are capitalized in accordance w ith IFRS

6.

(iii)

Software costs

Capitalized expenditures related to the acquisition and development of softw are are measured at cost less

accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognized in profit or loss from

the date the softw are is available for use, over the estimated useful lives of the softw are of 5 years.

(f)

Inventories

Inventories are measured at the low er of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle, and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condit ion. In the case of manufactured inventories and w ork in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of 16

completion and selling expenses.

(g)

Construction contracts

Construction contracts are measured at cost plus profit recognized to date less progress billings and recognized losses. Cost includes all expenditure related directly to specific projects and an allocation of fixed and variable overheads incurred in the Group's contract activities based on normal operating capacity.

If payments received from customers exceed the income recognized, then the difference is presented under deferred income in the consolidated statement of financial position.

(h)

Impairment

The carrying amounts of financial assets and assets that are subject to amortization or depreciation are review ed at each reporting date to determine w hether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together at the low est level for w hich there are separately identifiable cash flow s (the ``cash-generating unit'').

An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, except for assets w ith indefinite useful lives.

(i)

Employee benefits

(i)

Defined contribution plans

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an employee benefit

expense in profit or loss w hen they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that

a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.

(ii)

Defined benefit plans

Provisions for pension obligations are established for benefits payable in the form of retirement and surviving

dependant pensions. The funds are valued every year by professionally qualified independent actuaries. The

obligations and costs of pension benefits are determined using the projected unit credit method. The projected

unit credit method considers each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and

measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.

The pension obligation is measured at the present value of estimated future cash flow s using a discount rate that is similar to the interest rate of Dutch government bonds, w here the currency and terms of the government bond are consistent w ith the currency and estimated terms of the defined benefit obligation.

The liability recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets.

Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the consolidated statement of financial position w ith a charge or credit recognised in employee benefits reserve in other comprehensive income in the period in w hich they occur. Re-measurement recognised in other
17

comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and w ill not be reclassified to profit or loss.

(j)

Provisions

. A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation

that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits w ill be required to settle

the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flow s at a pre-tax rate that

reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. No

provision for the costs of demobilization of FPSOs at the end of the lease period is accounted for, if the lease

contract provides for reimbursement of such costs by the lessee.

(k)

Revenue

(i)

Service agreements and/or operating lease arrangements for FPSOs

Revenues under service agreements and/or lease arrangements are recognized w hen the FPSO is made

available to the lessee and the fee is due in accordance w ith the lease contract. Income under the lease

agreements for the FPSOs comprises, depending on the vessel, the follow ing:

 A facility fee representing a prescribed fee for the lease period. This fee may be increased or decreased based on actual availability of the FPSO, including an allow ance for planned maintenance dow ntime versus pre-determined thresholds.
 A fee for operating the FPSO.

Where applicable, lease revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimal non-cancellable lease term.

(ii)

Construction contracts

Contract revenue from construction (design, engineering and project management) of SPM s and auxiliary

equipment includes the initial amount agreed in the contract plus any variations in contract w ork, claims and

incentive payments to the extent that it is probable that they w ill result in revenue and can be measured reliably.

As soon as the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue and expenses

are recognized in profit or loss in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract.

The stage of completion is measured by the labour and material cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated labour and material cost for each contract, unless the physical progress significantly differs. When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognized only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are likely to be recoverable. An expected loss on a contract is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

(l)

Government grants

Government grants that compensate the Company for expenses incurred are recognized in profit or loss on a

systematic basis in the same periods in w hich the expenses are recognized, provided there is reasonable

assurance that the Company w ill comply w ith the conditions attached to the grant and the grants w ill be

received.

(m)

Finance income and expenses

Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair

value through profit or loss and gains on hedging instruments that are recognized in profit or loss. Interest

income is recognized as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.

Finance expenses comprise interest expense on borrow ings, unw inding of the discount on provisions, changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, impairment losses recognized on financial assets and losses on hedging instruments that are recognized in profit or loss. Borrow ing costs are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method, except for borrow ing costs that qualify for capitalization.
18

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

(n)

Income tax

The income tax charge is based on the tax regime applicable to the various group com panies in the countries in

w hich they are legally seated. These tax regimes charge income taxes based on operating profits or on the

basis of other criteria as agreed upon by the Group in specific tax rulings. Deferred taxation is considered in

accounting for the income tax charge for the year.

Deferred income taxes are accounted for using the balance sheet method. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences betw een the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Future tax benefits attributable to these differences, if any, are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is probable.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

(o)

New standards and interpretations

The follow ing new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been adopted in 2014:

IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, IAS 27 (as revised in 2011) Separate Financial Statements and IAS 28 (as revised in 2011) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures have become effective from January 1, 2014. The adoption of these standards has not had an impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company has full control over the joint ventures in w hich it currently participates and consequently these joint ventures are fully consolidated as disclosed in note 26.

A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended December 30, 2014, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

4. Financial risk management

In the normal course of business the Company uses various types of financial instruments based on financial policies and procedures as agreed by the Company's management. Financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise accounts receivable, cash, deposits, long-term and short-term loans and accounts payable. The Company also uses derivative transactions; including principally forw ard rate currency contracts, interest rate sw aps and interest rate caps, w ith the purpose to manage the interest and currency risk arising from the Company's operations and sources of finance.

The Company has procedures and policies in place to control risks related to financial instruments. These policies and procedures include a clear segregation of duties betw een operating, settlement, accounting and controlling of all financial instruments used. The spread of the Company's activities limits the exposure to concentrations of credit or market risk. The Company's management is involved in the risk management process. The Company attempts to minimize the counterparty credit risk associated w ith the financial instruments used by selecting counterparties that it believes to be creditw orthy.

Credit risk The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Company attempts to minimize its credit risk as much as possible by thoroughly review ing risks associated w ith contracts and negotiating bank or parent company guarantees from customers. Additionally, milestone payments are negotiated on lump-sum contracts and outstanding receivables are actively managed in order to minimize the number of days outstanding.

19

Liquidity risk The Company has organized its liquidity management centrally, in order to ensure, as far as possible, that it w ill alw ays have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities w hen due, under both normal and stressed conditions, w ithout incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.
Currency risk The Company is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities. The Company uses forw ard exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk. When necessary, forw ard exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity.
Interest rate risk The Company's exposure to changes in interest rates on borrow ings is mitigated by entering into interest rate sw aps and interest rate caps.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group w ill be able to continue as a going concern w hile maximizing the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, w hich includes the borrow ings disclosed in note 18, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to the shareholder of the Company. The Group's goal is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. M anagement monitors the capital structure and return on capital, including the cost of capital and the associated risks. The Group's overall approach to capital management remained unchanged during the year.
5. Non-IFRS financial performance measures
The Company uses certain non-IFRS financial performance measures in its financial statements and for the calculation of certain financial covenant ratios as required under its financing agreements. The definitions and calculation of some of these non-IFRS financial performance measures are as follow s:
EBITDA; defined as operating result before depreciation, amortization, finance expense and taxes.
Interest bearing debt; defined as the amended corporate credit facility net of debt arrangement fees plus the senior secured project finance facility net of debt arrangement fees and debt service reserve account plus the unsecured subordinated bond net of debt arrangement fees and debt service reserve account.

6. Segment information

The disclosure of segment information is consistent w ith the internal reports regularly review ed by the Group's Chief Operating Decision M aker in order to assess each segment's performance and to allocate resources to them. Internal reporting is primarily based on business segments since the Company's risks and rates of return
20

are affected primarily by differences in services and products produced. Additionally information is reported geographically. EBITDA is defined as operating result excluding amortization, depreciation and impairment charge. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as w ell as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly head office expenses, investments and related revenue and income tax assets and liabilities. For both presented periods there are no inter segment revenues. The presentation of revenues by geographical segments is determined by the client's country of domicile. No revenues w ere generated and no assets are located in the Company's country of domicile. The presentation of assets by geographical segments is based on the geographical location of the assets.

As of December 31, 2013, certain FPSO related costs previously treated as unallocated are presented as part of the FPSO segment. The 2013 figures have been restated accordingly, resulting in a U.S.$2.4 million decrease of FPSO EBITDA and unallocated expenses.

Several major customers in the FPSO and SPM segment have been identified, that each contributes to 10 percent or more of total revenues individually. In 2014, revenues from three such major customers amounted to U.S.$150.8 million, U.S.$99.2 million and U.S.$65.1 million respectively. In 2013, revenues from four such major
21

customers amounted to U.S.$145.6 million, U.S.$97.6 million, U.S.$73.6 million and U.S.$65.8 million respectively.

The effective tax rate for financial statement purposes differs from the statutory tax rate, mainly because the Company is subject to taxation in various countries w ith different statutory tax rates and taxable results vary in the various countries involved. Additionally, some group companies have significant tax losses carried forw ard, for w hich no (full) deferred tax asset is recognized. Consequently, the Company's taxable result may differ from the operating result.

The costs related to the modification and life time extension w ork to prepare the vessel for tie-in and production of the Brynhild field are fully reimbursed by the Brynhild field ow ners. During the year ended December 30, 2014, such costs, amounting to US$89.9 million, have been capitalized and related revenues have been deferred, resulting in nil impact on EBITDA. Income recognition of the deferred revenues of U.S.$310.8 million started in December 2014 and w ill be offset by depreciation of the capitalized costs.
FPSO under construction relates to the FPSO M unin that came off contract on September 30, 2011. As of December 30, 2014, an amount of U.S.$ 101.5 million (2013: U.S.$101.5 million) relating to capitalized interest is included in the historical cost value of the FPSOs and FPSOs under construction.

2013

The deferred tax assets relate to the group companies in the Netherlands. The tax loss carry-forw ards in the Netherlands result primarily from the amortization of goodw ill and interest expense on intercompany debt w hich resulted from an internal restructuring that w as previously entered into w ith effect from January 1, 2000. Additionally, the tax loss carry-forw ard increased due to operational losses in prior years. It is anticipated that the tax loss carry-forw ards w ill be largely realized in 2015, due to expected tax profits resulting from a planned transfer of assets to new ly established group entities. This anticipated transfer of assets w ill result in an increased tax value of these assets. The Company has analysed the future realization of the remaining losses carried forw ard as w ell as the temporary difference in book value, considering the Company's history of earnings, projected earnings based on current contracts as w ell as future contracts, the applicable tax rate, the new rules regarding limitation of deductibility of interest and the maximum carry forw ard period of the tax losses. Based on this analysis, the Company concluded that it is probable that an estimated amount resulting from temporary differences resulting in a deferred tax asset of U.S.$56.0 million w ill be fully realized.

At December 30, 2014 the Company has loss carry forw ards in the Netherlands of a total nominal amount of U.S.$658.8 million expiring betw een 2016 and 2020. The follow ing table specifies the years in w hich the Company's loss carry forw ards w ill expire:

The plan is subject to the regulations as stipulated in the Pensions Act (in Dutch: Pensioenw et). As stipulated in the Pensions Act the plan needs to be fully funded and needs to be operated outside the Company by a separate legal entity. The plan has been insured by a third-party insurance company. Consequently, most of the risks associated w ith the plan have been transferred to this third-party insurance company and the funding requirements are determined by the third-party insurance company. The insurance company guarantees that all pension entitlements that have been accrued until December 31, 2014 are paid to the pension plan participants and is responsible for operating the plan in accordance w ith the pension agreement. The insurance company is also responsible for the investment policy w ith regard to the assets. The plan assets are deemed to be equal to the accrued pensions and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the plan assets is equal to the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation. The Company has no additional responsibilities for the governance of the pension plan. The risks associated w ith the plan that remain w ith the Company are limited to salary risk, risk of individual value transfers and the risk of default by the insurance company.

The Company is currently finalizing a new pension plan, under w hich employees w ill be entitled to post-retirement yearly instalments amounting to 1.75% of final salary in excess of a deductible of EUR13.5 thousand and up to a maximum of EUR78.0 thousand, for each year of service until retirement age of 67. The new plan w ill be insured by a third-party insurance company. The Company is subject to the risk that the tariffs included in the new financing agreement may change once the new pension plan and insurance contract become effective. The previous pension agreement ended January 1, 2015 and changing tariffs may impact the pension contributions from that date onw ards.

As a consequence of changes in the fiscal legislation in the Netherlands as per January 1, 2014, the Company has amended the pension plan as per this date, w hereby the pensionable age has been increased from 65 years to 67 years.

The fiscal legislation in the Netherlands has changed again as per January 1, 2015. Since agreement for adjusting scheme has not been reached before December 30, 2014, this past service cost is not recorded in fiscal year 2014.

Based on past experience, the Company believes that no further impairment allow ance is necessary in respect of past due trade receivables. The allow ance accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Company is satisfied that no recovery of the amount ow ing is possible; at that point the amount considered irrecoverable is w ritten off against the financial asset directly.

Cash flow hedges As per December 30, 2014 and December 30, 2013 there are no forw ard exchange contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Exposure to currency risk The Company's revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and, to a lesser extent, Pound sterling and euro. In 2014, approximately £43.0 million (U.S.$67.0 million) of the Company's revenues w as denominated in Pound sterling, approximately 118.3 million (U.S.$143.8 million) w as denominated in euro and approximately R$12.2 million (U.S.$4.6 million) w as denominated in Brazilian real. The Company's expenses are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars and to a lesser degree, euro, Pound sterling and several other currencies. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, because a portion of its expenses and financial indebtedness is denominated in currencies that are different from the Company's revenues. The Company's policy is to match, through our FPSO service agreements, the revenues in a particular currency w ith its operating costs in that currency, thereby minimizing the risk associated w ith fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also matches its indebtedness denominated in U.S. dollars w ith its revenues
34

denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company purchases foreign currency exchange contracts from financial institutions to the extent of any residual exposure. The Company manages its outstanding currency exposure on a regular basis and nets these exposures across its operations as a group. Gains and losses related to specific currency transactions are recognized as part of its income from financing activities.

In the years 2014 and 2013 the Company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts in relation to projects to hedge against the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for expenditures in currencies other than the project currency. The Company may designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges. For such contracts designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges gains and losses related to project specific currency transactions are recognized as part of the hedging reserve.

Sensitivity analysis A ten percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar against the above currencies at December 30, 2014 w ould have increased (decreased) the value of the forw ard exchange contracts by approximately U.S.$14.8 million. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.

Interest rate risk Profile The majority of our indebtedness consists of a subordinated parent company loan, advances under our credit facility, the project financing and our unsecured subordinated bond. We expect that in the future w e w ill continue to have significant indebtedness due to the parent company and under our credit facility and that our unsecured subordinated bond w ill continue to be outstanding. Advances under the credit facility, the project financing and the subordinated loan bear interest at rates typically expressed as a margin over the appropriate interbank rate. At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Group's interest-bearing financial instruments w as as follow s:

In thousands of U.S.$

Carrying amount 2014

2013

Fixed rate financial liabilities Variable rate financial liabilities

(2,299,084) -

(2,229,601) (46,063)

Under the documentation of the Senior secured project finance facility, the Company is required at any time to have financial instruments in place to mitigate the interest risk to at least 75% of the total amount outstanding under the facility. To this end, the Company entered into a floating to fixed interest rate sw ap, thereby fixing the interest on the facility including margin at 4.9125% . The interest rate sw ap is effective starting August 28, 2013 until February 28, 2018.

To limit the interest exposure on the unsecured subordinated U.S.$360 million bond due 2014, the Company purchased an interest rate sw ap on December 6, 2007 that enabled the Company to sw ap the variable interest payable on the bond for a fixed interest of 4.24% , thereby fixing the interest on the bond including margin at 7.24% . The interest rate sw ap w as effective starting January 17, 2008 until July 17, 2014. On January 29, 2014 the interest rate sw ap in relation to the U.S.$360.0 million unsecured bond loan due July 17, 2014 w as cancelled. Costs related to ineffectiveness of this sw ap amounting to U.S.$6.8 million have been recorded as interest expense in 2013.

35

Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group does not designate derivatives as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge accounting model. Therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date w ould not affect profit or loss.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments Interest sensitivity w ill remain for the amended corporate credit facility. How ever at December 30, 2014 the outstanding balance is nil. A change of 50 basis points in interest rates compared to the interest rates at the reporting date w ould therefore have no effect on the profit or loss.

Fair values versus carrying amounts The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from the carrying amounts, except for the fair value of the unsecured subordinated U.S.$400 million bond, w hich amounts to U.S.$373.0 million as per December 30, 2014.

The Company uses the follow ing fair value hierarchy for financial instruments that are measured at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position: the fair value of financial assets that are traded on an active liquid market are determined w ith reference to the quoted market price (level 1), fair values of forw ard exchange contracts, interest rate sw aps and interest rate caps are based on quotes from banks (level 2). The Company does not use pricing models to determine fair values (level 3).

24. Operating leases Leases as lessee Annual lease obligations entered into w ith third parties in connection w ith building and office space and cars, extending through fiscal year 2029, amount to a total of U.S.$52,001. Operational lease expenses in 2014 amounted to U.S.$3,482 (2013: U.S.$3,500). Non-cancellable operating lease rentals are payable as follow s:

25. Commitments and contingencies Claims and suits From time to time, the Company is subject to various claims arising out of the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate result of all such matters is not presently determinable, based upon current know ledge and facts, management does not expect that their resolution w ill have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operation.

Independent auditor's report
To: the Shareholder and M anagement Board of Bluew ater Holding B.V.
Report on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying financial statements 2014 of Bluew ater Holding B.V., Hoofddorp. The financial statements include the consolidated financial statements and the company financial statements. The consolidated financial statements comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as per December 30, 2014, the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flow s for the year then ended, and notes, comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. The company financial statements comprise the company balance sheet as per December 30, 2014 the company income statement for the year then ended and the notes, comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Management's responsibility M anagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance w ith International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and w ith Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and for the preparation of the Director's report in accordance w ith Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore management is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, w hether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance w ith Dutch law , including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. This requires that w e comply w ith ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about w hether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, w hether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as w ell as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence w e have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion with respect to the consolidated financial statements In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Bluew ater Holding B.V. as per December 30, 2014 and of its result and its cash flow s for the year then ended in accordance w ith International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and w ith Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
