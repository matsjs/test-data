To the bondholders

The funding of the capital increase is taking longer than originally anticipated.

Due to the above, VIEO B.V. is hereby affirmatively announcing the timeline for the Buy-Back Offer:

27 July: 30 July: 1 August 2 August 6 August

Announcement of Buy-Back Offer and distribution of Buy-Back Offer documents Commencement of Buy-Back Offer Period End Buy-Back Offer Period Announcement of result of the Buy-Back Offer Settlement

Should the capital increase be completed prior to 30 July 2018 the auction may commence earlier. VIEO is strongly committed to a successful completion.

On the business side, it is positive to note that Lebara's customer base has grown during Q2. Churn has continued to be controlled and ARPU is in line with expectations. Costs across the business continue to be managed carefully. During June an important refresh to the brand was initiated and this will roll out during the remainder of the year, increasing Lebara's relevance to a broader target audience.
