In addition to the above, the Parent has or is due to issue invoices to Pemex for the operation o f Rig 1 and Rig 2 under the Rig 1 Pemex Contract and Rig 2 Pemex Contract as from October 2017 onwards.1

Upon the Parent's receipt of the various payments from Pemex, transfers inter alia of the Bareboat Rate and other amounts shall be made to Rig 1 Owner, Rig 2 Owner and the Issuer in accordance with Clause 13.5.1 of the Bond Agreement.

On 3 January 2018 the Issuer is due to:

(i) pay interest on the Outstanding Bonds in the amount o f USD13,589,843.80 in accordance with Clause 9.1 of the Bond Agreement (the "January 2018 Interest Payment"); and

(ii) repay Outstanding Bonds in the amount of USD15,000,000.00 in accordance with Clause 10.1.1 (i) o f the Bond Agreement (the "January 2018 Instalment").

The consolidated cash o f the Issuer and the Rig Owners is as o f 21 December 2017 approximately USD 200,000.00 (excluding the amount of USD $5,000,000.00 standing on the Minimum Liquidity Account).

The Issuer intends to use part of the funds received from the Pemex Payment to pay the January 2018 Interest Payment. Considering that the Pemex Payment is expected during December 2017 and January 2018, the Issuer is proposing that the due date for the January 2018 Interest Payment is postponed until 30 January 2018 (the "January 2018 Interest Payment Postponement").

The Issuer is in the process o f considering alternatives for refinancing o f the remaining amount o f the Bond Issue prior to the Maturity Date on 3 July 2018. In order to allow some further time for consideration o f the refinancing alternatives, the Issuer is proposing that the due date for the January 2018 Instalment is postponed until the Maturity Date (the "January 2018 Instalment Payment Postponement").
