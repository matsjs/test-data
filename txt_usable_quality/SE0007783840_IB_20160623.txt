West Atlantic AB (publ) interest rate step up for corporate bond loan
As per the terms and conditions of the corporate bond loan (ISIN SE0007783840) the interest rate increases by 50 basis points, from but excluding the first Interest Payment Date up to and including the relevant redemption date. The new terms are fixed interest of 7.0 percent, per annum, paid semi-annually.
The step up in interest rate was conditioned against an equity contribution, meaning an injection of SEK 100,000,000 in the form of equity (unconditional shareholder contribution, share issue or otherwise) or Subordinated Loans.
"The board of directors have decided to postpone a potential equity injection following the decision to reduce growth targets for the year. All focus will instead be directed at increasing service quality, becoming more efficient and getting back to basics." - says Goran Berglund, Chairman of the Board.
