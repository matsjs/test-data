To the bondholders in:

Helsinki, 11 February 2016

KOTKAMILLS GROUP OY'S (FORMERLY EAGLE INDUSTRIES OY) EUR 105,000,000 SENIOR SECURED CALLABLE BONDS 2015/2020, ISIN: FI4000148705 (THE "BONDS")

1. BACKGROUND
We refer to the terms and conditions governing the Bonds dated 6 March 2015 (the "Terms and Conditions"). Capitalised terms used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Terms and Conditions.
The Issuer completed the acquisition of all shares in Kotkamills Oy (the "Target") on 25 March 2015. The Group currently has four major business lines: Absorbex®, Imprex®, Solaris® and sawmill.
Following the Completion, the Issuer has taken steps, along with steps to complete the PM2 Conversion, to improve performance and profitability of the Target by optimising and developing certain of the existing operations. As part of such efforts, the Issuer is contemplating entering into the following transactions:
(i) at any time prior to 31 December 2017, leasing the Target's sawmill operations and related equipment for a maximum period of ten (10) years to a third party tenant (the "Lessee") and transferring the administration and maintenance of the sawmill to the Lessee for a monthly leasing payment provided that such monthly leasing payment shall within twelve (12) months from the commencement of the lease period exceed the current monthly profit (calculated based on the average monthly profit during 2015) generated by the sawmill (the "Lease");
(ii) transferring employees of the Target currently working at the sawmill to the Lessee as existing workers in connection with the Lease;
(iii) selling the current sawmill inventory to the Lessee at market price in connection with the Lease; and
(iv) assigning the existing delivery and customer contracts relating to the sawmill to the Lessee in connection with the Lease,
(the transactions referred to in items (i) - (iv) together the "Transaction").
The Issuer estimates that the sawmill would require investments of approximately EUR 5 to 10 million to achieve desired capacity and profitability improvements. At the same time, the Issuer estimates that an equivalent investment in the Group's other business lines would create

higher profits for the Group. Against this background, the Issuer believes that the Transaction would be an attractive proposal both for the Group and the Lessee. The Transaction would also enable the Group to allocate more resources to the PM2 Conversion and, after the increase in sawmill's capacity through increased by-product supply, allocate additional resources to its other existing business lines. On the basis of the above, the Issuer is of the view is that there are sound business reasons for the Transaction.
According to the Issuer, completion of the Transaction does not affect the validity of the Transaction Security provided by the Target under the relevant Transaction Security Documents.
Pursuant to clause 13.6 (Disposal o f Assets) of the Terms and Conditions "the Issuer shall not, and shall procure that no Subsidiary, sell or otherwise dispose o f any business, assets or shares in any Subsidiary" unless specifically allowed under the Terms and Conditions and, therefore, the Issuer requires a consent from the Bondholders to complete the Transaction. For the Request (as defined below) to be approved by the Bondholders, Bondholders representing at least 66 2/3 per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Bondholders reply in the Written Procedure must consent to the Request.
The Issuer has requested the Trustee to choose a Written Procedure under which the Bondholders shall vote for the Request and provide the Bondholders with necessary instructions in respect of the procedure.
2. REQUEST
The Issuer requests the following consents and waivers from the Bondholders under the Terms and Conditions for the purpose of completing the Transaction:
(i) consent to the Transaction and confirmation and agreement that clause 13.6 (Disposal of Assets) of the Terms and Conditions shall not apply to the Transaction; and
(ii) granting of consequent waivers of the relevant provisions of the Terms and Conditions, including but not limited to clause 13.6 (Disposal o fAssets),
(the consents and waivers set out in items (i)-(ii) above jointly the "Request").
Except as set out in the Request with respect to the Transaction, the Terms and Conditions shall remain unamended.
