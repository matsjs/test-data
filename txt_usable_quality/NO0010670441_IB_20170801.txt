To the bondholders in: ISIN: NO0010670441 - FRN Siem Offshore Inc. Senior Unsecured Bond Issue
2013/2018
Oslo, 1 August 2017
Adjustment of coupon on next Interest Payment Date Nordic Trustee ASA acts as trustee (the "Bond Trustee") for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond") issued by Siem Offshore Inc. as issuer. Reference is made to the summons to bondholder's meeting (the "Summons") adopted by the Bondholders 12 April 2017, and to the Interest Payment Date 30 July 2017 (the "July Interest Payment Date"). Capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning as in the Summons. Interest paid on the July Interest Payment Date should have been based on a Margin of 4.00% p.a. pursuant to the Summons while the actual payment was incorrectly based on the original Margin of 4.75%. The Issuer has consequently paid and the Bondholders correspondingly received excessive interest of 0.75% p.a. of the aggregated Face Value of Outstanding Bonds (the "Outstanding Amount") for the relevant calculation period (the "Excessive Interest Amount") in connection with the July Interest Payment Date The Excessive Interest Amount will be offset against interest due at the 30 October 2017 Interest Payment Date (the "October Interest Payment Date"). Interest payment at the October Interest Payment Date will on this basis correspond to 4.04527% p.a. of the Outstanding Amount for the relevant calculation period.
Yours sincerely Nordic Trustee ASA
