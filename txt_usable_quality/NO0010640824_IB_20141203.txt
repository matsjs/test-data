We refer to the Bond Agreement. Words and expressions defined in the Bond Agreement shall have the same meaning in this letter, unless otherwise defined in it.
On 3 1 October 2014. the Issuer served a notice for payment to the Charterer (the "OGX Charter Invoice") in compliance with its obligations pursuant to Clause 8.3.1 o f the Charter Contract. Pursuant to the terms of the Charter Contract, the Charterer was obliged to make payment in respect o f the OGX Charter Invoice on or before 30 November 2014.
As a consequence o f the Charterer failing to comply with its obligations in respect o f the OGX Charter Invoice, the Issuer served notice on the Charterer in respect o f the payment default on 2 December 2014 (the '"Payment Default Notice"). Under clause 16.1 (a) o f the Charter Contract, an Owner Termination Event (as such term is defined in the Charter Contract) will be triggered 15 Business Days after service of the Payment Default Notice (assuming such payment is still outstanding by such date).
As the Issuer is a special purpose vehicle and the Charter Contract is its principal source o f income, as required by Clause 13.2.1 (a) and (b) o f the Bond Agreement, we hereby notify1you o f the occurrence of an event which may give rise to a Default and which may have a Material Adverse Effect on the financial condition o f the Issuer and the Issuer Parent.
We will endeavour to keep you updated on our discussions with the Charterer and will look to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.
