PROPOSAL TO AMEND REPAYMENT CLAUSE IN LOAN AGREEMENT SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING
Background
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as Bondholders' Representative for the abovecaptioned loan (the "Loan") where Aker Kværner ASA ("Aker Kværner" or the "Issuer") is the issuer. The Loan is divided into three tranches; a NOK tranche (AKVER56), an USD tranche (AKVER57) and an EUR tranche (AKVER58).
The Loan is a subordinated loan without any security. However, the loan agreement (as amended) related to the Loan (the "Loan Agreement") contains several covenants. Further, according to clause 10.2 of the Loan Agreement, the Issuer may at any time redeem the Loan at par value (100 %) plus accrued interest and accrued back end fee.
Aker Kværner has requested NTM to approach all bondholders in the Loan to obtain their consent to amend the Loan Agreement (the "Proposed Amendment") under which (if approved) Aker Kværner will have an option (additional to the one in Clause 10.2) to repay the entire Loan on 1 December 2006 on amended terms.
According to the Loan Agreement such consent requires 2/3 majority of the bonds represented at the bondholders' meeting. A bondholders' meeting is summoned by the NTM and will be held in the premises of Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, Haakon VII's gate 1, Oslo on 9 November 2006 at 13:00 hours (Oslo time).

The Loan
In 2001/2002 the Aker Kværner group (formerly a part of the Kværner group), after a period of considerable financial distress, went through a financial restructuring

process. As a part of the restructuring, approximately NOK 4.5 billion of debt was converted into subordinated long term debt, consisting of the Loan and the privately placed fixed rate notes in an amount of approximately USD 18 mill (the "U.S. Notes"). The Loan is non-interest bearing until 30 October 2006, and shall for the period from 30 October 2006 until 30 October 2011 bear interest at a fixed rate of 5 % p.a. payable annually. The bonds shall be wholly redeemed on the maturity date 30 October 2011. In addition the Issuer will on the maturity date pay a back end fee equivalent to 10/225 of the principal amount of the bonds. The U.S. Notes have terms and conditions corresponding to the terms and conditions of the bonds (Loan) and a similar proposal to amend the repayment terms of the U.S. Notes has been made to the holders of the U.S. Notes.

The Loan comprises three different ISIN (International Securities Identification Number), denominated in different currencies, NOK, USD and EUR respectively. Based on the currency exchange rate fixed at the issue date of the bonds ("Initial Exchange Ratio"), the nominal values of the three ISIN are as follows:

ISIN

The above calculated nominal amount in NOK has only relevance to the distribution of votes at the bondholders' meeting, where bondholders' holding of bonds denominated in USD or EUR shall have a number of votes for each bond equal to the value in NOK of the bond converted at the Initial Exchange Ratio.

The Proposed Amendment
Aker Kværner proposes to amend the Loan Agreement by adding a new clause 10.5 of the Loan Agreement, implying that Aker Kværner may make an early redemption of the entire Loan no later than 1 December 2006 at the price of 101.2 % of the principal amount of the Loan (for the avoidance of doubt, the said price of 101.2 %

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
includes accrued interest and accrued back end fee until the redemption day), which is approximately 98.6 % of the applicable call price on 1 December 2006 pursuant to the call provisions set forth in clause 10.2 of the Loan Agreement. In accordance with normal practise for Norwegian bond issues, redemption means that Aker Kværner will make the amount required for full settlement irrevocably available (on the relevant redemption date on or before 1 December 2006) for the paying agent (the issuer account operator), DnBNOR Bank ASA, for distribution through the VPS to the Bondholders.
The Proposed Amendment is put forward to the bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bondholders' Representative. It is recommended that the bondholders consult with tax advisors as to the possible tax consequences of the Proposed Amendment.
Aker Kværner has informed Norsk Tillitsmann that, as of the date hereof, holders of more than 67 % of the Bonds have agreed with Aker Kværner to vote in favour of the Proposed Amendment.
