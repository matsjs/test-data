We refer to letter to bondholders in Petromena ASA from the Informal Steering Committee of today and we will on behalf of Petromena ASA comment as follows:
The Company appreciate to have an open and close relationship and dialogue with all bondholders through Norsk Tillitsmann.
We note that the Informal Steering Committee now is stating that "there is no suggestion that a rig broker should be retained by the trustee at this stage. However, it may become necessary to appoint a rig broker to act on behalf of Bondholders at some point in the future."
During the negotiations of the Subsequent Agreement the Informal Steering Committee wanted to retain and control a rig broker to exclusively market for sale the Company's drilling units. In the Company's opinion this was the main reason for the failure to not agree on the Subsequent Agreement as this was impossible for the Company to accept.
The Bondholders may appoint such rig broker as they may desire without any comments from the Company. With respect to the other submissions in the letter we refer to our previous comments.
Best regards Knud Lorentzen
