Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this notice shall have the meaning given to them in the terms and conditions fo r the Notes (the "Terms and Condit ions") .

CorpNordic Sweden AB (the " A gent") acting in its capacity as agent for the Noteholders under the Terms and Conditions, hereby initiates a written procedure whereby the Noteholders can approve or reject a request made by the Issuer. The Issuer gives a background to the request and sets out the request in section A. (Request) below.
Noteholders participate by completing and sending the voting form attached below to the Agent. The Agent must receive the voting form no later than by 5 p.m. on 18 December 2014 by mail, via courier or e-mail to the addresses indicated below. Votes received thereafter will be disregarded. Noteholders that do not participate in the procedure will be deemed to have approved the Issuer's request.
To be eligible to participate in the written procedure a person must fulfill the formal criteria for being a Noteholder on 21 November 2014 (the "Record Date"). This means that the person must be registered on a Securities Account with Euroclear Sweden as a direct registered owner (direktregistreradägare) or authorised nominee (förvaltare) with respect to one or several Notes.
If you have an interest in a Note but are not registered as a direct registered owner or authorised nominee on a Securities Account, you need to obtain a power of attorney or other proof of authorisation from the person who fulfils the formal criteria for being a Noteholder on the Record Date, to be able to participate. An alternative may be to ask the person that is registered as a Noteholder and holds the Notes on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you. For further information on voting, please see under Voting rights in section B. (Decision procedure).

Please contact the securities firm you hold your Notes through if you do not know how your Notes are registered or if you need authorisation or other assistance to participate.
A. Request
Background This notice of written procedure is sent in relation to a potential change of control in MCB Finance Group pic (the " Parent"), pursuant to the announcement made on 18 November 2014 by the Parent that the Parent has received a takeover approach by International Personal Finance Pic ("IPF") regarding a potential cash offer for the Parent, (the occurrence of such event being a "Change of Control"). Following a Change of Control, the Parent may further be subject to a de-listing from the London Stock Exchange (AIM) (a " De-Listing"). For further details on IPF, please refer to http://ipfin.co.uk/. The Request (as defined below) is being sought to avoid an Event of Default under the Terms and Conditions as a result of a Change of Control and a subsequent De-Listing.
Request The Issuer is requesting a conditional waiver from the Noteholders relating to Clauses 16.1(m) and (n) of the Terms and Conditions in relation to a Change of Control and a subsequent De-Listing as set out below (the " Request"). In the event of a Change of Control resulting from an offer (the "Offer") or Scheme of Arrangement (the "Scheme") made in connection with a possible takeover of the Parent by IPF, such Offer or Scheme becoming effective before the Redemption Date, the Noteholders agree to waive the Event of Default under Clause 16.1(n) of the Terms and Conditions arising as result of the Change of Control and their right of acceleration of the notes pursuant to Clause 16.1 of the Terms and Conditions. The Noteholders further agree to waive the Event of Default under Clause 16.1(m) of the Terms and Conditions arising as result of a De-Listing following a Change of Control and their right of acceleration of the notes pursuant to Clause 16.1 of the Terms and Conditions.
B. Decision procedure
The Agent will determine if received replies are eligible to participate and calculate the result. When a requisite majority of consents of the Total Note Voting Amount have been received by the Agent the relevant decision shall be deemed to be adopted, even if the time period for replies in the written procedure has not yet expired. Information about the decision taken in the written procedure will be sent by notice to the Noteholders. A matter decided will be binding for all Noteholders whether or not they participate in the procedure.

Voting rights
Anyone who wishes to participate in the written procedure must on 21 November 2014 (the " Record D ate"):

(i)

be registered on the Securities Account as a direct registered owner

( direktregistrerad ägare); o r

(ii) be registered on the Securities Account as authorised nominee (förvaltare),

with respect to one or several Notes.

If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Notes are held through a registered authorised nominee (förvaltare) or another intermediary, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the Notes.

1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Notes on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.

2. You can obtain a power of attorney or other authorisation from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own voting form based on the authorisation. If you hold your Notes through several intermediaries, you need to obtain authorisation directly from the intermediary that is registered in the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of holders, starting with the intermediary that is registered in the Securities Account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.

Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Notes on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).

The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Notes on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the written procedure and do not know how your Notes are registered or need authorisation or other assistance to participate.

Notes owned by the Issuer or another member of the Group do not entitle to any voting rights.

M ajority and quorum
At least 67 per cent of the Total Note Voting Amount must consent to the Request in order for it to be approved.

Noteholders who do not reply before 5 p.m. on 18 December 2014 shall be deemed to have given their consent to the Request, pursuant to Clause 20.7(a) of the Terms and

CorpNordic
Conditions. There is therefore no minimum requirement of participation in order for the procedure to be validly held and be able to decide on the matter (quorum). Fin al date to vote in the written procedure The Agent must have received the votes by mail, courier or e-mail to the address indicated below no later than by 5 p.m. on 18 December 2014.
