A32526088

12

(b) Transfer
Bonds may, subject to the terms of the Agency Agreement and to Conditions 4(c) (Formalities Free of Charge) and 4(d) (Closed Period), be transferred by lodging the relevant Bond (with the form of application for transfer in respect thereof duly executed by the transferor and the transferee and duly stamped where applicable) at the specified office of the Registrar or any Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agent.
No transfer of a Bond will be valid unless and until entered on the Register. A Bond may be registered only in the name of, and transferred only to, a named person (or persons, not exceeding four in number).
The Registrar will within seven business days, in the place of the specified office of the Registrar, of any duly made application for the transfer of a Bond, register the relevant transfer in the register and deliver a new Bond to the transferee (and, in the case of a transfer of part only of a Bond, deliver a Bond for the untransferred balance to the transferor) at the specified office of the Registrar or (at the risk and, if mailed at the request of the transferee or, as the case may be, the transferor otherwise than by ordinary mail, at the expense of the transferee or, as the case may be, the transferor) mail the Bond by uninsured mail to such address as the transferee or, as the case may be, the transferor may request.
(c) Formalities Free of Charge
Such transfer will be effected without charge subject to (i) the person making such application for transfer paying or procuring the payment of any taxes, duties and other governmental charges in connection therewith, (ii) the Registrar being satisfied with the documents of title and/or identity of the person making the application and (iii) such reasonable regulations as the Issuer may from time to time agree with the Registrar and the Trustee (and as initially set out in the Agency Agreement).

5 Interest
(a) Interest Rate
The Bonds bear interest from (and including) the Closing Date at the rate of 2.75 per cent. per annum calculated by reference to the principal amount thereof and payable semi-annually in arrear in equal instalments on 6 October and 6 April in each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing with the Interest Payment Date falling on 6 April 2017.
The amount of interest payable in respect of any period which is shorter than an Interest Period shall be calculated on the basis of the number of days in the relevant period from (and including) the first day of such period to (but excluding) the last day of such period divided by the product of the number of days from (and including) the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date (or, if none, the Closing

A32526088

13

Date) to (but excluding) the next Interest Payment Date and the number of Interest Periods normally ending in any year.
"Interest Period" means the period beginning on (and including) the Closing Date and ending on (but excluding) the first Interest Payment Date and each successive period beginning on (and including) an Interest Payment Date and ending on (but excluding) the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.
(b) Accrual of Interest
Each Bond will cease to bear interest (i) where the Conversion Right shall have been exercised by a Bondholder, from (and including) the Interest Payment Date immediately preceding the relevant Conversion Date or, if none, the Closing Date (subject in any such case as provided in Condition 6(j)) (Interest on Conversion) or (ii) where such Bond is redeemed or repaid pursuant to Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase) or Condition 10 (Events of Default), from (and including) the due date for redemption or repayment thereof unless, upon due presentation thereof, payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused, in which event interest will continue to accrue at the rate specified in Condition 5(a) (Interest Rate) (both before and after judgment) up to, but excluding the Relevant Date.
6 Conversion of Bonds
(a) Conversion Period and Conversion Price
Subject to the provisions of these Conditions, each Bond shall entitle the holder to convert such Bond into new B Shares in the circumstances provided in these Conditions, credited as fully paid (a "Conversion Right").
The number of B Shares to be issued on exercise of a Conversion Right shall be determined by the Calculation Agent by dividing the principal amount of the Bonds to be converted by the conversion price (the "Conversion Price") in effect on the relevant Conversion Date.
The initial Conversion Price is SEK 181.9550 per B Share. The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment in the circumstances described in Condition 6(b) (Adjustment of Conversion Price).
A Bondholder may exercise a Conversion Right in respect of a Bond by delivering such Bond together with a duly completed Conversion Notice to the specified office of any Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agent in accordance with Condition 6(h) (Procedure for exercise of Conversion Rights) whereupon the Issuer shall (subject as provided in these Conditions) procure the delivery, to or as directed by the relevant Bondholder, of B Shares credited as paid up in full as provided in this Condition 6 (Conversion of Bonds).
Subject to and as provided in these Conditions, the Conversion Right in respect of a Bond may be exercised, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time subject to any applicable fiscal or other laws or regulations and as hereinafter provided from 15 November 2016 to the close of business (at the place where the relevant Bond is delivered for conversion) on the date falling ten calendar days prior to the Final Maturity Date (both days inclusive) or, if such Bond is to be redeemed pursuant to Condition 7(b) (Redemption at the Option of the Issuer) or 7(c) (Redemption for Taxation Reasons) prior to the Final Maturity Date, then up to (and including) the close of business (at the place aforesaid) on the tenth calendar day before the date fixed for redemption thereof pursuant to Condition 7(b) (Redemption at the Option of the Issuer) or 7(c) (Redemption for Taxation Reasons), unless there shall be a default in making payment in respect of such Bond on such date fixed for redemption, in which event the Conversion Right shall extend up to (and including) the close of business (at the place aforesaid) on the date on which the full amount of such payment becomes available for payment and

A32526088

14

notice of such availability has been duly given in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices) or, if earlier, the Final Maturity Date or, if the Final Maturity Date is not a Stockholm business day, the immediately preceding Stockholm business day; provided that, in each case, if such final date for the exercise of Conversion Rights is not a business day at the place aforesaid, then the period for exercise of Conversion Rights by Bondholders shall end on the immediately preceding business day at the place aforesaid.
Conversion Rights may not be exercised (i) following the giving of notice by the Trustee pursuant to Condition 10 (Events of Default) or (ii) in respect of a Bond in respect of which the relevant Bondholder has exercised its right to require the Issuer to redeem that Bond pursuant to Condition 7(e) (Redemption at the Option of Bondholders Upon a Change of Control or a Free Float Event).
Save in the circumstances described in Condition 6(j) in respect of any notice given by the Issuer pursuant to Condition 7(b) or 7(c), Conversion Rights may not be exercised by a Bondholder in circumstances where the relevant Conversion Date would fall during the period commencing on the Record Date in respect of any payment of interest on the Bonds and ending on the relevant Interest Payment Date (both days inclusive).
The period during which Conversion Rights may (subject as provided below) be exercised by a Bondholder is referred to as the "Conversion Period".
Conversion Rights may only be exercised by Bondholders in respect of the whole of the principal amount of a Bond.
Fractions of B Shares will not be issued or delivered on exercise of Conversion Rights and no cash payment or other adjustment will be made in lieu thereof. However, if the Conversion Right in respect of more than one Bond is exercised at any one time such that B Shares to be delivered on conversion are to be registered in the same name, the number of such B Shares to be delivered in respect thereof shall be calculated in good faith by the Calculation Agent on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of such Bonds being so converted and rounded down to the nearest whole number of B Shares.
The Issuer will procure that B Shares to be issued or delivered on exercise of Conversion Rights will be issued or delivered to the holder of the Bonds completing the relevant Conversion Notice or his nominee.
(b) Adjustment of Conversion Price
Upon the happening of any of the events described below, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by the Calculation Agent as follows:
(i) If and whenever there shall be a consolidation, reclassification or subdivision in relation to the B Shares, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such consolidation, reclassification or subdivision by the following fraction:

where: A
B

is the aggregate number of B Shares in issue immediately before such consolidation, reclassification or subdivision, as the case may be; and
is the aggregate number of B Shares in issue immediately after, and as a result of, such consolidation, reclassification or subdivision, as the case may be.

A32526088

15

Such adjustment shall become effective on the date the consolidation, reclassification or subdivision, as the case may be, takes effect.
(ii) If and whenever the Issuer shall issue any B Shares credited as fully paid to the B Shareholders by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves (including any share premium account or statutory reserve) other than where such capitalisation constitutes a Cash Dividend pursuant to paragraph (a) of the definition of "Dividend", the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such issue by the following fraction:

where:

A

is the aggregate number of B Shares in issue immediately before such issue; and

B

is the aggregate number of B Shares in issue immediately after such issue.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the date of issue of such B Shares.

(iii)

(A) If and whenever the Issuer shall pay or make any Capital Distribution to the B Shareholders, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to the Effective Date by the following fraction:

-

where:
A is the Current Market Price of one B Share on the Effective Date; and
B is the portion of the Fair Market Value of the aggregate Capital Distribution attributable to one B Share, with such portion being determined by dividing the Fair Market Value of the aggregate Capital Distribution attributable to the B Shares by the number of B Shares entitled to receive the relevant Capital Distribution (or, in the case of a purchase, redemption or buy back of B Shares or any depositary or other receipts or certificates representing B Shares by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer, by dividing the Fair Market Value of the aggregate Capital Distribution attributable to the B Shares by the number of B Shares, and treating as not being in issue any B Shares, or any B Shares represented by depositary or other receipts or certificates, purchased, redeemed or bought back).
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date or, if later, the first date upon which the Fair Market Value of the relevant Capital Distribution is capable of being determined as provided herein.
"Effective Date" means, in respect of this sub-paragraph (b)(iii)(A), the first date on which the B Shares are traded ex-the relevant Dividend on the Relevant Stock Exchange or, in the case of a purchase, redemption or buy back of B Shares or any depositary or other receipts or certificates representing B Shares, the date on which such purchase, redemption or buy back is made or in the case of a Spin-Off, the first date on which the B Shares are traded ex- the relevant Spin-Off on the Relevant Stock Exchange.

- - where:
A is the Current Market Price of one B Share on the Effective Date;
B is the portion of the Fair Market Value of the aggregate Extraordinary Dividend attributable to one B Share, with such portion being determined by dividing the Fair Market Value of the aggregate Extraordinary Dividend attributable to the B Shares by the number of B Shares entitled to receive the Relevant Dividend; and
C is the amount (if any) by which the Reference Amount determined in respect of the Relevant Dividend exceeds an amount equal to the aggregate of the Fair Market Values of any previous Cash Dividends per B Share the Ex-Date for which fell in the Relevant Fiscal Year (where C shall be zero if such previous Cash Dividends per B Share are equal to, or exceed, the Reference Amount in respect of the Relevant Fiscal Year). For the avoidance of doubt "C" shall equal the Reference Amount determined in respect of the Relevant Dividend where no previous Cash Dividends per B Share the Ex-Date for which fell in such Relevant Fiscal Year.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date or, if later, the first date upon which the Fair Market Value of the relevant Extraordinary Dividend can be determined.
"Effective Date" means, in respect of this sub-paragraph (b)(iii)(B), the first date on which the B Shares are traded ex-the relevant Dividend on the Relevant Stock Exchange.

(D) In making any calculations for the purposes of this Condition 6(b)(iii) (Adjustment of Conversion Price), such adjustments (if any) shall be made as the Calculation Agent or an Independent Financial Adviser may determine in good faith to be appropriate to reflect (i) any consolidation or sub-division of any B Shares or the issue of B Shares by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves (or any like or similar event) or any increase in the number of B Shares in issue in relation to the Relevant Fiscal Year, (ii) any change in the fiscal year of the Issuer, or (iii) any adjustment to the Conversion Price made in the Relevant Fiscal Year.
(iv)
(A) If and whenever the Issuer shall issue B Shares to B Shareholders as a class by way of rights, or shall issue or grant to B Shareholders as a class by way of rights, any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any B Shares, or any Securities which by their terms of issue carry (directly or indirectly) rights of conversion into, or exchange or subscription for any B Shares (or shall grant any such rights in respect of existing Securities so issued), at a price per B Share which is less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per B Share on the Effective Date, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to the Effective Date by the following fraction:
+ + where:
A is the number of B Shares in issue on the Effective Date;
B is the number of B Shares which the aggregate consideration (if any) receivable for the B Shares issued by way of rights, or for the Securities issued by way of rights, or for the options or warrants or other rights issued by way of rights and for the total number of B Shares deliverable on the exercise thereof, would purchase at such Current Market Price per B Share; and
C is the number of B Shares to be issued or, as the case may be, the maximum number of B Shares which may be issued upon exercise of such options, warrants or rights calculated as at the date of issue of such options, warrants or rights or upon conversion or exchange or exercise of rights of subscription or purchase in respect thereof at the initial conversion, exchange, subscription or purchase price or rate.

purposes of this sub-paragraph (b)(viii), "C" shall be determined by the application of such formula or variable feature or as if the relevant event occurs or had occurred as at the Specified Date and as if such conversion, exchange, subscription, purchase or acquisition had taken place on the Specified Date.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date.
"Effective Date" means, in respect of this sub-paragraph (b)(viii), the date of modification of the rights of conversion, exchange, subscription, purchase or acquisition attaching to such Securities.
(ix) If and whenever the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer or (at the direction or request of or pursuant to any arrangements with the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer) any other company, person or entity shall offer any Securities in connection with which B Shareholders as a class are entitled to participate in arrangements whereby such Securities may be acquired by them (except where the Conversion Price falls to be adjusted under subparagraphs (b)(ii), (b)(iii), (b)(iv), (b)(vi) or (b)(vii) above or (b)(x) below (or would fall to be so adjusted if the relevant issue or grant was at less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per B Share on the relevant dealing day) or under sub-paragraph (b)(v) above), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately before the Effective Date by the following fraction:
-

where:

A

is the Current Market Price of one B Share on the Effective Date; and

B

is the Fair Market Value on the Effective Date of the portion of the relevant offer

attributable to one B Share.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date.

"Effective Date" means, in respect of this sub-paragraph (b)(ix), the first date on which the B Shares are traded ex- rights on the Relevant Stock Exchange.

(x) If a Change of Control or a Free Float Event shall occur, then upon any exercise of Conversion Rights where the Conversion Date falls during the Change of Control Period or the Free Float Event Period, the Conversion Price applicable solely in respect to any such exercise of Conversion Rights (the "Change of Control Conversion Price" or the "Free Float Event Conversion Price" as the case may be) shall be determined as set out below:

COCCP = OCP/(1 + (CP x c/t)) where: "COCCP" means the Change of Control Conversion Price or the Free Float Event Conversion Price, as the case may be; "OCP" means the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control or the Free Float Event, as the case may be; "CP" means the Conversion Premium of 30 per cent. (expressed as fraction); "c" means the number of days from and including the date the Change of Control or the Free Float Event, as the case may be, occurs to but excluding the Final Maturity Date; and

A32526088

22

"t" means the number of days from and including the Conversion Date to but excluding the Final Maturity Date.
(xi) If the Issuer (after consultation with the Calculation Agent) determines in good faith that an adjustment should be made to the Conversion Price as a result of one or more circumstances not referred to above in this Condition 6(b) (Adjustment of Conversion Price) (even if the relevant circumstance is specifically excluded from the operation of sub-paragraphs (b)(i) to (x) above), the Issuer shall, at its own expense and acting reasonably, request an Independent Financial Adviser to determine in good faith in consultation with the Calculation Agent (if different) as soon as practicable what adjustment (if any) to the Conversion Price is fair and reasonable to take account thereof and the date on which such adjustment (if any) should take effect and upon such determination such adjustment (if any) shall be made and shall take effect in accordance with such determination, provided that an adjustment shall only be made pursuant to this subparagraph (b)(xi) if such Independent Financial Adviser is so requested to make such a determination not more than 21 calendar days after the date on which the relevant circumstance arises and if the adjustment would result in a reduction to the Conversion Price.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions:
(a) where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment pursuant to this Condition 6(b) (Adjustment of Conversion Price) have already resulted or will result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price or where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment arise by virtue of any other events or circumstances which have already given or will give rise to an adjustment to the Conversion Price or where more than one event which gives rise to an adjustment to the Conversion Price occurs within such a short period of time that, in the opinion of the Issuer following consultation with the Calculation Agent, a modification to the operation of the adjustment provisions is required to give the intended result, such modification shall be made to the operation of the adjustment provisions as may be advised in good faith by an Independent Financial Adviser to be in its opinion appropriate to give the intended result; and
(b) in addition, such modification shall be made to the operation of these Conditions as may be advised in good faith by an Independent Financial Adviser in consultation with the Calculation Agent (if different) to be in its opinion appropriate (i) to ensure that an adjustment to the Conversion Price or the economic effect thereof shall not be taken into account more than once and (ii) to ensure that the economic effect of a Dividend is not taken into account more than once.
For the purpose of any calculation of the consideration receivable or price pursuant to subparagraphs (b)(iv), (b)(vi), (b)(vii) and (b)(viii), the following provisions shall apply:
(a) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for B Shares issued for cash shall be the amount of such cash;
(b) (x) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for B Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the conversion or exchange of any Securities shall be deemed to be the consideration or price received or receivable for any such Securities and (y) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for B Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the exercise of rights of subscription attached to any Securities or upon the exercise of any options, warrants or rights shall be deemed to be that part (which may be the whole) of the consideration or price received or receivable for such Securities or, as the case may be, for such options, warrants or rights which are attributed by the Issuer to such rights of subscription or, as the case may be, such options, warrants or rights or, if no part of such consideration or price is

A32526088

23

so attributed, the Fair Market Value of such rights of subscription or, as the case may be, such options, warrants or rights as at the relevant date of first public announcement as referred to in sub-paragraphs (b)(vi), (b)(vii) or (b)(viii), as the case may be, plus in the case of each of (x) and (y) above, the additional minimum consideration receivable or price (if any) upon the conversion or exchange of such Securities, or upon the exercise of such rights of subscription attached thereto or, as the case may be, upon exercise of such options, warrants or rights and (z) the consideration receivable or price per B Share upon the conversion or exchange of, or upon the exercise of such rights of subscription attached to, such Securities or, as the case may be, upon the exercise of such options, warrants or rights shall be the aggregate consideration or price referred to in (x) or (y) above (as the case may be) divided by the number of B Shares as the case may be, to be issued upon such conversion or exchange or exercise at the initial conversion, exchange or subscription price or rate all as determined in good faith by the Calculation Agent;
(c) if the consideration or price determined pursuant to (a) or (b) above (or any component thereof) shall be expressed in a currency other than the Relevant Currency, it shall be converted by the Calculation Agent into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the relevant Effective Date (in the case of (a) above) or the relevant date of first public announcement (in the case of (b) above); and
(d) in determining the consideration or price pursuant to the above, no deduction shall be made for any commissions or fees (howsoever described) or any expenses paid or incurred for any underwriting, placing or management of the issue of the relevant B Shares or Securities or options, warrants or rights, or otherwise in connection therewith.
(c) Adjustment to Conversion Date
If the Registration Date (as defined in Condition 6(i) (B Shares)) in relation to any Bond would but for the provisions of this Condition 6(c) (Adjustment to Conversion Date) be after the record date in respect of any consolidation, reclassification or sub-division as is mentioned in Condition 6(b)(i) (Adjustment of Conversion Price), or after the record date or other due date for the establishment of entitlement for any such issue, distribution, grant or offer (as the case may be) as is mentioned in Condition 6(b)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v) (Adjustment of Conversion Price) or (ix), or after the date of the first public announcement of the terms of any such issue or grant as is mentioned in Condition 6(b)(vi) and (vii) (Adjustment of Conversion Price) or of the terms of any such modification as is mentioned in Condition 6(b)(viii), in circumstances where the Conversion Date falls before the relevant adjustment to the Conversion Price becomes effective under Condition 6(b) (Adjustment of Conversion Price), then references in these Conditions to the Conversion Date shall (save for the purposes of Conditions 5(b) (Accrual of Interest), 6(b)(x) (Adjustment of Conversion Price), 6(i) (B Shares) and 6(j) (Interest on Conversion) (and related definitions and provisions)), be deemed for all purposes to be a reference to the date such adjustment becomes effective, and, the Issuer shall take all necessary steps to cancel the original application for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and to procure the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office of the B Shares to be issued as soon as practicable following the Conversion Date (determined as aforesaid).
(d) Decision of the Calculation Agent or an Independent Financial Adviser
Adjustments to the Conversion Price shall be determined and calculated in good faith by the Calculation Agent upon request from the Issuer, and/or, to the extent so specified in the Conditions, in good faith by an Independent Financial Adviser. Adjustments to the Conversion Price calculated by the Calculation Agent or, where applicable, an Independent Financial Adviser and any other

A32526088

24

determinations made by the Calculation Agent or, where applicable, an Independent Financial Adviser, or an opinion of an Independent Financial Adviser, pursuant to these Conditions shall in each case be made in good faith and shall be final and binding (in the absence of manifest error) on the Issuer, the Trustee, the Bondholders, the Calculation Agent (in the case of a determination by an Independent Financial Adviser) and the Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agents. The Calculation Agent may consult, at the expense of the Issuer, on any matter (including, but not limited to, any legal matter), any legal or other professional adviser and it shall be able to rely upon, and it shall not be liable and shall incur no liability as against the Trustee, the Bondholders or the Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agents in respect of anything done, or omitted to be done, relating to that matter in good faith, in accordance with that adviser's opinion.
The Calculation Agent (and any Independent Financial Adviser appointed in accordance with these Conditions) shall act solely upon the request from, and exclusively as agent of, the Issuer and in accordance with these Conditions. Neither the Calculation Agent (acting in such capacity) nor any Independent Financial Adviser appointed in connection with the Bonds (acting in such capacity) will thereby assume any obligations towards or relationship of agency or trust and shall not be liable and shall incur no liability in respect of anything done, or omitted to be done in good faith, in accordance with the Conditions as against the Trustee, the Bondholders or the Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agents.
If following consultation between the Issuer and the Calculation Agent any doubt shall arise as to whether an adjustment falls to be made to the Conversion Price or as to the appropriate adjustment to the Conversion Price, and following consultation between the Issuer and an Independent Financial Adviser, a written opinion of such Independent Financial Adviser in respect thereof shall be conclusive and binding on the Issuer, the Bondholders, the Calculation Agent and the Trustee.
(e) Share or Option Schemes
No adjustment will be made to the Conversion Price where B Shares or other Securities (including rights, warrants and options) are issued, offered, exercised, allotted, appropriated, modified or granted to, or for the benefit of, employees or former employees (including directors holding or formerly holding executive office or the personal service company of any such person) or their spouses or relatives, in each case, of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any associated company or to a trustee or trustees to be held for the benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to any share or option scheme.
(f) Rounding Down and Notice of Adjustment to the Conversion Price
On any adjustment, the resultant Conversion Price, if not an integral multiple of SEK 0.01, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of SEK 0.01. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price where such adjustment (rounded down if applicable) would be less than one per cent. of the Conversion Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made and/or any amount by which the Conversion Price has been rounded down, shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and such subsequent adjustment shall be made on the basis that the adjustment not required to be made had been made at the relevant time and/or, as the case may be, that the relevant rounding down had not been made.
Notice of any adjustments to the Conversion Price shall be given by the Issuer to Bondholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices) and to the Trustee promptly after the determination thereof.
The Conversion Price shall not in any event be reduced to below the nominal value of the B Shares and the Issuer undertakes that it shall not take any action, and shall procure that no action is taken, that

A32526088

25

would otherwise result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price to below such nominal value or any minimum level permitted by applicable laws or regulations.
(g) Change of Control or Free Float Event
(i) Within 7 calendar days following the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Issuer shall give notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Bondholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices) (a "Change of Control Notice"). The Change of Control Notice shall contain a statement informing Bondholders of their entitlement to exercise their Conversion Rights as provided in these Conditions and their entitlement to exercise their rights to require redemption of their Bonds pursuant to Condition 7(e) (Redemption at the Option of Bondholders Upon a Change of Control or a Free Float Event).
The Change of Control Notice shall also specify:
(A) all information material to Bondholders concerning the Change of Control;
(B) the Conversion Price immediately prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control and the Change of Control Conversion Price applicable pursuant to Condition 6(b)(x) (Adjustment of Conversion Price) during the Change of Control Period on the basis of the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control;
(C) the closing price of the B Shares as derived from the Relevant Stock Exchange as at the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Change of Control Notice;
(D) the last day of the Change of Control Period;
(E) the Put Date; and
(F) such other information relating to the Change of Control as the Trustee may require.
(ii) Upon the occurrence of a Free Float Event, the Issuer shall give notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Bondholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices) (a "Free Float Event Notice"). Such notice shall contain a statement informing Bondholders of their entitlement to exercise their rights of redemption under Condition 7(e).
The Free Float Event Notice shall also specify:
(A) all information material to Bondholders concerning the Free Float Event;
(B) the Conversion Price immediately prior to the occurrence of the Free Float Event and the Free Float Event Conversion Price applicable pursuant to Condition 6(b)(x) during the Free Float Event Period on the basis of the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the occurrence of the Free Float Event;
(C) the closing price of the B Shares as derived from the Relevant Stock Exchange as at the latest practicable date prior to the occurrence of the Free Float Event;
(D) the Put Date; and
(E) such other information relating to the Free Float Event as the Trustee may require.
The Trustee shall not be required to monitor or take any steps to ascertain whether a Change of Control or a Free Float Event or any event which could lead to a Change of Control or Free Float Event has

A32526088

26

occurred or may occur and will not be responsible or liable to Bondholders or any other person for any loss arising from any failure by it to do so.
(h) Procedure for exercise of Conversion Rights
Conversion Rights may be exercised by a Bondholder during the Conversion Period by delivering the relevant Bond to the specified office of any Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agent, during its usual business hours, accompanied by a duly completed and signed notice of conversion (a "Conversion Notice") in the form (for the time being current) obtainable from any Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agent. Conversion Rights shall be exercised subject in each case to any applicable fiscal or other laws or regulations applicable in the jurisdiction in which the specified office of the Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agent to whom the relevant Conversion Notice is delivered is located.
If such delivery is made after the end of normal business hours or on a day which is not a business day in the place of the specified office of the relevant Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agent, such delivery shall be deemed for all purposes of these Conditions to have been made on the next following such business day.
Any determination as to whether any Conversion Notice has been duly completed and properly delivered shall be made by the relevant Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agent and shall, save in the case of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agents and the relevant Bondholder.
Conversion Rights may only be exercised in respect of the whole of the principal amount of a Bond. Where Conversion Rights are exercised in respect of part only of a Bond, the old Bond shall be cancelled and a new Bond for the balance thereof shall be issued in lieu thereof without charge but upon payment by the holder of any taxes, duties and other governmental charges payable in connection therewith and the Registrar will within seven business days, in the place of the specified office of the Registrar, following the relevant Conversion Date deliver such new Bond to the Bondholder at the specified office of the Registrar or (at the risk and, if mailed at the request of the Bondholder otherwise than by ordinary mail, at the expense of the Bondholder) mail the new Bond by uninsured mail to such address as the Bondholder may request.
A Conversion Notice, once delivered, shall be irrevocable.
The conversion date in respect of a Bond (the "Conversion Date") shall be the day which is both a business day in Stockholm and a dealing day immediately following the date of the delivery of the relevant Bond and the Conversion Notice as provided in this Condition 6(h) (Procedure for exercise of Conversion Rights).
A Bondholder exercising Conversion Rights must pay directly to the relevant authorities any taxes and capital, stamp, issue and registration and transfer taxes and duties arising on such exercise (other than any taxes or capital, stamp, issue and registration and transfer taxes and duties payable in the Kingdom of Sweden in respect of the issue or transfer and delivery of any B Shares in respect of such exercise, which shall be paid by the Issuer). If the Issuer shall fail to pay any taxes and capital, stamp, issue and registration and transfer taxes and duties payable for which it is responsible as provided above, the relevant holder shall be entitled to tender and pay the same and the Issuer as a separate and independent stipulation, covenants to reimburse and indemnify each Bondholder in respect of any payment thereof and any penalties payable in respect thereof.

A32526088

27

Such Bondholder must also pay all, if any, taxes imposed on it and arising by reference to any disposal or deemed disposal of a Bond or interest therein in connection with the exercise of Conversion Rights by it.
The Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring or determining whether such taxes or capital, stamp, issue and registration and transfer taxes and duties are payable or the amount thereof and it shall not be responsible or liable to any person for any failure by the Issuer to pay such taxes or capital, stamp, issue and registration and transfer taxes and duties.
(i) B Shares
The person or persons specified for such purpose in the relevant Conversion Notice will become the holder of record of the number of B Shares issuable upon conversion with effect from the date such person or persons is/are registered in the Issuer's share register through registration in the share accounts maintained with Euroclear (the "Registration Date"). Registration in the share register maintained with Euroclear will occur following registration of such B Shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The B Shares issued and registered upon conversion of the Bonds will be fully-paid, and will in all respects rank pari passu with the B Shares in issue on the relevant Registration Date except that such B Shares will not rank for any dividend or other distribution declared, paid or made by reference to a record date or other due date for establishment of entitlement prior to such Registration Date.
Prior to the Registration Date, such B Shares will be registered in the Issuer's share register on an interim basis in accordance with the Rules and will entitle holders to exercise voting rights.
If the record date or other due date for establishment of entitlement for the payment of any dividend or other distribution in respect of the B Shares to be issued on conversion of the Bonds is on or after the Conversion Date in respect of any Bond but before the Registration Date (other than and to the extent that it results in an adjustment (retroactive or otherwise) to the number of B Shares to which a converting Bondholder is entitled under Condition 6(b) (Adjustment of Conversion Price)), the Issuer will pay to the Bondholder who has exercised his Conversion Right in lieu of such dividend or distribution an amount (the "Equivalent Amount") equal to any such dividend or other distribution to which such Bondholder would have been entitled had he on that record date or other due date for establishment of entitlement been such a shareholder of record of such B Shares on that date, translated if not in Swedish Krona into Swedish Krona at the Prevailing Rate on the date the relevant dividend or distribution is paid or made and will make the relevant payment to the relevant Bondholder at the same time that it makes payment of the dividend or other distribution. The Equivalent Amount shall be paid in Swedish Krona in accordance with instructions given by the relevant Bondholder in the relevant Conversion Notice.
Save as provided in Condition 6(j) (Interest on Conversion), no payment or adjustment shall be made on exercise of Conversion Rights for any interest which otherwise would have accrued on the relevant Bonds since the last Interest Payment Date preceding the Conversion Date relating to such Bonds (or, if such Conversion Date falls before the first Interest Payment Date, since the Closing Date).
(j) Interest on Conversion
If any notice requiring the redemption of the Bonds is given pursuant to Condition 7(b) (Redemption at the Option of the Issuer) or Condition 7(c) (Redemption for Taxation Reasons) on or after the fifteenth Stockholm business day prior to a record date which has occurred since the last Interest Payment Date (or in the case of the first Interest Period, since the Closing Date) in respect of any Dividend or distribution payable in respect of the B Shares where such notice specifies a date for redemption

A32526088

28

falling on or prior to the date which is 14 calendar days after the Interest Payment Date next following such record date, interest shall accrue at the rate provided in Condition 5(a) (Interest Rate) on Bonds in respect of which Conversion Rights shall have been exercised and in respect of which the Conversion Date and/or the Registration Date falls after such record date and the Conversion Date falls on or prior to the Interest Payment Date next following such record date in respect of such Dividend or distribution, in each case from and including the preceding Interest Payment Date (or, if such Conversion Date falls before the first Interest Payment Date, from the Closing Date) to but excluding such Conversion Date. The Issuer shall pay any such interest by not later than 14 calendar days after the relevant Conversion Date by transfer to a Swedish Krona account with a bank in Stockholm in accordance with instructions given by the relevant Bondholder in the relevant Conversion Notice.
(k) Purchase or Redemption of B Shares
The Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer may exercise such rights as it may from time to time enjoy to purchase or redeem or buy back any shares of the Issuer (including B Shares) or any depositary or other receipts or certificates representing the same without the consent of the Bondholders.
(l) No Duty to Monitor
Neither the Trustee nor the Calculation Agent shall be under any duty to monitor whether any event or circumstance has happened or exists or may happen or exist and which requires or may require an adjustment to be made to the Conversion Price and will not be responsible or liable to any person for any loss arising from any failure by it to do so, nor shall the Trustee or the Calculation Agent be responsible or liable to any person (other than in the case of the Calculation Agent, to the Issuer strictly in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Calculation Agency Agreement) for any determination of whether or not an adjustment to the Conversion Price is required or should be made nor as to the determination or calculation of any such adjustment.
(m) Consolidation, Amalgamation or Merger.
In the case of any consolidation, amalgamation or merger of the Issuer with any other corporation (other than a consolidation, amalgamation or merger in which the Issuer is the continuing corporation), or in the case of any sale or transfer of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Issuer, the Issuer will forthwith give notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Bondholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices) of such event and take such steps as shall be required by the Trustee (but without requiring the consent of Bondholders) (including the execution of a deed supplemental to or amending the Trust Deed) to ensure that each Bond then outstanding will (during the period in which Conversion Rights may be exercised) be convertible into the class and amount of shares and other securities and property receivable upon such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of B Shares which would have become liable to be issued upon exercise of Conversion Rights immediately prior to such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer. The above provisions of this Condition 6(m) (Consolidation, Amalgamation or Merger) will apply, mutatis mutandis to any subsequent consolidations, amalgamations, mergers, sales or transfers.
7 Redemption and Purchase
(a) Final Redemption
Unless previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted as herein provided, the Bonds will be redeemed at their principal amount on the Final Maturity Date. The Bonds may only be redeemed at the option of the Issuer prior to the Final Maturity Date in accordance with Condition 7(b) (Redemption at the Option of the Issuer) or 7(c) (Redemption for Taxation Reasons).

A32526088

29

(b) Redemption at the Option of the Issuer
On giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 calendar days' notice (an "Optional Redemption Notice") to the Trustee and to the Bondholders in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices), the Issuer may redeem all but not some only of the Bonds on the date (the "Optional Redemption Date") specified in the Optional Redemption Notice at their principal amount, together with accrued but unpaid interest to such date:
(A) at any time on or after 25 October 2019 (the "First Call Date") if on each of not less than 20 dealing days in any period of 30 consecutive dealing days ending not earlier than 14 calendar days prior to the giving of the relevant Optional Redemption Notice, the Volume Weighted Average Price of a B Share for such dealing day is equal to or exceeds 130 per cent. of the Conversion Price (as adjusted) in effect or deemed to be in effect on such dealing day, as verified by the Calculation Agent upon request by the Issuer; or
(B) at any time if, prior to the date the relevant Optional Redemption Notice is given, Conversion Rights shall have been exercised and/or purchases (and corresponding cancellations) and/or redemptions effected in respect of 85 per cent. or more in principal amount of the Bonds originally issued (which shall for this purpose include any Further Bonds).
(c) Redemption for Taxation Reasons
At any time the Issuer may, having given not less than 45 nor more than 60 calendar days' notice (a "Tax Redemption Notice") to the Bondholders redeem (subject to the second following paragraph) all but not some only of the Bonds for the time being outstanding on the date (the "Tax Redemption Date") specified in the Tax Redemption Notice at their principal amount, together with accrued but unpaid interest to such date, if the Issuer satisfies the Trustee immediately prior to the giving of such notice that (i) the Issuer has or will become obliged to pay additional amounts in respect of payments of interest on the Bonds pursuant to Condition 9 (Taxation) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of the Kingdom of Sweden or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, or any change in the general application or official interpretation of such laws or regulations, which change or amendment becomes effective on or after 29 September 2016, and (ii) such obligation cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it, provided that no Tax Redemption Notice shall be given earlier than 90 calendar days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer would be obliged to pay such additional amounts were a payment in respect of the Bonds then due. Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this paragraph, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee (a) a certificate signed by two directors of the Issuer stating that the obligation referred to in (i) above has arisen and cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of independent legal or tax advisers of recognised international standing to the effect that such change or amendment has occurred and that the Issuer has or will be obliged to pay such additional amounts as a result thereof (irrespective of whether such amendment or change is then effective) and the Trustee shall accept without any liability for so doing such certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the matters set out in (i) and (ii) above in which event it shall be conclusive and binding on the Bondholders.
On the Tax Redemption Date the Issuer shall (subject to the next following paragraph) redeem the Bonds at their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest to such date.

A32526088

30

If the Issuer gives a Tax Redemption Notice, each Bondholder will have the right to elect that its Bonds shall not be redeemed and that the provisions of Condition 9 (Taxation) requiring the Issuer to pay additional amounts shall not apply in respect of any payment of interest to be made on such Bonds which falls due after the relevant Tax Redemption Date, whereupon no additional amounts shall be payable in respect thereof pursuant to Condition 9 (Taxation) and payment of all amounts of such interest on such Bonds shall be made subject to the deduction or withholding of any Swedish taxation required to be withheld or deducted. To exercise such right, the holder of the relevant Bond must complete, sign and deposit at the specified office of any Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agent a duly completed and signed notice of election, in the form for the time being current, obtainable from the specified office of any Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agent together with the relevant Bonds on or before the day falling 10 calendar days prior to the Tax Redemption Date.
(d) Optional Redemption and Tax Redemption Notices
The Issuer shall not give an Optional Redemption Notice or Tax Redemption Notice at any time during a Change of Control Period or an Offer Period or which specifies a date for a redemption falling in a Change of Control Period or an Offer Period or the period of 21 days following the end of a Change of Control Period or Offer Period (whether or not the relevant notice was given prior to or during such Change of Control Period or Offer Period), and any such notice shall be invalid and of no effect (whether or not given prior to the relevant Change of Control Period or Offer Period) and the relevant redemption shall not be made.
Any Optional Redemption Notice or Tax Redemption Notice shall be irrevocable. Any such notice shall specify (i) the Optional Redemption Date or, as the case may be, the Tax Redemption Date, which shall be a Stockholm business day, (ii) the Conversion Price, the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds outstanding and the closing price of the B Shares as derived from the Relevant Stock Exchange, in each case as at the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Optional Redemption Notice or, as the case may be, the Tax Redemption Notice and (iii) the last day on which Conversion Rights may be exercised by Bondholders.
"Offer Period" means (i) any period commencing on the date of first public announcement of an offer or tender (howsoever described) by any person or persons in respect of all or a majority of the issued and outstanding B Shares and ending on the date that offer ceases to be open for acceptance or, if earlier, on which that offer lapses or terminates or (ii) any period commencing on the date of first public announcement of a Scheme of Arrangement relating to the acquisition of all or a majority of the issued and outstanding B Shares and ending on the date such Scheme of Arrangement is or becomes effective or, if earlier, the date such Scheme of Arrangement is cancelled or terminated.
(e) Redemption at the Option of Bondholders Upon a Change of Control or a Free Float Event
Following the occurrence of a Change of Control or a Free Float Event, the holder of each Bond will have the right to require the Issuer to redeem that Bond on the relevant Put Date at its principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest to such date.
To exercise such right, the holder of the relevant Bond must deliver such Bond to the specified office of any Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agent, together with a duly completed and signed notice of exercise in the form for the time being current obtainable from the specified office of any Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agent (a "Put Exercise Notice"), at any time during the Change of Control Period or the Free Float Event Period. The "Put Date" shall be the fourteenth Stockholm business day after the expiry of the Change of Control Period or, as the case may be, the Free Float Event Period.

A32526088

31

Payment in respect of any such Bond shall be made by transfer to a Swedish Krona account with a bank in Stockholm as specified by the relevant Bondholder in the relevant Put Exercise Notice.
A Put Exercise Notice, once delivered, shall be irrevocable and the Issuer shall redeem all Bonds the subject of Put Exercise Notices delivered as aforesaid on the Put Date.
(f) Purchase
Subject to the requirements (if any) of any stock exchange on which the Bonds may be admitted to listing and trading at the relevant time and subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer may at any time purchase any Bonds in the open market or otherwise at any price. Any Bonds purchased by a Subsidiary of the Issuer may be held, re-sold or reissued or, at the option of the relevant purchaser, surrendered to any Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agent for cancellation. The Bonds so purchased, while held by or on behalf of the Issuer or by or on behalf of any Subsidiary, shall not entitle the holder to vote at any meeting of the Bondholders, or otherwise to exercise any voting rights and shall not be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of calculating quorums at meetings or for voting on any Extraordinary Resolution or for the purposes of Condition 14(a).
(g) Cancellation
All Bonds which are redeemed or in respect of which Conversion Rights are exercised will be cancelled and may not be reissued or resold. Bonds purchased by the Issuer shall be surrendered to the Principal Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agent for cancellation and may not be reissued or re-sold.
(h) Multiple Notices
If more than one notice of redemption is given pursuant to this Condition 7 (Redemption and Purchase), the first of such notices to be given shall prevail.

All payments made by on or behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Bonds will be made free from any restriction or condition and be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Kingdom of Sweden or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, unless deduction or withholding of such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges is required to be made by law.
In the event that any such withholding or deduction is required to be made, the Issuer will pay such additional amounts as will result in the receipt by the Bondholders of the amounts which would otherwise have been receivable had no such withholding or deduction been required, except that no such additional amount shall be payable in respect of interest on any Bond to a holder (or to a third party on behalf of a holder) who is subject to such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges in respect of such Bond by reason of his having some connection with the Kingdom of Sweden otherwise than merely by holding the Bond or by the receipt of amounts in respect of the Bond.
References in these Conditions to principal and/or interest and/or any other amounts payable in respect of the Bonds shall be deemed also to refer to any additional amounts which may be payable under this Condition or any undertaking or covenant given in addition thereto or in substitution therefor pursuant to the Trust Deed.

(iii)
(a) any other present or future indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Material Subsidiaries for or in respect of moneys borrowed or raised becomes due and payable prior to its stated maturity by reason of any actual or potential default, event of default or the like (howsoever described); or

(iv) a distress, attachment, execution or other legal process is levied, enforced or sued out on or against the whole or, in the opinion of the Trustee, any substantial part of the property, assets or revenues of the Issuer or any of its Material Subsidiaries and is not discharged or stayed within 30 calendar days; or
(v) any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien or other encumbrance, present or future, created or assumed by the Issuer or any of its Material Subsidiaries becomes enforceable and any step is taken to enforce it (including the taking of possession or the appointment of a receiver, administrative receiver, administrator manager or other similar person); or
(vi) the Issuer or any of its Material Subsidiaries is (or is deemed by law or a court to be) insolvent or bankrupt or unable to pay its debts, stops, suspends or publicly announces its intention to stop or suspend payment of all or, in the opinion of the Trustee, a material part of (or of a particular type of) its debts, proposes or makes any agreement for the deferral, rescheduling or other readjustment of all of (or all of a particular type of) its debts (or of any substantial part which it will otherwise be unable to pay when due), proposes or makes a general assignment or an arrangement or composition with or for the benefit of the relevant creditors in respect of any of such debts or a moratorium is agreed or declared or comes into effect in respect of or affecting all or, in the opinion of the Trustee, any substantial part of (or of a particular type of) the debts of the Issuer or any of its Material Subsidiaries; or
(vii) an administrator is appointed, an order is made or an effective resolution passed for the winding-up or dissolution or administration of the Issuer or any of its Material Subsidiaries, or the Issuer ceases or publicly announces its intention to cease to carry on all or substantially all of its business or operations, except (i) for the purpose of and followed by a reconstruction, amalgamation, reorganisation, merger or consolidation on terms approved by the Trustee or by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Bondholders, or (ii) in the case of a Material Subsidiary, whereby the undertaking and assets of the Material Subsidiary are transferred to or otherwise vested in the Issuer or another of its Subsidiaries; or
(viii) any event occurs which under the laws of any relevant jurisdiction has an analogous effect to any of the events referred to in any of the foregoing paragraphs,

11 Undertakings
Whilst any Conversion Right remains exercisable, the Issuer will, save with the approval of an Extraordinary Resolution or with the prior written approval of the Trustee where, in its opinion, it is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Bondholders to give such approval:

A32526088

35

(a) other than in connection with a Newco Scheme, not issue or pay up any Securities, in either case by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves, other than:
(i) by the issue of fully paid B Shares or other Securities to B Shareholders and other holders of shares in the capital of the Issuer which by their terms entitle the holders thereof to receive other shares or Securities on a capitalisation of profits or reserves; or
(ii) by the issue of B Shares paid up in full (in accordance with applicable law) and issued wholly, ignoring fractional entitlements, in lieu of the whole or part of a Dividend in cash; or
(iii) by the issue of fully paid equity share capital (other than B Shares) to the holders of equity share capital of the same class and other holders of shares in the capital of the Issuer which by their terms entitle the holders thereof to receive equity share capital (other than B Shares); or
(iv) by the issue of B Shares or any equity share capital to, or for the benefit of, any employee or former employee, director or executive holding or formerly holding executive office of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any associated company or to trustees or nominees to be held for the benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to an employee, director or executive share or option scheme whether for all employees, directors, or executives or any one or more of them,
unless, in any such case, the same constitutes a Dividend or otherwise gives rise (or would, but for the provisions of Condition 6(f) (Rounding Down and Notice of Adjustment to the Conversion Price) relating to roundings or the carry forward of adjustments, give rise) to an adjustment to the Conversion Price;
(b) not modify the rights attaching to the B Shares with respect to voting, dividends or liquidation nor issue any other class of equity share capital carrying any rights which are more favourable than the rights attaching to the B Shares but so that nothing in this Condition 11(b) (Undertakings) shall prevent:
(i) any consolidation, reclassification or subdivision of the B Shares; or
(ii) any modification of such rights which is not, in the determination in good faith of an Independent Financial Adviser, materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the Bonds upon which determination the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely; or
(iii) any alteration to the articles of association of the Issuer made in connection with the matters described in this Condition 11 (Undertakings) or which is supplemental to or incidental to any of the foregoing (including any amendment made to enable or facilitate procedures relating to such matters and any amendment dealing with the rights and obligations of holders of Securities, including B Shares, dealt with under such procedures); or
(iv) any issue of equity share capital where the issue of such equity share capital results, or would, but for the provisions of Condition 6(f) (Rounding Down and Notice of Adjustment to the Conversion Price) relating to roundings or the carry forward of adjustments or, where comprising B Shares, the fact that the consideration per B Share receivable therefor is at least 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per B Share on the relevant date, otherwise result, in an adjustment to the Conversion Price; or
(v) any issue of equity share capital or modification of rights attaching to the B Shares, where prior thereto the Issuer shall have instructed an Independent Financial Adviser to determine in good faith what (if any) adjustments should be made to the Conversion Price as being fair and reasonable to take account thereof and such Independent Financial Adviser shall have

A32526088

36

determined either that no adjustment is required or that an adjustment resulting in a decrease in the Conversion Price is required and, if so, the new Conversion Price as a result thereof and the basis upon which such adjustment is to be made and, in any such case, the date on which the adjustment shall take effect (and so that the adjustment shall be made and shall take effect accordingly);
(c) procure that no Securities (whether issued by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer or procured by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer to be issued or issued by any other person pursuant to any arrangement with the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer) issued without rights to convert into, or exchange or subscribe for, B Shares shall subsequently be granted such rights exercisable at a consideration per B Share which is less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per B Share or, at a consideration per B Share which is less than 95 per cent. of the Fair Market Value per B Share at the close of business on the last dealing day preceding the date of the first public announcement of the proposed inclusion of such rights unless the same gives rise (or would, but for the provisions of Condition 6(f) (Rounding down and Notice of Adjustment to the Conversion Price) relating to roundings or the carry forward of adjustments, give rise) to an adjustment to the Conversion Price and that at no time shall there be in issue B Shares of differing nominal values, save where such B Shares have the same economic rights;
(d) not make any issue, grant or distribution or take or omit to take any other action if the effect thereof would be that, on the exercise of Conversion Rights, B Shares could not, under any applicable law then in effect, be legally issued as fully paid;
(e) not reduce its issued share capital, statutory reserve, or any uncalled liability in respect thereof, or any non-distributable reserves, except:
(i) pursuant to the terms of issue of the relevant share capital; or
(ii) by means of a purchase or redemption of share capital of the Issuer to the extent, in any such case, permitted by applicable law; or
(iii) as permitted by the Swedish Companies Act, Chapter 20, Section 35, sub-sections 1 and 2;
(iv) where the reduction does not involve any distribution of assets; or
(v) to create distributable reserves (to which, in respect of any such creation of distributable reserves by the Issuer, the Trustee will be deemed (without requiring any action on its part) to have irrevocably given its consent (without any liability to any person for so doing) prior to such creation of distributable reserves occurring and, to the extent that express consent is required, the Bondholders authorise and direct the Trustee to give its consent (without any liability to any person for so doing) to such creation of distributable reserves); or
(vi) pursuant to a Newco Scheme; or
(vii) by way of transfer to reserves as permitted under applicable law; or
(viii) where the reduction is permitted by applicable law and the Trustee is advised in writing by an Independent Financial Adviser (and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such advice without liability to any person), acting as an expert and in good faith, that the interests of the Bondholders will not be materially prejudiced by such reduction; or
(ix) where the reduction is permitted by applicable law and results in (or would, but for the provisions of Condition 6(f) (Rounding Down and Notice of Adjustment to the Conversion Price) relating to roundings or the carry forward of adjustments, result in) an adjustment to the

A32526088

37

Conversion Price or is otherwise taken into account for the purposes of determining whether such an adjustment should be made,
provided that, without prejudice to the other provisions of these Conditions, the Issuer may exercise such rights as it may from time to time be entitled pursuant to applicable law to purchase, redeem or buy back its B Shares and any depositary or other receipts or certificates representing B Shares without the consent of Bondholders;
(f) if any offer (other than a Newco Offer) is made to all (or as nearly as may be practicable all) B Shareholders (or all (or as nearly as may be practicable all) such B Shareholders other than the offeror and/or any associates of the offeror) to acquire all or a majority of the issued B Shares, or if a scheme is proposed with regard to such acquisition (other than a Newco Scheme), give notice of such offer or scheme to the Trustee and the Bondholders at the same time as any notice thereof is sent to the B Shareholders (or as soon as practicable thereafter) that details concerning such offer or scheme may be obtained from the specified offices of the Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agents and, where such an offer or scheme has been recommended by the board of directors of the Issuer, or where such an offer has become or been declared unconditional in all respects or such scheme has become effective, use all reasonable endeavours to procure that a like offer or scheme is extended to the holders of any B Shares issued during the period of the offer or scheme arising out of the exercise of the Conversion Rights by the Bondholders and/or to the holders of the Bonds;
(g) in the event of a Newco Scheme, take (or shall procure that there is taken) all necessary action to ensure that (to the satisfaction of the Trustee) immediately after completion of the Scheme of Arrangement or Newco Offer, as the case may be, (I) in the case of a Scheme of Arrangement, at its option, either (a) Newco is substituted under the Bonds and the Trust Deed as principal obligor in place of the Issuer (with the Issuer providing a guarantee) subject to and as provided in the Trust Deed; or (b) Newco becomes a guarantor under the Bonds and the Trust Deed and, in either case, that such amendments are made to these Conditions and the Trust Deed as are necessary, in the opinion of the Trustee, to ensure that the Bonds may be converted into or exchanged for ordinary shares in Newco (or depositary or other receipts or certificates representing ordinary shares of Newco) mutatis mutandis in accordance with and subject to these Conditions and the Trust Deed and (II) in the case of a Newco Offer, the Bondholders receive bonds issued by Newco having in all material respects the same terms and conditions as the Bonds, and in the case of (I) or (II) above, the ordinary shares of Newco are:
(A) admitted to the Relevant Exchange; or
(B) admitted to listing on another regulated, regularly operating, recognised stock exchange or securities market.
(h) use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the B Shares issued upon exercise of Conversion Rights will, as soon as is practicable, be admitted to listing and to trading on the Relevant Stock Exchange and will be listed, quoted or accepted for dealing, as soon as is practicable, on any other stock exchange or securities market on which the B Shares may then be listed or quoted or accepted for dealing;
(i) for so long as any Bond remains outstanding, use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that its issued and outstanding B Shares shall be admitted to listing on the Relevant Stock Exchange;
(j) ensure that all necessary steps are taken for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office of the B Shares to be issued on conversion as soon as practicable following the relevant Conversion Date, and that on the Stockholm business day immediately following such registration the Issuer will register or procure that there is registered in the Issuer's share register through registration

A32526088

38

in the share accounts maintained with Euroclear the person or persons designated for the purpose in the relevant Conversion Notice as the holder or holders of the relevant number of B Shares and pending such registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office will procure that such B Shares are registered on an interim basis in the Issuer's share register through registration in the share accounts maintained with Euroclear as soon as practicable following the relevant Conversion Date;
(k) not make any issue or amend the Articles of Association (or other relevant constitutive documents) of the Issuer or take any other action if the effect of so doing would be that the Conversion Rights in respect of all Bonds outstanding from time to time could no longer be satisfied in full;
(l) at all times keep available for issue, free from pre-emptive rights out of its authorised but unissued capital, sufficient authorised but unissued B Shares to enable the exercise of a Conversion Rights, and all rights of subscription and exchange for B Shares, to be satisfied in full;
(m) for so long as any Bond remains outstanding use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that (i) the number of votes which shall be cast in respect of an A Share or a D Share shall not be increased and in respect of a B Share shall not be decreased and (ii) no issue or grant of any right, benefit or entitlements (including the making of any Dividend) is made or conferred in respect of the A Shares or D Shares unless an issue or grant, mutatis mutandis, shall be made in respect of the B Shares; and
(n) use all reasonable endeavours to make or cause to be made an application for the Bonds to be admitted to trading on the Open Market (Freiverkehr) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (or another internationally recognised, regularly operating, regulated or non-regulated stock exchange or securities market) before the first Interest Payment Date and to maintain such admission to trading for so long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding, save that if the Issuer is unable to maintain such admission to trading as aforesaid having used such endeavours or if the Issuer delivers to the Trustee a certificate of the Issuer signed by two of its Directors that the maintenance of such admission to trading is unduly onerous and the Trustee is satisfied that the interests of the Bondholders would not be materially prejudiced thereby, the Issuer undertakes to use its best endeavours to obtain an admission to trading for the Bonds on such other stock exchange or competent listing authority as is commonly used for the admission to trading of equity linked debt securities as the Issuer may from time to time determine and as may be approved by the Trustee and the Issuer will forthwith give notice to the Bondholders and the Trustee of any such admission to trading or failure to admit to trading of the Bonds on any of such stock exchanges.
The Issuer has undertaken in the Trust Deed to deliver to the Trustee annually and on request of the Trustee a certificate of two directors of the Issuer, as to there not having occurred an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default (as defined in the Trust Deed) since the date of the last such certificate or if such event has occurred as to the details of such event. The Trustee will be entitled to rely on such certificate and shall not be obliged to independently monitor compliance by the Issuer with the undertakings set forth in this Condition 11, nor be liable to any person for not so doing.
12 Prescription
Claims against the Issuer for payment in respect of the Bonds shall be prescribed and become void unless made within 10 years (in the case of principal) or five years (in the case of interest) from the appropriate Relevant Date in respect of such payment.
Claims in respect of any other amounts payable in respect of the Bonds shall be prescribed and become void unless made within 10 years following the due date for payment thereof.

A32526088

39

13 Replacement of Bonds

Mutilated or defaced Bonds must be surrendered before replacements will be issued.
14 Meetings of Bondholders, Modification and Waiver, Substitution
(a) Meetings of Bondholders
The Trust Deed contains provisions for convening meetings of Bondholders to consider matters affecting their interests, including the sanctioning by Extraordinary Resolution of a modification of any of these Conditions or any provisions of the Trust Deed. Such a meeting may be convened by the Issuer or the Trustee and shall be convened by the Issuer if requested in writing by Bondholders holding not less than 10 per cent. in principal amount of the Bonds for the time being outstanding. The quorum for any meeting convened to consider an Extraordinary Resolution will be one or more persons holding or representing a clear majority in principal amount of the Bonds for the time being outstanding, or at any adjourned meeting one or more persons being or representing Bondholders whatever the principal amount of the Bonds so held or represented, unless the business of such meeting includes consideration of proposals, inter alia, (i) to change the Final Maturity Date, the First Call Date (other than deferring the First Call Date) or the dates on which interest is payable in respect of the Bonds, (ii) to modify the circumstances in which the Issuer or Bondholders are entitled to redeem the Bonds pursuant to Condition 7(b) (Redemption at the Option of the Issuer), (c) (Redemption for Taxation Reasons) or (e) (Redemption at the Option of Bondholders Upon a Change of Control or a Free Float Event), (iii) to reduce or cancel the principal amount of, or interest on, the Bonds or to reduce the amount payable on redemption of the Bonds, (iv) to modify the basis for calculating the interest payable in respect of the Bonds, (v) to modify the provisions relating to, or cancel, the Conversion Rights (other than pursuant to or as a result of any amendments to these Conditions and the Trust Deed made pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Condition 11(g) (Undertakings) ("Newco Scheme Modification"), and other than a reduction to the Conversion Price), (vi) to increase the Conversion Price (other than in accordance with these Conditions or pursuant to a Newco Scheme Modification), (vii) to change the currency of the denomination or any payment in respect of the Bonds, (viii) to change the governing law of the Bonds, the Trust Deed or the Agency Agreement (other than in the case of a substitution of the Issuer (or any previous substitute or substitutes) under Condition 14(c) (Substitution)), or (ix) to modify the provisions concerning the quorum required at any meeting of Bondholders or the majority required to pass an Extraordinary Resolution, in which case the necessary quorum will be one or more persons holding or representing not less than two-thirds, or at any adjourned meeting not less than one-third, in principal amount of the Bonds for the time being outstanding. Any Extraordinary Resolution duly passed shall be binding on Bondholders (whether or not they were present at the meeting at which such resolution was passed).
The Trust Deed provides that a resolution in writing signed by or on behalf of the holders of not less than 75 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of Bonds outstanding shall for all purposes be as valid and effective as an Extraordinary Resolution passed at a meeting of Bondholders duly convened and held. Such a resolution in writing may be contained in one document or several documents in the same form, each signed by or on behalf of one or more Bondholders.

A32526088

40

No consent or approval of Bondholders shall be required in connection with any Newco Scheme Modification.
(b) Modification and Waiver
The Trustee may agree, without the consent of the Bondholders, to (i) any modification of any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, any trust deed supplemental to the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, any agreement supplemental to the Agency Agreement, the Bonds or these Conditions which in the Trustee's opinion is of a formal, minor or technical nature or is made to correct a manifest error or to comply with mandatory provisions of law, and (ii) any other modification to the Trust Deed, any trust deed supplemental to the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, any agreement supplemental to the Agency Agreement, the Bonds or these Conditions (except as mentioned in the Trust Deed), and any waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach, of any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, any trust deed supplemental to the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, any agreement supplemental to the Agency Agreement, the Bonds or these Conditions which is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Bondholders. The Trustee may, without the consent of the Bondholders, determine any Event of Default or a Potential Event of Default (as defined in the Trust Deed) should not be treated as such, provided that in the opinion of the Trustee, the interests of Bondholders will not be materially prejudiced thereby. Any such modification, authorisation, waiver or determination shall be binding on the Bondholders and, if the Trustee so requires, such modification, authorisation, wavier or determination shall be notified to the Bondholders promptly in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices).
(c) Substitution
The Trustee may, without the consent of the Bondholders, agree any substitution as provided in, and for the purposes of, Condition 11(g) (Undertakings) or to the substitution in place of the Issuer (or any previous substitute or substitutes under this Condition) as the principal debtor under the Bonds and the Trust Deed of any Subsidiary of the Issuer subject to (a) the Bonds being unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Issuer, and (b) the Bonds continuing to be convertible or exchangeable into B Shares as provided in these Conditions mutatis mutandis as provided in these Conditions, with such amendments as the Trustee shall consider appropriate provided that in any such case, (x) the Trustee being satisfied that the interests of the Bondholders will not be materially prejudiced by the substitution, and (y) certain other conditions set out in the Trust Deed being complied with. In the case of such a substitution the Trustee may agree, without the consent of the Bondholders, to a change of the law governing the Bonds and/or the Trust Deed provided that such change would not in the opinion of the Trustee be materially prejudicial to the interests of the Bondholders. Any such substitution shall be binding on the Bondholders and shall be notified to the Bondholders promptly in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices).
(d) Entitlement of the Trustee
In connection with the exercise of its functions (including but not limited to those referred to in this Condition) the Trustee shall have regard to the interests of the Bondholders as a class and, in particular but without limitation, shall not have regard to the consequences of the exercise of its trusts, powers or discretions for individual Bondholders resulting from their being for any purpose domiciled or resident in, or otherwise connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any particular territory, and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Bondholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer or any other person any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Bondholders.

A32526088

41

15 Enforcement
The Trustee may at any time, at its discretion and without notice, take such proceedings, actions or steps (including lodging an appeal in any proceedings) against the Issuer as it may think fit to enforce the provisions of the Trust Deed and the Bonds, but it shall not be bound to take any such proceedings or any other action or step in relation to the Trust Deed or the Bonds unless (i) it shall have been so directed by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Bondholders or so requested in writing by the holders of at least one-quarter in principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding, and (ii) it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction. The Trustee may refrain from taking any action in any jurisdiction if the taking of such action in that jurisdiction would, in its opinion based upon legal advice in the relevant jurisdiction, be contrary to any law of that jurisdiction. Furthermore, the Trustee may also refrain from taking such action if it would otherwise render it liable to any person in that jurisdiction or if, in its opinion based upon such legal advice, it would not have the power to do the relevant thing in that jurisdiction by virtue of any applicable law in that jurisdiction or if it is determined by any court or other competent authority in that jurisdiction that it does not have such power. No Bondholder shall be entitled to (i) take any steps or action against the Issuer to enforce the performance of any of the provisions of the Trust Deed or the Bonds or (ii) take any other proceedings (including lodging an appeal in any proceedings) in respect of or concerning the Issuer, in each case unless the Trustee, having become bound so to take any such action, steps or proceedings, fails so to do within a reasonable period and the failure shall be continuing.
16 The Trustee
The Trust Deed contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from responsibility, including relieving it from taking steps, actions or proceedings unless indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction. The Trustee is entitled to enter into business transactions with the Issuer and any entity related to the Issuer without accounting for any profit.
The Trustee may rely without liability to Bondholders on a report, confirmation or certificate or any advice of any accountants, financial advisers, financial institution or other expert, whether or not addressed to it and whether their liability in relation thereto is limited (by its terms or by any engagement letter relating thereto entered into by the Trustee or in any other manner) by reference to a monetary cap, methodology or otherwise. The Trustee may accept and shall be entitled to rely on any such report, confirmation or certificate or advice and such report, confirmation or certificate or advice shall be binding on the Issuer, the Trustee and the Bondholders.
17 Notices
All notices regarding the Bonds will be valid if published through the electronic communication system of Bloomberg. The Issuer shall also ensure that all notices are duly published (if such publication is required) in a manner which complies with the rules and regulations of any stock exchange or other relevant authority on which the Bonds are for the time being listed and/or admitted to trading. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such notice. If publication as provided above is not practicable, notice will be given in such other manner, and shall be deemed to be given on such date, as the Trustee may approve.
The Issuer shall send a copy of all notices given by it to Bondholders (or a Bondholder) or the Trustee, pursuant to these Conditions or otherwise, simultaneously to the Calculation Agent.
For so long as the Bonds are represented by a Global Bond registered in the name of, and held by a nominee on behalf of, a common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, notices to Bondholders may instead or in addition be given by the delivery of the relevant notice to Euroclear and/or Clearstream,

18 Further Issues
The Issuer may from time to time without the consent of the Bondholders create and issue further notes, bonds or debentures either having the same terms and conditions in all respects as the outstanding notes, bonds or debentures of any series (including the Bonds) or in all respects except for the first payment of interest on them and the first date on which Conversion Rights may be exercised and so that such further issue shall be consolidated and form a single series with the outstanding notes, bonds or debentures of any series (including the Bonds) or upon such terms as to interest, conversion, premium, redemption, form and otherwise as the Issuer may determine at the time of their issue. Any further notes, bonds or debentures forming a single series with the outstanding notes, bonds or debentures of any series (including the Bonds) constituted by the Trust Deed or any deed supplemental to it shall, and any other notes, bonds or debentures may, with the consent of the Trustee, be constituted by a deed supplemental to the Trust Deed.

20 Governing Law and Jurisdiction
(a) Governing Law
The Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and the Bonds and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with them (other than the creation and issue of B Shares upon exercise of Conversion Rights in respect of the Bonds, which shall be governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, Swedish law) are governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, English law.
(b) Jurisdiction
The courts of England are to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which may arise out of or in connection with the Trust Deed or the Bonds or any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with them and accordingly any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Trust Deed or the Bonds or any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with them ("Proceedings") may be brought in such courts. The Issuer has in the Trust Deed irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts and has waived any objection to Proceedings in such courts whether on the ground of venue or on the ground that the Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. This submission is made for the benefit of the Trustee and each of the Bondholders and shall not limit the right of any of them to take Proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking of Proceedings in one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not).
(c) Agent for Service of Process
The Issuer has irrevocably appointed Recipharm Limited at its registered office for the time being, currently at Bardsley Vale Mills, Oldham Road, Ashton Under Lyne, Lancashire, OL7 9RR, United
