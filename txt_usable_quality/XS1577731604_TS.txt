PART A -- CONTRACTUAL TERMS

PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS - The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area ("EEA") after the effective date of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the "PRIIPs Regulation"). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU ("MiFID II"); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC ("IMD"), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the "Prospectus Directive"). Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

Terms used herein shall be deemed to be defined as such for the purposes of the Conditions (the "Conditions") set forth in the base prospectus dated 21 February 2017 which constitutes a base prospectus (the "Base Prospectus") for the purposes of the Prospectus Directive. This document constitutes the Final Terms of the Notes described herein for the purposes of Article 5.4 of the Prospectus Directive. These Final Terms contain the final terms of the Notes and must be read in conjunction with such Base Prospectus.

Full information on the Issuer and the offer of the Notes described herein is only available on the basis of the combination of these Final Terms and the Base Prospectus. The Base Prospectus is available on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange http://www.ise.ie/Market-DataAnnouncements/Debt/Individual-Debt-Instrument-Data/Dept-SecurityDocuments/?progID=750&uID=5437&FIELDSORT=docId and for viewing during normal business hours at the registered office of the Issuer at Karaportti 3, FI-02610, Espoo, Finland.

DISTRIBUTION U.S. Selling Restrictions:

simply means that the Notes are intended upon issue to be deposited with one of the ICSDs as common safekeeper and does not necessarily mean that the Notes will be recognised as eligible collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy and intra day credit operations by the Eurosystem either upon issue or at any or all times during their life. Such recognition will depend upon the ECB being satisfied that Eurosystem eligibility criteria have been met.
