To the bondholders in:
ISIN: SE0006594412 - 4finance S.A. maximum SEK 600,000,000 Senior Unsecured Callable Fixed Rate Bonds 2015/2018
NOTICE OF AMENDMENTS
This notice (the "Notice") has been sent on 22 November 2016 to Bondholders directly registered in the debt register (Sw. skuldbok) kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. This Notice has also been published on the website of the Agent and on the website of the Issuer, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Bonds (the "Terms and Conditions").
Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) (the "Agent") is under the Terms and Conditions appointed as Agent for the above mentioned bond issue where 4finance S.A. is the issuer (the "Issuer").
All capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this Notice shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Terms and Conditions and any reference in this Notice to a Clause shall be a reference to such Clause in the Terms and Conditions.
The Issuer is the finance company of the Group and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo, which in turn is wholly owned by 4finance Group S.A. (the "Parent", together with its subsidiaries the "4finance Group"). The 4finance Group has been reorganised since the Issue Date, at which time HoldCo was the ultimate parent company of the group. It is the wish of the Issuer and the 4finance Group that the Issuer shall continue to serve as a finance company also after this reorganisation. In order to be efficient in this capacity, the Issuer would need to provide funds to the Parent in order to finance investments and operations involving entities within the 4finance Group but outside of the Group. In order to facilitate the 4finance Group's current and future financing needs, the Issuer has proposed that loans may be granted to HoldCo's direct shareholders or the Subsidiaries of such direct shareholders (excluding other Group Companies), provided that such loan for all purposes under the Terms and Conditions shall be treated and calculated as a Restricted Payment, whereby the relevant loan will be permitted if (and only if) all relevant requirements for making a permitted Restricted Payment under Clause 12.1.1 are met.
In light of the above, the Issuer has requested that the Agent agrees to amend the Terms and Conditions, with reference to the definition "Permitted Loans" in Clause 1.1 and the definition "Restricted Payment" in Clause 12.1.1.
Since the Issuer and the Agent have deemed that the proposed amendments would not be detrimental to the interest of the Bondholders, the Issuer and the Agent, in accordance with Clause 18.1 (a), agree to the amendments set out in the table below.

The amendments are not deemed to be detrimental to the interest of the Holders. To the contrary, the amendments are deemed to place the Holders in a better position compared to other funding alternatives available to the Issuer under the current version of the Terms and Conditions. Firstly, the amendments will not increase the total amount of cash permitted to leave the Group under the Terms and Conditions. Secondly, the Issuer intends that any loans would be properly documented, provided on arm's length terms and carry interest at market rates, thus creating a legal enforceable claim against the borrower. Hence, the granting of a loan will place the Issuer in a better financial position compared to if the same amount were to be provided through another type of permitted Restricted Payment, such as a dividend, which from an accounting perspective would be "money out" of the Group. Thirdly, by making funds efficiently available to the 4finance Group through loans (and thereby avoiding the time and cost consuming process of up-streaming funds through intra-group dividends), such funds may be applied towards, inter alia, profitable acquisitions, investments in joint ventures, launch of new products and other diversification of the business of the 4finance Group, which may also be in the best interest of the Group and ultimately the Holders. Finally, the amendment aligns the Terms and Conditions with terms and conditions for the other bonds issued by the Issuer which already allows the Issuer to grant loans to the Parent. The amendments became effective on 21 November 2016. The full version of the updated Terms and Conditions are published on the website of the Agent (www.nordictrustee.com/obligationsvillkor) and on the website of the Issuer (www .4finance.com).
