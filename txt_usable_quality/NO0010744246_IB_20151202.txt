To the bondholders in: ISIN: NO 001 0744246 - 12 per cent. NSA Bondco Limited Secured Callable Bond Issue 2015/2020 (the "Bonds")
Reference is made to the bond agreement for the Bonds (the "Bond Agreement"). Unless otherwise defined herein, terms shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Bond Agreement.
In accordance with Clause 9.1.1 of the Bond Agreement, NSA Bondco Limited (the "Company") is required to pay interest on the Face Value of the Bonds on 2 December 2015 (the "Interest Payment Date"). The accrued interest as of the Interest Payment Date was $3,409,225.50 (the "Accrued Interest").
Since the Excess Cash Amount was insufficient to pay the full amount of Accrued Interest, a cash distribution approximately equal to the Excess Cash Amount, i.e. $1,412,630.50 was made to the Bondholders on the Interest Payment Date. Additionally, in accordance with Clause 9.1.5 of the Bond Agreement, the approximate difference between the Accrued Interest and the Excess Cash Amount, i.e. $1,996,595.00, was settled through the issuance of additional Bonds to the Bondholders.
