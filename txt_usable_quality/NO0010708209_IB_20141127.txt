HARKAND FINANCE INC. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Reporting entity The Company was incorporated on 3 March 2014 and is domiciled in the Marshall Islands. On 28 March 2014 the Company completed the issue of secured senior notes ("Bond"). In connection with the release of the proceeds from the Bond, the Company became the owner through its two subsidiary companies, of two Dive Support Vessels ("DSVs"). The DSVs are chartered to related companies, which are market-leading global names in subsea inspection, repair, maintenance and survey of offshore oil and gas fields. This market, as well as light construction/construction support, is sound and growing.
2. Statement of compliance These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"). The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to the period presented in these financial statements and/or are expected to apply to subsequent periods.

HARKAND FINANCE INC. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
3. Summary of significant accounting policies 3.1 Going concern
The Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors have prepared and considered forecast cash flows (extended beyond one year from the signing of the financial statements) and the future operations of the Group. These considerations have included an assessment of forecast covenant compliance. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and the financial statements have therefore been prepared under the going concern basis. 3.2 Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing whether potential voting rights contribute to control, the Group examines all facts and circumstances that affect potential voting rights, except the intention of management and the financial ability to exercise and convert such rights. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. 3.3 Foreign currency Functional and presentational currency The Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currency are initially recorded by the Group entities at their respective functional currency exchange rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency exchange rate at the reporting date. All differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are taken to the statement of comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on retranslation of non-monetary items is treated in line with recognition of gain or loss on change in the fair value item (i.e. translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income or profit or loss is also recognised in the same place).

HARKAND FINANCE INC. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
3.4 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: (a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company (or Group as the case may be) to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company (or Group); and (b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company's own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company's own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments. To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where a financial instrument that contains both equity and financial liability components exists these components are separated and accounted for individually under the above policy.
3.5 Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables. Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the cash flow statement. Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the liabilities are derecognised. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate (EIR). The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income.

HARKAND FINANCE INC. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
3.6 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment, other than vessels, are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:  Vessels 25 years The residual value and useful life of each asset is reviewed at each financial period end and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for prospectively in the statement of comprehensive income in the period of the change and future periods. An increase in the residual value of an asset will decrease the depreciation charge for the period and future periods and vice versa. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds less cost of sale with the carrying amount and are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant spare parts initially recognised are derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Vessels are measured at fair value less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Valuations are performed with sufficient frequency to ensure that the fair value of a revalued asset does not differ materially from its carrying amount. A revaluation surplus is credited to the asset revaluation reserve in equity. Upon disposal, a revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.
3.7 Dry docking and mobilisation expenditure The Group's vessels are required to undergo periodic dry dockings for replacement of certain components, major repairs and maintenance of other components. Dry docking surveys are generally required to be held twice within a five-year cycle, for bottom surveys and for repairs related to inspections, with a maximum of 36 months between inspections. An in-water survey may be permitted in lieu of a dry-docking for the intermediate survey, although the vessel must carry out a dry-docking in conjunction with a special survey. Dry docking costs are capitalised and amortised in the statement of comprehensive income over the period to the next dry docking. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.

3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
3.8 Impairment of assets Financial assets (including receivables)
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably. Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and there is observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through the statement of comprehensive income.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit"). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash generating units, or ("CGU"). Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
3.9 Provisions A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of comprehensive income net of any reimbursement.
3.10 Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding taxes or duty and after eliminating revenue within the Group. The Group assesses its revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. The Group has concluded that it is acting as principal in all of its revenue arrangements. The following specific recognition criteria must be met before revenue is recognised. Charter Hire Revenues from time charter contracts including mobilisation/demobilisation fees are accounted for as the provision of a service and recognised on a reducing balance basis over the charter period. Accrued revenue is recognised for all hires to the end of the financial reporting period in respect of time charters in progress but not yet invoiced. Equally revenue is deferred where it has been invoiced in advance. Any contractual rate changes over the contract's term, to the extent they relate to the firm period of the contract, are taken into account when calculating the daily hire rate.
3.11 Current versus non-current classification The Group presents assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position based on current/non-current classification. An asset is current when it is:  Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle  Held primarily for the purpose of trading  Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or  Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:  It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle  It is held primarily for the purpose of trading  it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or  There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after
the reporting period
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent assets and liabilities.
13

HARKAND FINANCE INC. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
3.12 Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
3.13 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
3.14 Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date, whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement. Group as a lessor When assets are leased out under a finance lease, the present value of the lease payments is recognised as a receivable. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance income. The method for allocating gross earnings to accounting periods is referred to as the 'actuarial method'. The actuarial method allocates rentals between finance income and repayment of capital in each accounting period in such a way that finance income will emerge as a constant rate of return on the lessor's net investment in the lease. When assets are leased out under an operating lease, the asset Is included in the statement of comprehensive income based on the nature of the asset. Lease income on operating leases is recognised over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis.
14

HARKAND FINANCE INC. Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
4. Summary of estimates, judgements and assumptions The preparation of the Group's interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim consolidated financial statements. However, uncertainty about these estimates, judgements and assumptions could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
There are no comparative interim consolidated financial statements since the Company was incorporated during the year. 5. New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted The Group adopted the following standards on 4 March 2014:
Amendments to IAS 32, Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
The amendments in IAS 32 clarify certain items regarding offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively and will be effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014 with earlier application permitted. The amendment has had no impact on the Group's financial presentation or performance.
Amendments to IAS 36, Impairment ofAssets
These narrow-scope amendments to IAS 36 address the disclosure of information about the recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. Earlier application is permitted for periods when the entity has already applied IFRS 13. The standard has had no impact on the Group's financial position or performance.
IFRIC Interpretation 21, Levies
The interpretation clarifies that an entity recognizes a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. It also clarifies that a levy liability is accrued progressively only if the activity that triggers payment occurs over a period of time, in accordance with the relevant legislation. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the interpretation clarifies that no liability should be recognized before the specified minimum threshold is reached. The standard has had no impact on the Group's financial position or performance.
New standards, interpretations and amendments thereof not yet effective
Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group's interim consolidated financial statements are listed below. This listing of standards and interpretations issued are those that the Group reasonably expects to have an impact on disclosures, financial position or performance when applied at a future date.
The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective.
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement
IFRS 9 as issued reflects the first phase of the lASB's work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The mandatory date of adoption for this standard has not been set. The Group will continue to assess any impact on the classification and measurement of the Group's financial assets, as well as any impact on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities.

HARKAND EMEA GROUP
Notes to the Condensed Unaudited Interim Aggregated Financial Statements
1. Basis of preparation The Harkand EMEA Group was created on 28 March 2014 and includes the companies listed in note 5. The condensed unaudited interim aggregated financial statements reflect the performance of Harkand EMEA Group for the period 28 March 2014 to 30 September 2014.
As there is no common parent the financial statements for the Harkand EMEA Group have been prepared by aggregating relevant sub-group consolidations. Intercompany balances and transactions between the sub-groups are eliminated as appropriate in arriving to the aggregated financial statements. The European and African operational businesses of Harkand Luxembourg Holdings SARL were transferred to Harkand EMEA Group on 16 April 2014. The results of these operational businesses from 16 April 2014 to 30 September 2014 are reflected in the condensed unaudited interim aggregated statement of comprehensive income. 2. Statement of compliance These condensed unaudited interim aggregated financial statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and they have not been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"). However selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group's financial position and performance since date of incorporation.
3. Summary of estimates, judgements and assumptions The preparation of the Group's condensed unaudited interim aggregated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim aggregated financial statements. However, uncertainty about these estimates, judgements and assumptions could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
4. New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted The Group adopted the following standards on 1 January 2014:
Amendments to IAS 32, Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
The amendments in IAS 32 clarify certain items regarding offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively and will be effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014 with earlier application permitted. The amendment has had no impact on the Group's financial presentation or performance.
7

HARKAND EMEA GROUP
Notes to the Condensed Unaudited Interim Aggregated Financial Statements 4. New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted (continued)
Amendments to IAS 36, Impairment o f Assets These narrow-scope amendments to IAS 36 address the disclosure of information about the recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. Earlier application is permitted for periods when the entity has already applied IFRS 13. The standard has had no impact on the Group's financial position or performance. IFRIC Interpretation 21, Levies The interpretation clarifies that an entity recognizes a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. It also clarifies that a levy liability is accrued progressively only if the activity that triggers payment occurs over a period of time, in accordance with the relevant legislation. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the interpretation clarifies that no liability should be recognized before the specified minimum threshold is reached. The standard has had no impact on the Group's financial position or performance. New standards, interpretations and amendments thereof not yet effective Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group's interim aggregated financial statements are listed below. This listing of standards and interpretations issued are those that the Group reasonably expects to have an impact on disclosures, financial position or performance when applied at a future date. The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective. IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement IFRS 9 as issued reflects the first phase of the lASB's work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The mandatory date of adoption for this standard has not been set. The Group will continue to assess any impact on the classification and measurement of the Group's financial assets, as well as any impact on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities.

HARKAND EMEA GROUP
Notes to the Condensed Unaudited Interim Aggregated Financial Statements 16. Commitments
Contingent liabilities Certain members of senior management participate in a long term incentive plan ("LTiP") that is run by Harkand Global Holdings Limited. This is a cash based LTIP where value crystallises for the individuals only on the sale of 80% or more of the equity in Harkand Global Holdings Limited by its shareholders or a similar exit event. No accounting entries have been made in relation to this scheme given that the liability is contingent at the balance sheet date.

Harkand EMEA Group Management Discussion and Analysis Three months ended 30 September 2014
General information
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Harkand EMEA Group ("Group") is the provision of subsea services (survey, inspection, repair, maintenance and light construction) to the international oil and gas industry. The Group's mission is to offer a high quality and cost effective service with a strong emphasis on safety and operational efficiency to the fast-growing subsea integrity management market.
Business review
The Group carries out operations in the North Sea and West Africa, and represents the majority of its revenues and assets. The Group has a long established presence in the North Sea, and is a leading provider of diving, ROV and survey services in the region. Over the past two years the Group has also established a strong presence in West Africa, and recently transitioned management of the Africa region to its Houston office, which has considerable experience of running operations in Africa.
The Group was created through the combination of three businesses:
 Andrews Survey was founded in Aberdeen in 1978. By 2007 it had grown to a leading contractor in the hydrographic and subsea survey sector in the North Sea. In 2007 it was acquired by ISS.
 Harkand UK (formerly ISS) was founded in Aberdeen in 2002. By 2011 it had grown to become a leading provider of diving and ROV services in its core North Sea market, with regional offices in Singapore, Australia and Azerbaijan. It was acquired by Oaktree in 2012 and combined with Iremis.
 Harkand West Africa (formerly Iremis) was founded by Oaktree in 2011 with the acquisition of the Atlantis and Da Vinci vessels. Based in UAE, its key markets were West Africa and the North Sea. Oaktree's acquisition of ISS in 2012 allowed the creation of the Harkand Group in 2013, bringing Harkand's vessels access to and utilisation in the North Sea market.
The three businesses were highly complementary, combining Iremis' modern high-end assets with ISS and Andrews Survey's extended range of services.
The Group owns the key assets of the Harkand Group: Two state-of-the-art DSVs, the Atlantis and the Da Vinci, and the Harkand Group's entire fleet of 32 ROVs. The Group operates 21 ROVs itself, while the remaining 11 ROVs are chartered to other companies within the Harkand Group. Seven ROVs are chartered to Harkand GOM (in the US) and four are chartered to Harkand APAC.
Future developments
The formation of the Harkand Group provides a strong commercial, technical, financial and governance platform from which to consolidate the industry and create a market-leading name in subsea inspection, repair, maintenance and survey of offshore oil and gas fields. The Group is focused on attaining the highest standards in health, safety, quality and environmental performance along with first class project execution.

Commentary on financial performance

Utilisation rates for vessels favourable overall against prior year but falling slightly in September
Utilisation of vessels has been good over the three months ended 30 September 2014. The Atlantis was fully utilised in July and August and delivered strong margin. The Da Vinci performed well on 3 projects and has delivered stable margins. Both DSVs suffered lower utilisation rates than expected in September as external market conditions began to take effect.
In addition there are 2 ROVSVs operating in Europe. The Go Electra has been used in ROVSV and Air Diving Mode with almost full utilisation. The Surf Ranger's performance was strong in July however it required some technical work in August before mobilising to its next project. The Surf Ranger was utilised less than expected in September owing to the downward trend in the market.
Sell rates have been strong in the North Sea
The average sell rates across the 4 vessels has been good. The Atlantis and Da Vinci have been achieving sell rates favourable to expectations benefiting from the strong North Sea rates during the period. The Da Vinci in particular has managed sell rates well ahead of prior year.
The Go Electra and Surf Ranger average sell rates have been better than the prior year overall.
Survey business continues to perform well and is ahead of expectations
The survey business continues to perform well, which has been reflected in favourable gross margins compared to prior year. It has been ahead of expectations for the quarter.
First steps in West Africa growth strategy made
A permanent presence has been established in the quarter. The Harkand commercial team have been working with Harkand's local partners leading to positive meetings with potential clients. Progress is being made and bids have been submitted.
Management see good demand for Harkand's service in the West Africa market and consider this to be a part of the Harkand EMEA's overall growth strategy.
