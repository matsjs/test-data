To the bondholders in the Teodin Acquico AS (Helly Hansen) Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2012/2017, ISIN NO 001 065989.9
Oslo, 7 July 2014
SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - REQUEST FOR WAIVERS/AMENDMENTS
Nordic Trustee ASA, (formerly Norsk Tillitsmann ASA) (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue") where Teodin Acquico AS (the "Issuer") is the issuer.
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement dated 27 September 2012 and made between the Bond Trustee and the Issuer (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. BACKGROUND
The Issuer is to a large extent a two season company, spring/summer and autumn/winter. The autumn/winter season normally accounts for approximately 60% of revenue and contribution. With an average production lead time of four-six months, significant net working capital is being tied up in the company during late autumn leading up to winter sales. The peak net working capital is then released towards year-end. The net working capital swing from July to October is expected to be some NOK 400 million for 2014 and 2015.
When establishing the capital structure for the Issuer following the acquisition by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan in 2012 (the "Transaction"), a NOK 200 million revolving credit facility was put in place and the leverage covenant was set seeking to cope with large fluctuations quarter to quarter to accommodate the working capital swing. As the net working capital situation is fairly unpredictable month to month, large changes in net working capital make management spend significant resources in complying with covenants. For instance, executing a bulk purchase in March instead of April could potentially lead to the change in the cash position affecting the leverage and hence covenant compliance. The Issuer hence sees a need to amend the covenant structure in both the bank and Bond Agreement to have a more predictable covenant regime better suited to the inherent operations of the company.
Since the Transaction, the Issuer has overperformed vis-a-vis the market and realized 16% revenue growth from 2012 to 2013. Nevertheless, the Issuer has underperformed the bank and bond case in 2012 and 2013. High growth is expected for 2014, mainly driven by strong momentum in the Nordic countries as well as a number of commercial successes in the US market. During 2012 and 2013 the Issuer has agreed extended credit periods with their main supplier and sourcing partner Li&Fung (a partner mainly handling sourcing in Asia). The Issuer has during the last year set up in-house sourcing in Asia through a new office in Hong Kong that will carry out roughly half of the company's sourcing

need. The Issuer foresees a net annual saving of some NOK 10 million (expected to increase proportionally with the expected increase in Asian sourcing), but at the same time they see a need to reduce the credit period with Li&Fung now that the transition is being implemented. The Issuer expects to have returned to normal credit periods with Li&Fung by the end of 2014.
1.1 Bank Amendments
The Issuer has approached Nordea to find a solution to the covenant issue and a potential net working capital- and thus liquidity shortfall towards the winter season ramp-up in Q3 2014. The following amendments have been credit approved by Nordea:
· New Leverage Covenants · Amendments to the calculation of Cash Flow Cover Ratio · A new seasonal facility (the "Seasonal Facility") will be implemented on the following
conditions: o The Seasonal Facility will only be available between August and November each year o For the year 2014, the Seasonal Facility will amount to NOK 60 million o For 2015 and 2016, the Seasonal Facility will amount to NOK 120 million contingent on the company having shown an EBITDA o f NOK 200 million on a rolling twelve month basis by the end of Q2 each year. An EBITDA shortfall to the NOK 200 million threshold will reduce the Seasonal Facility with the same amount down to a floor of NOK 165 million. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seasonal Facility will not be provided if EBITDA is less than NOK 165 million. (Example: At the end of Q2 2015 EBITDA stands at NOK 185 million (i.e. a 15 million shortfall). The Seasonal Facility provided for 2015 will hence be NOK 105 million (NOK 120 million less the 15 million shortfall) o The Seasonal Facility will be an ancillary facility, be part of the revolving credit facility and be secured by the same security that secures the bank- and bond financing
· Starting 1 January 2015, restriction on the use of interest-bearing supplier financing will be introduced so that the aggregate of the current RCF (i.e. excluding any amount made available under the Seasonal Facility) and interest-bearing supplier financing should not exceed the current RCF limit of NOK 200m.
1.2 Equity Injection
To improve the current liquidity situation the owners will inject NOK 60 million of new equity by the end of July 2014. The equity injection will be used to increase the cash balance in the company.

2. PROPOSAL
In accordance with clause 19.2 of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer has asked the Bond Trustee to convene a bondholders' meeting (the "Bondholders' Meeting") for the Bond Issue in order to consider the Issuer's request for the following waivers and amendments to the Bond Agreement (the "Proposal"):
· The Bondholders: o consent to the Leverage Ratio in Clause 16.2 to be amended as shown in Schedule 1 o consent to permanently release Teodin Holdco AS (i) from its guarantee obligations under the Bond Agreement and (ii) from its bank accounts security under the relevant Security Document (This release of guarantee and security is requested in order to remove the risk that the Issuer will incur a significant tax claim due to the adopted interest stripping rules. The Issuer has received the same guarantee and security release under the bank financing. The Issuer confirms that Teodin Holdco AS has no material assets except the shares in the Issuer which have been and will remain pledged, securing the bank facility and the Bonds.) o consent to consequential amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and authorise the Bond Trustee to enter into any amendment to the Finance Documents to document the proposals in the two former bullet points, to the extent required
On the back of the Proposal above the Issuer proposes a fee to the bondholders of 25 bps of the outstanding Bonds, that the payment at final maturity (clause 10.1) shall be increased from 100% to 101% and an increase of the call option premium in clause 10.2 (a) (i), (ii) and (iii) ofthe Bond Agreement with one percentage point, to 108%, 105.5% and 102%, respectively. The Proposal is further subject to the equity injection and Bank Amendments as set out in point 1.1.
Please note that investors holding more than 50% of the Bonds have submitted their pre-commitment to vote in favour ofthe Proposal.

It is proposed that the Bondholders' Meetings resolves the following:
"The Bondholders' Meeting approves the proposal as described in section 2 of the summons for the Bondholders' Meeting."
To approve the above resolution, Bondholders representing at least half of the Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the Bondholders' Meeting must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to have

a quorum, at least half (1/2) of the Voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting. If the proposal is not approved by the Bondholders, the Bond Agreement will remain unchanged.
Please find attached a Bondholder's Form (Schedule 2) from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' Meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm: (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.)
The individual Bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising the Bond Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post to post@nordictrustee.com, +47 22 87 94 10, or Nordic Trustee ASA, PO Box 1470 Vika, 0116 Oslo, Norway).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' Meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' Meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond Trustee, to notify the Bond Trustee by telephone or by email (at set out at the first page o f this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
