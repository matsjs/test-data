Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - proposal to make certain amendments of the Bond Agreement
1 INTRODUCTION
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") issued by Latina Offshore Limited (the "Company" or "Issuer").
Capitalised terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement originally entered into on 3 July 2013, as amended and restated pursuant to an amendment and restatement agreement dated 11 October 2013 (the "Bond Agreement").
Reference is made to the information from the Company published on Stamdata on 2 March 2016 (the "March Information Notice") and the Interim Accounts for first quarter 2016 and related press release published on the Parent's website 31 May 2016 (the "Interim Accounts Press Release"). Reference is also made to the summons letter dated 17 June 2016 (the "17 June Summons"), and the notice of 30 June 2016 concerning cancellation of the Bondholders' Meeting scheduled for 1 July 2016.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and the described transactions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
Bondholders are encouraged to read this summons letter in its entirety.
2 BACKGROUND
Rig 1 and Rig 2 (the "Jack-Up Rigs") owned by Rig 1 Owner and Rig 2 Owner respectively are currently bareboat chartered to the Parent, who in turn has chartered the rigs to Pemex.

2/9
As advised in the Interim Accounts Press Release the Parent is currently engaged in negotiations with Pemex of certain conditions of the contracts.
Pursuant to the Bond Agreement, on 3 July 2016 the Issuer shall repay an instalment of USD 15,000,000 o f the Bonds in accordance with Clause 10.1 of the Bond Agreement (the "July 2016 Instalment").
As stated in the 17 June Summons, pending completion of the negotiations with Pemex and to avoid a breach of the Bond Agreement during this period, the Issuer approached the Bondholders to ask for their consent to extend the July 2016 Instalment and make certain amendments to the Bond Agreement as described therein.
Following publication of the 17 June Summons, the Issuer has been in constructive discussion with certain bondholders representing more than 2/3 of the Bonds. On the basis of these discussions, the Issuer decided to withdraw the 17 June Summons and cancel the bondholders' meeting s u i ^ u i w ^ 1 hi & A u lo r i......................... T u h r OHlA VA j Uo1n1rUi instead set forth the revised proposal included herein.
The revised proposal includes a payment of USD 5 million in amortisation and deferral of USD 10 million for three months, whilst the proposal in the 17 June Summons entailed deferral of the entire USD 15 million amortisation payment. In addition, it is proposed that the minimum Liquidity in the period up until 30 September 2016 (the "Deferral Period") shall be reduced from USD 10 million to USD 5 million.
3 PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE BOND AGREEMENT
In accordance with Clause 16.2 of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer has approached the Bond Trustee to convene a meeting of Bondholders ("Bondholders' Meeting") in order to consider the Issuer's request to amend the terms of the Bonds as set out below, pursuant to the authority given to the Bondholders' Meeting under Clause 16.1 of the Bond Agreement.
The Issuer proposes that the Bond Agreement is amended in accordance with the proposed amendments in sections 3.1 to 3.4 (the "Proposal"): 3.1 Deferral of the July 2016 Instalment It is proposed that the July 2016 Instalment in part shall be postponed to 30 September 2016 (the "September 2016 Payment Date").
Accordingly, Clause 10.1.1 of the Bond Agreement is proposed to read as follows:
"The Bonds shall be repaid by the Issuer with an amount o f USD 8,750,000 on the Interest Payment Date in January 2015, with an amount o f USD 15,000,000 on the Interest Payment Date in July 2015 and on the Interest Payment Date in January 2016, with an amount o f USD 5 million on the Interest Payment Date in July 2016, with an amount o f USD 10 million on the September 2016 Payment Date and with an amount o f USD 15 million on each subsequent Interest Payment Date up to and including the Interest Payment Date in January 2018. The remaining outstanding amount under the Bonds shall be repaid at the Maturity Date.
L 7805171 VI 30.06.16 526073-003

3/9
For the avoidance of doubt, no interest for late payment in accordance with Clause 11.4 (only regular interest in accordance with Clause 9) of the Bond Agreement shall accrue on the USD 10 million referred to above in the period from the Interest Payment Date in July 2016 to the September 2016 Payment Date.
3.2 Amendment of minimum Liquidity covenant It is proposed (i) that the minimum Liquidity for the Deferral Period shall be reduced from USD 10 million to USD 5 million and (ii) that the Liquidity shall be comprised of at least USD 5 million cash on an account with the Paying Agent pledged and blocked in favour o f the Bondholders.
Accordingly, Clause 13.6.1 of the Bond Agreement is proposed to read as follows:
"The Issuer shall at all times (i) maintain no less than USD 5 million in an account with the Paying Agent pledged and blocked in favour o f the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders (the "Retained Amount") and (ii) maintain a Liquidity (on a consolidated basis) which together with the Retained Amount (a) in the period up to and including 30 September 2016 is no less than USD 5,000,000 and (b) thereafter is no less than USD 10,000,000. 3.3 Suspension of transfers to certain accounts and coverage of OPEX for the Rigs during the
Deferral Period The requirement to make certain transfers and payments to the Interest Retention Account pursuant to Clause 13.2.17 of the Bond Agreement and the requirement to make certain transfer and payments in accordance with Clause 13.5.1 - 13.5.5 of the Bond Agreement, including the payment of hire under the Bareboat Charters, and Clause 13.8.6 shall be suspended during the Deferral Period. Prior to and no later than at the expiry of the Deferral Period, the Issuer shall ensure that an amount equivalent to the build-up that should have been made during the Deferral Period is immediately transferred to the Interest Retention Account, and so that an amount equal to 3/6 o f the next interest payment on the Bonds shall be standing to the credit of the Interest Retention Account on 3 October 2016.
Any amount standing to the credit of the Accounts after (i) payment of interest on the Interest Payment Date in July 2016, (ii) payment of USD 5,000,000 in amortisation on the Interest Payment Date in July 2016 and (iii) appropriation of the Retained Amount, may be transferred by the relevant account holder to the Parent to directly or indirectly pay operating expenses of the Parent, the Issuer, Rig 1 Owner and/or Rig 2 Owner in relation to the Rigs.
Any earnings received from the Charter Contract(s), paid into the Parent Earnings Account or otherwise, may be used by the Parent to directly or indirectly pay operating expenses of the Parent, the Issuer, Rig 1 Owner and/or Rig 2 Owner in relation to the Rigs. 3.4 Bondholders' Meeting The Bond Agreement shall be amended to allow for summons to Bondholders' Meetings to be dispatched with 5 (rather than 10) Business Days' notice. Accordingly, Clause 16.2.4 of the Bond Agreement shall be amended to read as follows:
L 7805171 VI 30.06.16 526073-003

4/9
"The summons to a Bondholders 'Meeting shall be dispatched no later than five Business Days prior to the date o f the Bondholders ' Meeting. The summons and a confirmation o f each Bondholder's holdings o f Bonds shall be sent to all Bondholders registered in the Securities Depository at the time o f distribution. The Exchange shall also be informed if the Bonds are listed." 3.5 Written resolution The Bond Agreement shall be amended to allow matters which may be resolved in a Bondholders' Meeting to be resolved by way of a written resolution procedure. Accordingly, a new Clause 16.5 shall be included in the Bond Agreement in accordance with the form attached as Schedule B. 3.6 Amendment to Bond Agreement and miscellaneous Save for such amendments as are necessary to reflect the Proposal, the Bond Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
The Proposal requested by the Issuer shall have effect immediately upon approval of the Proposal by the Bondholders' Meeting.
By approving the Proposal, the Bondholders acknowledge that regardless of the deferral requested herein, the Issuer will continue to pay its suppliers and operational expenses.
4 STANDSTILL UNDERTAKING PENDING BONDHOLDERS' MEETING The next amortisation payment under the Bond Agreement is due on 4 July 2016. In this respect (i) the Bond Trustee have undertaken to the Issuer not to declare an Event of Default unless it receives instruction from a relevant majority o f the Voting Bonds and (ii) Bondholders representing more than 2/3 of the Voting Bonds have undertaken to the Issuer not to declare or instruct to declare an Event of Default, in each case due to non-payment of amortisation due on such date in the period from 4 July 2016 to the time the Bondholders' Meeting is adjourned or cancelled.
5 EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL The Proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendation from the Bond Trustee. Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by any of the Bond Trustee or the Issuer or any of their respective advisors. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposal is acceptable and vote accordingly. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their legal, financial and tax advisers regarding the effect of the Proposal.
