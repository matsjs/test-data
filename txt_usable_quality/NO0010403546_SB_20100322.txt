2 THE RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL
2.1 The restructuring plan
Summarized the restructuring plan consists of a reduction/restructuring o f the Company's debt obligations to facilitate a new cash equity increase of approximately USD 40 million. This involves both bondholders and certain suppliers. The equity increase will have a subscription price of NOK 0.10 (equal to the par value o f the share). Bondholders and the other affected creditors will have the opportunity to convert their remaining claims into shares at the same price. Bondholders will also be given preferred allocation in the private placement.
2.2 The proposed restructuring of the Loans
In short the Borrower asks for the bondholders consent to a debt write off of 40 % of principal and accrued interest, with an option for each individual bondholder to convert the remaining loan (i.e. 60 % of principal and accrued interest) into common shares of the Borrower at a price of NOK 0.10 per share (equal to the nominal value of each share and also equivalent to the issue price of the new private placement). Please see the enclosed Exhibit 2-5; Voluntary Exchange Offer & Acceptance Form(s) hereto for further information.
Furthermore the Borrower will be given an option to pay 12 months of interest in kind (PIK) in order to preserve liquidity in this critical stage.
The proposed restructuring of the Loans is inter alia conditioned upon approval by the bondholder meetings in all the Loans, approval in the extraordinary general meeting of the Borrower and the completion of minimum NOK 240 million equity increase. Reference is made to the resolutions below for details.
2.3 Summary of shareholder structure post restructuring
Total number of outstanding shares and warrants today are 417,437,418 and 68,174,577 respectively. 28,500,000 of the warrants have a strike price of NOK 2.40, The remaining warrants (39,674,577) have currently a strike price o f NOK 1.0. Due to a reset mechanism in the latter warrants, the strike price will be reset to NOK 0.10 if the private placement is successful. The strike price for the other warrants will remain unchanged.
In addition there is a price adjustment mechanism giving right to have more shares issued at nominal value that replaced the anti dilution mechanism which was issued to converting bondholders in connection with the conversion of the $ 19 million convertible bond in December 2009. The rights that are not already triggered by share issues prior to the restructuring and refinancing is proposed removed. Individual consent from each investor is required to have the condition removed irrespective o f the resolutions

N O R S K T IL L IT S M A N N A SA
www. i ru srt'f . no

proposed on the extraordinary general meeting. Investors holding 59% of these rights have pre-accepted to delete this provision.
The restructuring will have effects on both the Borrower's capital structure and ownership structure. Both these will depend on the amount of bonds converted, which is an option each bondholder will have. If no conversion among bondholders, existing shareholders will retain a 15 % ownership of the Borrower. If all bondholders convert their bonds, existing shareholders will retain a 5 % ownership of the Borrower post restructuring and share capital increase.

3 EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES
3.1 Advisor
The Borrower has engaged Pareto Securities AS as the Borrower's financial advisor with respect to the Proposal. Accordingly, Bondholders may contact their contact person in Pareto Securities for further information.
Pareto Securities is acting solely for the Borrower and no-one else in connection with the Proposal. No due diligence investigations have been carried out by Pareto Securities with respect to the Borrower and Pareto Securities expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the Proposal (including but not limited to the information contained herein and in the Company Update enclosed to this summons!.

N O R SK T ILLITSM A N N ASA
www.mistee.no
3.2 Support from bondholders
The Borrower has been in discussions with its largest bondholders for several weeks. These have given their pre-acceptance to the proposal.
3.3 The Borrower's evaluation
The Borrower has an urgent liquidity need of approximately USD 50 million due to lack o f production, the expiry o f an overdraft facility not replaced, significant amounts of overdue bills to suppliers and weak near term cash flow generation.
A solution involving a short term loan was initially envisaged; however the balance sheet deterioration experienced in 4Q09 and continuing into 1Q10 made it impossible to raise any debt to bridge the liquidity gap. A comprehensive debt restructuring/write off is considered needed in order to attract sufficient new equity capital to secure operations going forward and to honour the Borrower's future liabilities. The debt level is viewed too high compared to the operational leverage and risk profile o f the Borrower.
Should the proposal and a solution not be reached, the Board o f Director of the Borrower will be forced to file for bankruptcy. Such a situation is unfortunately considered to provide a very low recovery value to all outstanding creditors o f the Borrower.
3.4 NTM's evaluation
The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the Proposal is acceptable.
It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their own financial, legal and tax advisers as to the possible consequences of the Proposal.
INFORMATION MEETING FOR BONDHOLDERS
The Borrower will hold an information meeting to update bondholders on the situation. Such meeting will be held at the premises of Norsk Tillitsmann Friday 26 March at 11.00 hours. Should you want to participate on this meeting please provide evidence of holdings in relevant bonds to Jens Samuelsen in Norsk Tillitsmann. samuelsen@frustee.no within Thursday 25 March at 16.00 hours.

MEMO

To: Copy: Subject:

From: Date:

March 22, 2010

In order for you as bondholders to assess the situation in better detail, we have provided you with a short company update. We also refer to our published fourth quarter report, recent press releases and notice of general meeting for further details.

Background
With reference to our 4 th quarter report we had a challenging end to 2009. Production was considerably penalized in 4Q due to both technical failures and lower cable handling speed in deep waters in Brazil. This also continued into 1Q10, where dow ntim e in com bination with delay in obtaining necessary environm ental licenses in Brazil hindered our crew to m ove into shallow er water until February 2010. This had a significant revenue impact for RXT while costs continued to accrue, causing negative cash contribution from our operations in Brazil.
On the liquidity side, we had anticipated replacing the Nordea overdraft facility repaid in Decem ber 2009. This has proved to be difficult in the current m arket. In addition our overdue bills to suppliers have increased, now reaching a level where actions are required due to our current low cash balance position and expected short term cash flow generation. Sum m arized the com pany has identified a liquidity need of approxim ately USD 50 m illion which will need to be covered within a short period of tim e in order to continue its operations.

Plan for re-structuring
The com pany has over the last weeks been in discussion with its m ajor bondholders in the respective bonds in order to reach a restructuring proposal in order to preserve values for the Com pany's stakeholders and at the same time facilitate to attract new equity capital to the Com pany for continuing operations.
The Com pany initially envisaged raising the cash short fall in form of a short term loan in com bination with proceeds from the repair issue scheduled. The restructuring in Decem ber im proved the balance sheet of the Com pany. Flowever due to the significant net profit loss in 4Q09 of USDm 76.7 (also continuing into 1Q10) the impact more than offset this im provem ent causing a deterioration of the balance sheet and causing the Com pany alm ost breaching its covenants under its outstanding bonds. In addition, sufficient capital was not available am ong current stakeholders. Flence a debt offering was ruled out, and new equity capital remains the only realistic alternative funding source. The repair issue also became unrealistic due to the share price drop experienced on the back of the 4Q09 release.
It becam e apparent that in order to attract sufficient new equity capital to the Com pany the current debt level is considered too high, hence a com prehensive restructuring of the Com pany's capital structure is regretfully needed.
In short the proposal for the bondholders consist of a debt write off of 40% of principal and accrued interest, with an option for each individual bondholder to convert remaining position into common shares of RXT at a price of NOK 0.1 per share (equal to the nominal value of each share and also equivalent to the issue price of the new private placement).

Furtherm ore the Com pany will be given an option to pay 12 months of interest on the bonds in kind (PIK) in order to preserve liquidity in this critical stage.
The Com pany has also spent considerable time with its key suppliers to reduce their overdue claim s and to be cooperative in this critical stage, as other stakeholders in the Com pany. The dialogue with these creditors is progressing in a constructive m anner, and the aim is to reduce outstanding claim s through write offs/equity conversions with a liquidity effect of approxim ately USD 10 million.
The proposal to the Com pany's bondholders has been carefully considered by both the Company and its financial advisor (Pareto Securities) in order to preserve value on one side, and to attract sufficient new equity capital on the other side. A debt write off is unfortunate and regrettable, however considered needed as a m easure in order to attract sufficient equity capital to continue operations.
The restructuring of the bonds will inter alia be conditioned upon the approval of the Extraordinary General Meeting (the "EGM") and new equity of minimum NOK 240 million raised. The company has called for an EGM to be held on 12 April 2010.
The com pany is in the final stage of securing a short term loan of USD 5m from its largest stakeholders to bridge the liquidity gap until the restructuring is concluded.

Ownership post restructuring

Total number of outstanding shares and warrants today are 417,437,418 and 68,174,577 respectively. 28,500,000 of the warrants have a strike price of NOK 2.40. The remaining warrants (39,674,577) have currently a strike price of NOK 1.0. Due to a reset m echanism in the latter w arrants, the strike price will be reset to NOK 0.10 if the private placem ent is successful. The strike price for the other warrants will remain unchanged.
In addition there is an anti dilution m echanism on the shares which were issued in connection with the conversion of the $ 19 million convertible bond in Decem ber 2009. The rights that are not already triggered by share issues prior to the restructuring and refinancing is proposed removed. Individual consent from each investor is required to have the condition rem oved irrespective of the resolutions proposed on the extraordinary general meeting. The restructuring will have effects on both the Borrower's capital structure and ownership structure. Both these will depend on the am ount of bonds converted, which is an option each bondholder will have. If no conversion am ong bondholders, existing shareholders will retain a 15 % ownership of the Borrower, If ail bondholders convert their bonds, existing shareholders will retain a 5 % ownership of the Borrower post restructuring and share capital increase.

Status current operations
2009 has been a challenging year for RXT operation wise. RXT recorded its highest ever profitability in Q209 and then was seriously im pacted by technical challenges and downtim e in Q3 and Q4.
The Com pany has currently three crew s in operation, RXT2, RXT4 and RXT5. RXT4 and RXT5 are now producing very well in Brazil for Petrobras (where the Com pany has its largest contract), This will im prove the cash flow situation going forward. The production in Brazil is expected to continue m ainly on shallow w ater and thus rem ain on a stable high level over the next quarter. In the end of 2Q10 RXT will have to move back into deep w ater in Brazil to conclude its work. The rem aining w ork related to deep water represents approx 5% of the rem aining w ork in Brazil. The ongoing join t efforts with ION (the equipm ent supplier) should contribute to improve the technical challenges experienced on deep w ater in advance of this move.
Our recently com m unicated contract awards will see us back in the North Sea. Both Vikiand and Ocean Pearl will start working in 2Q10 and operate throughout 3Q10. Furtherm ore RXT is currently bidding for more contracts in the North Sea which could im prove fleet utilisation in the second part of the year.
Despite that the value of our outstanding tenders decreased from $ 1,100 million from end 3Q09 to $ 650 m illion currently (reduction m ainly due to one large project in Middle East that was awarded away from RXT prim arily, we believe, because we could not provide the full range of services needed). Bidding activity is still healthy and the activity level is much higher com pared to the sam e period last year. We see clear signs that the m arket for OBC w ork is im proving as m ore and more oil com panies recognize the value of m ufti-com ponent ocean bottom cable (OBC) acquisition, providing them with better reservoir im aging in obstructed areas where stream er seism ic data is poor or non-existent. RXT expects this trend to continue with repeat custom ers, as well as new custom ers, driving the utilization rates for RXT higher.
Status for each operation:
RXT1: The Ocean Pearl is now in dock preparing for the w ork in the North Sea and is ready to start operating in March/April. M/V Beulah Chouest rem ains stacked in the G ulf of Mexico (GoM) and the tim e charter expires in August 2010. The VS O OBC equipm ent is now being prepared to be deployed to the North Sea and will be used with the Ocean Pearl work this summer.
RXT2: Production from RXT2 in Nigeria is still running below revenue targets due to higher than planned downtime, m ostly on cable-, source- and recording equipment, The Sanco Spirit has replaced Ocean Pearl, which is a newly rigged vessel and better equipped with spares. In addition to the im plem entation of a new local purchasing process these m easures is expected to notably im prove the production in 2010.
RXT3: The seism ic equipm ent previously with crew RXT3 has been stored onshore in the Caspian region but is now being redeployed to the North Sea for the work awarded to Vikiand.
RXT4: The RXT4 crew arrived with Vikiand in Brazil on 13 Decem ber 2009 to support RXT5 operations, but could not start operating until February 2010 due to delays from the Brazilian authorities in granting necessary environmental permits.
RXT5: Production was considerably penalised in January due to both technical failures and lower cable handling speed in deep waters. Dow ntim e was due to operational problem s with cables and som e source equipm ent on deep water. The environm ental licence was obtained in beginning of February and the crew has now moved into shallower water and started to produce.
The technical issues associated with the deep w ater operation surfaced in late sum m er 2009. Since then the company has performed a number of tests to understand the nature of the problem. Currently the com pany is working in close collaboration with ION Geophysical (the equipm ent supplier) in order

to im prove the situation, and is confident that a solution can be deployed before RXT5 m oves back to deepwater. The unfinished work in the deepw ater section of the survey represents 5% of the overall contract value. The rem aining contract value is in shallow er waters.
Both RXT4 and RXT5 are now producing well on shallow water and will continue to do so until at least the end of Q1 2010. It is expected that RXT4 will sail back to the North Sea for the beginning of the acquisition season.
From a financial perspective, RXT has put renewed em phasis on cost control and reducing operating outlays. Cash flow m anagem ent will rem ain a key priority as the low production in Decem ber last year and in January 2010 has continued to im pact our ability to operate efficiently during the first part of the year.
Financials
In the following we will present you with the 31 Decem ber 2009 status of our financials, as well as an overview over our asset base and our liabilities;
RXT have had a strategy of investing in seism ic equipm ent and take in vessels on charter as opposed to take this on our balance sheet. The philosophy behind this has been to scale the business after the activity level, as well as limiting the investm ents needed for operations. Our total assets 31 December 2009 am ounted to USD 242.8 million, of which USD 166.8 million was related to investm ents in seism ic equipment. Our cash balance at 31 December 2009 was USD 6.9 million, while the accounts receivables amounted to USD 18.5 million.

Deferred tax asset The Com pany has tax reducing differences of USD 25.5 m illion in net losses and tax credits carried forward. In addition, the Com pany has substantial tax reducing tem porary differences related to seism ic equipment am ounting to approxim ately USD 32 million. Total net tem porary differences as of 31 Decem ber 2008 am ounted to 64.5 million (net tax reducing differences). The deferred tax asset is not recognized in the balance sheet.
Multi client library The carrying am ount of USD 12.6 million at 31 Decem ber 2009 represents the recognized value of the W est Cam eron project that was shot in October, Novem ber, and D ecem ber 2008, and January 2009.

Other intangible assets The carrying value of USD 0.8 million is capitalized developm ent costs related to the developm ent of EM-technology.
Seism ic equipm ent The total carrying am ount of USD 166.8 m illion consists of seism ic equipm ent related to the 5 crews (RXT1-RXT5) RXT had in operation at 31 Decem ber 2009 and capitalized rigging costs. It should be noted that RXT1 has been shut down in the beginning of 2009 and that RXT3 com pleted the CKNG contract at the end of May 2009 and has not secured any further work. The equipm ent related to RXT1 and RXT3 will be used in the in the surveys in the North Sea starting in 2Q10.

The total purchase price was USD 17.4 million. At 31 December 2008, the carrying am ount of the investm ent was written down to USD 6 m illion due to the current financial situation and uncertainty related to the timeline of the developm ent of cable based seafloor EM-technology and the eventual com m ercialization of the product. A preference share issue towards em ployees of KMS was carried out in March 2009 which reduced the RXT A SA ownership percentage down to 40 %.
Accounts receivable Accounts receivable consists of receivables from the current clients ExxonMobil and Petrobras.

Other current assets The USD 25.6 m illion consists of fuel inventory, prepaid expenses, deferred steaming expenses and deferred m obilization expenses.

Financial outlook for IQ 2010
The Com pany expects revenue o f USD 40 m illion and EBITDA of USD m inus 19 m illion in 1Q10. Net profit after tax is expected to com e in at USD m inus 38 million. The Com pany had only RXT2 operating in Nigeria in January, while from February both RXT4 and RXT5 were operating in Brazil in addition to RXT2 in Nigeria. The considerable net profit loss expected in 1Q10 (im pacting our book equity) further underlines the need for measures to improve our balance sheet,

Rationale behind proposal put forward to bondholders
The Company has an urgent liquidity need of approximately USD 50 million due to lack of production, the expiry of an overdraft facility not replaced, significant amounts of overdue bills to suppliers and weak near term cash flow generation. A solution involving a short term loan was initially envisaged; however the balance sheet deterioration experienced in 4Q09 and continuing into 1Q10 made it impossible to raise any debt to bridge the liquidity gap. A comprehensive debt restructuring/write off is considered needed in order to attract sufficient new equity capital to secure operations going forward and to honour the Company's future liabilities. The debt level is viewed too high compared to the operational leverage and risk profile of the Company. Should the proposal and a solution not be reached, the Board of Director of RXT will be forced to file for bankruptcy. Such a situation is unfortunately considered to provide a very low recovery value to all outstanding creditors in the Company.
Yours sincerely, Reservoir Exploration Technology ASA On behalf of the Board of Directors
Chairman
