To the holders :
ISIN: N0 001 079049.6 - Registered Rights issued upon conversion of bonds in the 10% IGas Energy Plc Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2013/2018 (ISIN NO 001 067379.1)
Information notice re. Conditional Secured Debt for Equity Swap
Reference is made to the summons to Bondholders' Meetings (the "Summons") that was issued on 17 March 2017 in respect of the above mentioned bond issue (the "Secured Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") issued by IGas Energy Plc (the "Issuer"), and the announcement on 3 April 2017 that the Proposal (as defined in the Summons) was approved by the bondholders' meeting of the Secured Bonds on 3 April 2017.
Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Summons, including its Annex 2 (Summary of Bondholders Transactions).
As previously announced by the Issuer and in addition to the shares issued under the Voluntary Equity Exchange, the holders of the Secured Bonds received New Ordinary Shares in the Issuer issued in the Conditional Secured Debt for Equity Swap. Secured Bonds with a face value of USD 11,081,609 (the "Conditional Conversion Bonds") were converted into 202,398,272 New Ordinary Shares of the Issuer under the Conditional Secured Debt for Equity Swap.
On 14 June 2017, at the Annual General Meeting of the Company a resolution was passed to effect a share consolidation and subdivision. As a result of this process the nominal value of the ordinary shares has changed from 0.0001p each to 0.002p each and the overall effect is that the shares have been consolidated on a 20 into 1 basis. As a result the new ordinary shares have new SEDOL and ISIN numbers as follows:
SEDOL: BZ042C2
ISIN: GB00BZ042C28
The EPIC Code remains "IGAS" and the shares continue to trade on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange plc. THIS CORPORATE ACTION DOES IMPACT THE EXCHANGE RATIOS ADVISED PREVIOUSLY.
Each holder of Registered Rights will now be entitled to receive a number of New Ordinary Shares determined by the following formula:
N = RR x TN / CCB
where
N = the number of New Ordinary Shares (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number of New Ordinary Shares)
RR = the number of Registered Rights delivered to the Paying Agent by the holder
TN = 10,119,914 (being the total number of New Ordinary Shares attributable to the exchange of the Conditional Conversion Bonds)
CCB = 11,081,609 (being the total number of Conditional Conversion Bonds)
