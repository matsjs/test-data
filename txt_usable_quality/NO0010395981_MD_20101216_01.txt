SDRL - Seadrill launches conversion incentive period for convertible bonds due 2012 and 2014
NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION TO ANY PERSON LOCATED OR RESIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES OR LOCATED IN THE REPUBLIC OF ITALY.
Hamilton, Bermuda, December 16, 2010 - Seadrill Limited ("Seadrill") announces a conversion incentive period for holders of up to US$250,000,000 of Seadrill's US$1,000,000,000 principal amount convertible bond ("Bonds 2012") due 2012, and for the entire Us $500,000,000 principal amount convertible bond ("Bonds 2014") due 2014, such Bonds issued pursuant to the loan agreements ("Loan Agreement") between Seadrill and Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, dated November 2, 2007 and dated September 29, 2009 respectively (the "Incentive Offers").
The acceptance period for the Incentive Offers is open until December 17, 2010 at 17:30 (CET) ("the Conversion Incentive Period").
Seadrill has engaged ABG Sundal Collier, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as managers (the "Managers") for the Incentive Offer.
The Seadrill share price has since June this year showed strong performance increasing from US$18.1 to US$33.4 at close of business yesterday. As such the current share price is materially higher than the strike price for conversion into equity of the convertible bonds due in 2012 and 2014. Based on the high likelihood of future conversion of these bonds, Seadrill has decided to offer an accelerated conversion to the bond holders. Seadrill has an optimistic view on the prospects of the offshore drilling industry. An accelerated conversion will increase our financial flexibility and strengthen our ability to undertake further investments whilst maintaining our dividend policy.
