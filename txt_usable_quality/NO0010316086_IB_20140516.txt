NORDIC TRUSTEE
To the bondholders in:
ISIN NO 001031608.6 - 9.75 per cent Petromena ASA Callable Bond Issue 2006/2012 (the "9.75% Bond Loan")
Oslo, 16 May 2014
Notice from Norwegian Securities Depository (the "VPS") - prolonged maturity date Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed as loan trustee for the holders of bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond loan. The Bondholders have from VPS received a notice regarding the upcoming maturity date for the 9.75% Bond Loan on 24 May 2014. The original maturity date was 24 May 2012, but the Bondholders have later - latest in a letter from the Loan Trustee dated 8 May 2013 - been informed that the maturity date has been prolonged. The entire 9.75% Bond Loan was on 3 April 2009 declared to be in default and due for immediate payment. Following the acceleration of the loan the Bondholders have received several payments. There will however not be made any payments to the Bondholders on the 24 May 2014. As there is expected that some further payments will be made to the Bondholders, the maturity date in VPS will - purely for practical reasons - be prolonged by 1 year - to 24 May 2015 (the "New Maturity Date"). In addition to facilitate future payments to the Bondholders, the extension of the maturity date will make trading and transactions connected to the bonds easier. When the New Maturity Date is approaching the Bondholders will probably receive a new notice from VPS. Further extension o f the maturity date will be considered on that point in time. Bondholders requesting further information may contact Nordic Trustee ASA.
Kind regards
Nordic Trustee ASA
