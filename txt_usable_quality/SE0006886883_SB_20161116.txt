All capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this notice shall have the meanings assigned to them in the terms and conditions of the Bonds (the "Terms and Conditions").
Holders participate by completing and sending the voting form, attached hereto as Schedule 1 (the "Voting Form"), and, if applicable, the power of attorney/authorisation, attached hereto as Schedule 2 (the "Power of Attorney") or other sufficient evidence, if the Bonds are held in custody other than by the CSD, to the Agent. Please contact the securities firm you hold your Bonds through if you do not know how your Bonds are registered or if you need authorisation or other assistance to participate.
The Agent must receive the Voting Form no later than 17:00 (CET) on 5 December 2016 either by mail, courier or email to the Agent using the contact details set out in Clause 4.7 (Address for sending replies) below. Votes received thereafter may be disregarded.
To be eligible to participate in the Written Procedure, a person must meet the criteria for being a Holder on 23 November 2016 (the "Record Date"). This means that the person must be registered on a Securities Account with the CSD, as a direct registered owner (Sw. direktregistrerad ägare) or authorised nominee (Sw. förvaltare) with respect to one or several Bonds.

This Notice has been prepared solely by the Issuer and, as the case may be, its advisors. The Agent expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. Background
1.1 By a contract note dated 22 February 2015, as amended by way of an amendment and waiver agreement dated 26 February 2015 (the "Contract Note"), between Hogkammen AB ("Parent") (as purchaser) and Bergteamet Holding AB (publ) ("Bergteamet Holding") (as seller), the shares of the Issuer (the "Shares") was purchased by Parent from Bergteamet Holding in connection with the enforcement actions taken in February 2015 under a share pledge agreement dated 9 September 2013 which became enforceable as a result of certain events under the up to SEK 700,000,000 Senior Secured Callable Bonds 2013/2018 with ISIN SE0005364411 issued by Bergteamet Holding on 9 September 2013 (the "Previous Bonds"). The Issuer has executed an acknowledgement in respect of its rights under the Contract Note.
1.2 The purchase price for the Shares was paid in part by the Parent by issuing a promissory note to the Agent in the amount of SEK 100,000,000. The promissory note was subsequently settled by way of transferring the Bonds, which the Parent had initially subscribed for, to the Agent (for subsequent distribution to the Holders'), in each case in accordance with the terms of the Contract Note.
1.3 The remaining part of the subscription price of SEK 200,000,000 for the Bonds that Parent initially subscribed for shall, according to the terms of the Contract Note, be paid in cash by Parent to the Issuer in two instalments.
1.4 The first instalment amounting to SEK 40,000,000 was paid by Parent to the Issuer in connection with the transfer of the Shares to Parent.
1.5 Under the terms of the Contract Note, the Parent shall pay the second instalment amounting to SEK 60,000,000 (the "Second Instalment") no later than within sixty (60) days after the date when it has been concluded by the relevant parties that Bergteamet Holding in bankruptcy has no claims on the Issuer and/or Parent (such date being the "Payment Trigger"). The Issuer and the Agent agree that the Payment Trigger has occurred.
1.6 Upon completion of payment of the Second Instalment in full, the Agent shall release the security granted over the Shares pursuant to the Terms and Conditions and the Share Pledge Agreement.
1.7 Notwithstanding the circumstances set out in Clause 1.5, the Issuer requests in Clause 2.1 (Request for Consent) below that the Holders shall consent to amend the Contract Note so that the Parent's obligation to make the payment of the Second Instalment shall become due on the earlier to occur of the written demand by the Issuer and 22 February 2019.
1.8 The reason for the request by the Issuer is that the cash proceeds of the Second Instalment is not needed at the moment in the business of the Issuer and the Issuer has further no reason to believe that it will not be able to meet its payment obligations under the Bonds. The positive cash balance of the Issuer exceeds the amount needed for working capital. In the Issuer's opinion, the pledge over the Shares, which will remain in place until the Second Instalment has been made in full, will be more beneficial to the
2 (9)

Holders compared to the cash injection which results from the payment of the Second Instalment.
1.9 The Contract Note is not a Finance Document as defined in the Terms and Conditions. However, since this is a matter that relates to the Bonds and the Finance Documents and since the Agent is unable to grant any waiver in this respect without the prior consent of the Holders, the Issuer is hereby initiating a Written Procedure to seek the Holders' consent as described in Clause 2.1 (Requestfor Consents).
1.10 Further, as a consequence of the Contract Note not being designated as a Finance Document, any breach of the terms of the Contract Note is not an Event of Default under the Terms and Conditions.
1.11 In addition, pursuant to Condition 11.2 of the Terms and Conditions, the Issuer (or any Group Company), may not purchase Bonds. The Issuer is now seeking the consent of the Holders to purchase Bonds in the market as further described in Clause 2.2 (Request for Consents).
2. Request for Consent
2.1 For the reason set out in Clause 1.7, we kindly ask the Holders to agree to amend the Contract Note as follows: The Parent shall make the payment of the Second Instalment on the earlier to occur of (i) written demand by the Issuer and (ii) 22 February 2019. The Issuer undertakes to make a written demand for payment of the Second Instalment no later than 22 February 2019 or, if earlier, if (in the opinion of the Issuer) there is a liquidity need in the Issuer ("Consent A").
The Shares will continue to be pledged to the Holders under the Share Pledge Agreement until the earlier of the Second Instalment has been made in full and the Bonds have been repaid in full.
The amendment to the Contract Note as described in this Clause 2.1 shall take effect on the date of expiry of the voting period, provided sufficient majority is obtained.
2.2 In addition, we kindly ask the Holders to agree to amend the Terms and Conditions to the effect that the Issuer and any Group Company are permitted to purchase Bonds. Consequently, the Issuer is seeking the agreement of the Holders to amend the Terms and Conditions by deleting Condition 11.2 in its entirety ("Consent B").
The amendment to the Terms and Conditions as described in this Clause 2.2 shall take effect on the date of expiry of the voting period, provided sufficient majority is obtained.
2.3 Consent A and Consent B are jointly referred to as the "Consents".
3. Non-reliance
The request for Consents is presented to the Holders by the Issuer, without any evaluation, advice or recommendations from the Agent whatsoever. No independent advisor has been appointed to review and/or analyse the requests (and their effects) from the Holders' perspective. The Holders are recommended to seek legal advice to independently evaluate whether the requests from the Issuer (and their effects) are acceptable or not.

4. Written Procedure
The following instructions need to be adhered to under the Written Procedure.
4.1 Final date to participate in the Written Procedure
The Agent must have received the votes by mail, courier or email to the address indicated below no later than 17:00 (CET), 5 December 2016. Votes received thereafter may be disregarded.
4.2 Decision procedure
The Agent will determine if received replies are eligible to participate under the Written Procedure as valid votes.
Holders may vote to approve one of the Consents but not the other Consent. Refusal to approve one of the Consents shall not effect the validity of an approval of the other Consent.
When a requisite majority of consents of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount have been received by the Agent in respect of one of the Consents, that Consent shall be deemed to be given, even if the time period for replies in the Written Procedure has not yet expired.
Information about the decision taken under the Written Procedure will: i) be sent by notice to the Holders and ii) be published on the websites of a) the Issuer and b) the Agent.
A matter decided under the Written Procedure will be binding for all Holders, irrespective of them responding in the Written Procedure.
4.3 Voting rights and authorisation
Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on the Record Date (23 November 2016) in the debt register:
(a) be registered as a direct registered owner of a Securities Account; or
(b) be registered as authorised nominee in a Securities Account, with respect to one or several Bonds.
4.4 Bonds registered with a nominee
If you are not registered as a direct registered owner, but your Bonds are held through a registered authorised nominee or another intermediary, you may have two different options to influence the voting for the Bonds.
1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.
2. You can obtain a Power of Attorney (Schedule 2) from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own Voting Form based on the authorisation. If you hold your Bonds through several intermediaries, you need
4 (9)

to obtain authorisation directly from the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as Holder of the Securities Account, or from each intermediary in the chain of Holders, starting with the intermediary that is registered in the debt register as a Holder of the Securities Account as authorised nominee or direct registered owner.
Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).
The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Bonds are registered or need authorisation or other assistance to participate. Bonds owned by a Group Company or an Affiliate do not entitle to any voting rights.
4.5 Quorum
To grant the Consents, Holders representing at least twenty (20) per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount must reply to the request under the Written Procedure in order to form a quorum.
If a quorum does not exist, the Agent shall initiate a second Written Procedure, provided that the relevant proposal has not been withdrawn by the Issuer. No quorum requirement will apply tosuch second Written Procedure.
4.6 Majority
Fifty (50) per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Holders reply under the Written Procedure must vote in favour of the request for each Consent.
4.7 Address for sending replies
Return the Voting Form, Schedule 1, and, if applicable, the Power of Attorney/Authorisation in Schedule 2 or other sufficient evidence, if the Bonds are held in custody other than Euroclear Sweden, by regular mail, scanned copy by e-mail, or by courier to:
