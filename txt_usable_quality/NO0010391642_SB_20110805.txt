where Sevan Marine ASA (the "Issuer") is the issuer (each from (i) through (v) above a "Bond Issue").
Unless otherwise defined herein, or the context otherwise requires, capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the respective loan agreements for the Bond Issues between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee (for and on behalf of the Bondholders in each Bond Issue) (each a "Bond Loan Agreement" and together, the "Bond Loan Agreements").
The information in this summons regarding the legal, operational and financial status o f the Issuer is provided by the Issuer. The Bond Trustee expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever related to such information given from the Issuer.

visit the Issuer's website www.sevanmarine.com. As announced, the Issuer is and has for some time been facing a critical liquidity situation and further needs to implement a global financial restructuring to facilitate continued operations of the Issuer and its subsidiaries on a going concern basis.
In particular, for the last several weeks, the Issuer has been in ongoing discussions with the Bond Trustee and legal and financial professional advisers retained to represent the Bond Trustee and the interests of the Bondholders (the "Bondholder Advisers"), regarding the Issuer's financial predicament. This has involved the Bondholder Advisers coordinating with an informal group of approximately 13 institutions that are understood to be the largest Bondholders across all series of the Bond Issues, holding in excess of 40% of the nominal amount of the Issuer's Bonds. The Issuer is also engaged in discussions with representatives of its other major creditors and stakeholders. All major stakeholders have indicated to the Issuer that they strongly prefer to see a financially restructured Issuer and a continuation of its business.
The Issuer is currently working to agree a long-term restructuring solution (the "Restructuring"). This will, among other things, include the completion of a business plan, and completion of an assessment of the costs and timing to complete the Voyageur FPSO upgrade project. It is expected that this work will be completed during the course of the summer. With these requirements completed, the Issuer believes it will be well placed to finalise the terms of its Restructuring with its major stakeholders with a view to an initial completion of the Restructuring by 30 September 2011, although final completion and implementation of all aspects may extend into October 2011.This timeline is supported by the Issuer's advisers and the Bondholder Advisers.
As a first step to address the Issuer's short term liquidity situation, on 19 July 2011 the Issuer entered into a bond loan agreement (the "Bridge Facility Agreement") for a short-term bridge loan in the nominal amount of USD 36,100,000 (the "Bridge Loan"). In this respect, see the Issuer's announcement dated 20 July 2011 attached to this summons as Appendix 2. The proceeds from the Bridge Loan will, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, be applied (i) in an amount of at least USD 30,000,000 to pay necessary capital expenditures in relation to the upgrade project for the Voyageur FPSO and (ii) with the remainder providing for working capital for continued operations of the Issuer and its subsidiaries. The Bridge Loan will be secured by a pledge over the Issuer's shares in Sevan Drilling ASA, in respect of which a release from the lock-up arrangements agreed at the time of the Sevan Drilling IPO has been secured.
In addition, the Issuer requires a deferral of interest that is currently due on the Unsecured Bonds, as well as the interest that will become due on certain of its other Bond Issues through 30 September 2011 in order to maintain adequate operating liquidity. Accordingly, the Issuer has requested the Bond Trustee to convene a Bondholders' meeting for each Bond Issue in order to seek formal consents and waivers to these interest deferrals, and agree to standstill terms which will facilitate the discussions with major stakeholders and the proposed Restructuring process. Bondholders holding in excess of 55.1% of the Bonds have expressly confirmed and agreed that they will support the resolutions proposed below in this summons.
2 PROPOSAL

As described in the Q1 2011 report and the accompanying press release dated 14 June 2011, the Company is in the process of seeking a financial restructuring, including a restructuring of its debt.
The Company is in a constructive dialogue with its lenders, including the bondholders. While no assurance can yet be given as to the outcome of these. discussions, bondholders representing more than 2/3 of the votes in the NOK 700 million senior unsecured bond issue (ISIN NO 001 059362.7) have instructed the Trustee (Norsk Tillitsmann) to accept an extended grace period for payment of the interest payment due 22 June, until 22 July 2011, in order for the Company to develop a new financial plan and improve a constrained short term liquidity situation. Accordingly, and subject to any subsequent revocation or withdrawal of such consent, the Trustee has today confirmed the acceptance of the extended grace period.
The Company and its subsidiaries continue to explore viable solutions, including measures to address the immediate liquidity needs. The Company currently believes a solution in principle must be agreed with relevant stakeholders during the first half of July.
The Company continues its assessment of the FPSO Voyageur upgrade in consultation with its customer with a view to determining detailed impact on final cost and delivery schedule.

SEVAN MARINE ASA: CONTINUING DIALOGUE FOR LONG-TERM SOLUTION, FINANCIAL UPDATE AND FPSO SEVAN VOYAGEUR COST INCREASE

The Board of Directors of Sevan Marine ASA (the "Company") continues to hold constructive dialogue with bondholders and other relevant parties regarding a global restructuring of the Company's balance sheet. In particular, the Board is in dialogue with the advisors to Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the bond trustee for the Company's bond issues) and an informal group of the Company's largest bondholders. The dialogue with the bondholder group regarding a global restructuring currently assumes that the restructuring would involve:
* a full equitisation of the Company's existing unsecured bonds;
* a partial but reasonably material equitisation of each of the series of the
Company's existing secured bonds; * a corresponding substantial dilution of the Company's existing shareholders; * a capital raise for the Company, likely in the form of new equity, currently
estimated to be at least USD 200 million, to be funded primarily by
bondholders, but with a right for existing shareholders to participate;
* extension of maturities for the Company's existing secured bonds; and
* a revision of interest rates and amortization schedules of the Company's
secured bonds to correspond with the Company's cash flow profile and debt
service capacity.
The above assumptions, and the detailed terms and conditions of a global

1

Utskriftsdato 11.7.2011

restructuring proposal, remain to be finally determined and negotiated, and will, inter alia, be affected by the contents of a revised business plan currently being prepared by the Company, and the final cost estimate and schedule developments for the FPSO Sevan Voyageur upgrade project. Any global restructuring proposal will be subject to obtaining necessary agreements with, and consents from, the Company's bondholders, shareholders and other key stakeholders and counterparties to the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Company continues to be under serious short term liquidity pressure, and the Board is currently in discussions regarding bridge financing of at least USD 35 million. Further, the Company intends to request deferrals of interest payments due under the relevant bond loans up to at least end of September 2011, and bondholders who have been approached on a confidential basis have expressed their support in principle to such proposal. The Board is optimistic that its short-term liquidity issues will be resolved and that a long term solution to the financial challenges facing the Company can be obtained by the end of September 2011.
As for the FPSO Sevan Voyageur upgrade project, further detailed project reviews and assessments have identified additional costs to be incurred by the Company, resulting in a current cost estimate for the project in the range of USD 160-170 million. The increase from the previously announced cost estimate of USD 135 million is mainly a result of time related costs due to additional delays, certain increased procurement costs for equipment, yard services and additional contingencies. First oil is currently expected to take place during the second quarter of 2012. The review is ongoing in close cooperation with the charterer.
The Company's financial situation remains challenging. In connection with the ongoing processes, renewed scrutiny and assessment of booked assets has been required. The Board has initiated a process to impairment test the Company's asset base, which is expected to result in substantial write downs in the closing of half-year accounts of 2011.
Notwithstanding the ongoing dialogue with lenders, FPSO Sevan Voyageur stakeholders and others, no assurance can be given that a viable global solution can be found in a timely manner, falling which the Board will be required to file for bankruptcy.
