To the Bondholders in:
ISIN SE0006593992 - Estancia Logistik AB (publ)
Stockholm, 9 July 2015
NOTICE
This notice (the "Notice") has been sent on 9 July 2015 to the Bondholders registered in the debt register (Sw. skuldebok) kept by Euroclear Sweden AB.
Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) (the "Agent") is under the Terms and Conditions appointed as Agent for the above mentioned bond issue where Estancia Logistik AB (publ) is the issuer.
All capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Terms and Conditions.
This Notice is sent due to the fact that two of the Guarantors whose shares have been pledged in favour of the Bondholders, Krossen Fastighets AB and Estancia Logistik Vinsta AB, merged on 23 June 2015 and Krossen Fastighets AB has ceased to exist. The merger is formally not in compliance with the share pledge agreement regarding the shares in Krossen Fastighets AB, however the merger is not detrimental to the Bondholders since all assets and liabilities of Krossen Fastighets AB have been transferred to the surviving company, Estanica Logistik Vinsta AB, which is also a Guarantor and which shares are pledged in favour of the Bondholders.
The Agent has agreed to waive the breach of the share pledge agreement since the merger does not have a detrimental effect to the interest of the Bondholders.
NORDIC TRUSTEE & AGENCY AB (PUBL)
As Agent
