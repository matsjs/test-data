BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF PROPOSAL

Following approval by the Bondholders of the Restructuring at the Bondholders' Meeting held 6 August 2015, the Issuer has been focused on satisfying the conditions precedent (as outlined in the July Summons) to facilitate implementation of the Restructuring.

In Iona's Q2 2015 results presentation (slide 7), three key risks were highlighted with regard the Restructuring:

· Oil price. · Farm-in Partner consent to the Orlando Farm-Out. · Atlantic Petroleum funding.

The Issuer has sought to protect itself against oil price risks via the October Summons, which proposed that the Issuer deferred payment of the USD 24 million Restricted Cash Repayment to provide the Issuer with additional working capital headroom to fund Orlando capital expenditures.

However, there remains uncertainty with regard to both the Farm-in Partner and Atlantic Petroleum that means further time is required to finalise certain of the documentation. Accordingly, to facilitate completion of the conditions precedent to the Restructuring, the Issuer is proposing an extension of the Long Stop Date from 30 November 2015 to 15 January 2016.

The Bondholders' Meeting held on 6 August 2015 agreed that its approval of the Proposal (as defined in the July Summons) satisfied the TP Covenant, subject to the condition that the Restructuring Implementation Date has occurred on or before 30 September 2015. The Bondholders' Meeting held 30 September then agreed that the TP Covenant shall be satisfied if the Restructuring Implementation Date has occurred on or before 30 November 2015. As a consequence of the proposal to amend the Long Stop Date from 30 November to 15 January 2016, the Issuer is also proposing that the TP Covenant is amended so that it shall be satisfied if the Restructuring Implementation Date has occurred by 15 January 2016.

3. PROPOSAL

Based on the above, the Issuer hereby proposes certain amendments to the terms of the Restructuring approved by the Bondholders' Meeting held 6 August 2015, as amended by the Bondholders' Meetings held on 30 September 2015 and 13 October 2015, respectively (the "Proposal"):

3.1 Extension of the Long Stop Date The Long Stop Date shall be extended from 30 November 2015 to 15 January 2016.

3.2 Transaction Proposal Covenant
In line with the extension of the Long Stop Date to 15 January 2016, the Issuer proposes that the TP Covenant shall be satisfied if the Restructuring Implementation Date has occurred on or before 15 January 2016, provided that if the Restructuring Implementation Date has not so occurred on or before 15 January 2016, then the TP Covenant shall be deemed not to have been satisfied such that there will be an Event of Default under the Bond Agreement due to a breach of the TP Covenant.

To approve the Proposal, Bondholders representing at least 2/3 of the Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the meeting must vote in favour of the resolution, hi order to have a quorum, at least 5/10 of the voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting. If the Proposal is not adopted, the terms of the Restructuring initially approved by the Bondholders' Meeting held 6 August 2015, as amended by the Bondholders' Meetings held on 30 September 2015 and 13 October 2015, respectively, will remain unchanged. Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and o f the voting rights at the Bondholders' Meeting. If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered. The individual Bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising the Bond Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details). In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' Meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds. For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' Meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond Trustee, to notify the Bond Trustee by telephone or by email (www.mail@trustee.no) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
