Furthermore, based on a summons to a Bondholders' meeting sent out 25 June 2009 only related to the USD 175 million Bond, the Bondholders have approved a further deferral of the interest payments until 6 July 2009.
Over the last weeks there have been constructive discussions and meetings between the Company, the Bondholders in the Bonds (including their legal and financial advisers Bingham and AMA, respectively) and the lenders under the bank facility (the "Banks") in order to seek an acceptable solution to the challenges that Nexus and its stakeholders are facing. Despite this, additional time is needed as no solution has yet been agreed. Therefore, the Banks have agreed with the Loan Trustee and the Company to further extend its stand-still agreement and thereby not treating Nexus as being in default in this period, the Banks are releasing the required funds to finance the operational expense for the Company until 15 July 2009, and that the Banks are agreeing to continue its discussions with the Bondholders Committee. Based on this, the Company summons a Bondholders' meeting asking the Bondholders in the Bonds to further defer the interest payments.
The Proposal
The Company proposes the following (the "Proposal"):
For the USD 175 million Bond: · The interest payments originally due 7 June 2009, and deferred to 6 July 2009, to be further
deferred until 17 July 2009, subject to (a) the Banks not treating Nexus as being in default in this period, (b) the Banks are releasing the required funds to finance the operational expense for the Company until 15 July 2009, and (c) that the Banks are agreeing to continue its discussions with the Bondholders Committee.
For the USD 75 million convertible Bond: · The interest payments originally due 25 June 2009, and deferred to 9 July 2009, to be further
deferred until 21 July 2009, subject to (a) the Banks not treating Nexus as being in default in this period, (b) the Banks are releasing the required funds to finance the operational expense for the Company until 15 July 2009, and (c) that the Banks are agreeing to continue its discussions with the Bondholders Committee.
Evaluation of the Proposal NTM puts the request forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendation, and amplifies that each Bondholder cast its vote on the Bondholders' meeting based on its own judgement.
