Pressrelease I19nDfoecremmbear,ti2o0n13 to holders of bonds in Index International AB (publ)'s Swedish bond loan
Index Equity Sweden AB ("Index E quity"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Index International AB (publ) (the "Com pany"), has entered into a factoring agreement with one of Index Equity's associated companies (the "A ssociated Com pany"), pursuant to which Index Equity provides a working capital credit facility in a maximum aggregate amount of MSEK 20 to the Associated Company, secured by pledges in certain of the Associated Company's (and its subsidiaries') accounts receivables (the "T ra n sa ction "). The Transaction is positive for Index Equity and thereby also for the Company, according to the Company and Index Equity. As the Associated Company is not a subsidiary to the Company, the Transaction is not in compliance with the undertaking made under the Company's bond loan (ISIN: SE0005250529) (the "B o n d s") about not granting any loans to any companies outside the company group. The Company's main shareholders, Bjarne Borg M anagement AB and Fredrik Alama Management AB, has therefore joint and severally undertaken to keep Index Equity indemnified for and from all possible losses (including any non payment) by reason of the Transaction and to acquire Index Equity's claim in the Transaction to nominal amount if an Event of Default were to occur in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Bonds. Considering the above, Swedish Trustee AB (publ), bond trustee in the bond loan, has granted the Company a waiver for the Transaction in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Bonds.
