To the bondholders in:

ISIN NO 001060119.8 11.75 per cent. Dannemora Mineral AB Callable Senior Secured Bond Issue 2011/2016

Oslo, 24 September 2013
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting regarding request for a temporary waiver of the interest coupon payment obligation and the Minimum Liquidity covenant in the Bond Agreement

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds (the "Bonds") in the above mentioned issue with ISIN NO001 060119.8 (the "Bond Issue") issued by Dannemora Mineral AB ("Dannemora" or the "Company").
Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 18 March 2011 (the "Bond Agreement").
The information in this summons regarding the Company and market conditions is provided by the Company, and NTM expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. Introduction and Background
1.1 Operational Update
The Company has initiated a number of activities to reduce costs and accelerate long term cost level improvements including, but not limited to, in-sourcing of core mine activities from sub-contractors. In addition, process plant performance has been significantly improved since the June Phase 1 investment, which was conducted on time and on budget, yielding an average recovery of approximately 40 per cent. (June to date). In combination, this has created a foundation for improved operational performance, with close to positive EBITDA levels reached momentarily in August. Furthermore, both suppliers and customers have been supportive to the Company and, for the most part, provided tangible support by for example allowing prolonged payment terms or increased number of monthly shipments. Albeit having substantially improved the short-term liquidity situation through these and other activities, the Company cannot reach a sufficient level of long-term operational efficiency and cash flow without considerable investments, primarily in the process plant (Phase 2) and in the mine (Hoist).

1.2 Financial Update
Based on the current cash-flow, the Company is not able to pay the interest falling due for payment in respect of the Bonds on 22 September 2013, as required by clause 9 of the Bond Agreement (the "22 September Interest Payment"). Failure to satisfy the 22 September Interest Payment constitutes an Event of Default under clause 15.2(a) of the Bond Agreement.
Additionally, for the reasons explained in the summons dated 22 July 2013, the Company has breached the minimum liquidity covenant in Clause 13.5(f) of the Bond Agreement (which requires that the Company maintains a minimum Liquidity (as defined in the Bond Agreement) of SEK 50 million at all times) (the "Minimum Liquidity Covenant") on 16 August 2013. The Bondholders' Meeting authorised NTM to grant a temporary waiver of the Minimum Liquidity Covenant on 5 August 2013. In accordance with the terms of the Summons dated 22 July 2013, such temporary waiver of the Minimum Liquidity Covenant expires on 22 September 2013 (at the latest). The decline in the recovery in May 2013 has compromised the Company's ability to achieve a positive EBITDA for the rest of the financial year. Although this situation does not necessitate any adjustment to the production estimate for the rest of the year, the variations in run-of-mine (ROM) iron content and recovery create some ongoing uncertainty about production volumes going forward, which in turn means a continuing and increased uncertainty regarding the estimated cash flow for the future. Therefore, the Company is likely to continue to breach the Minimum Liquidity Covenant.
1.3 Strategic Review
As previously reported, the Company has been working with various advisers (Swedbank First Securities as the Company's financial adviser, Recore AS as its Chief Restructuring Officer, Roschier Advokatbyrå AB as its legal adviser and Graneli to assist with financial topics, primarily modelling) to assess its financial and legal position and evaluate potential restructuring and refinancing options with a view to addressing its current financial difficulties for the benefit of its stakeholders as a whole (the implementation of any such option being a "Restructuring", evidenced by a "Restructuring Term Sheet"). The Company is continuing discussions with its shareholders, holders of 11.75 per cent, convertible bonds 2012/2015 issued by the Company (the "Convertible Bonds", the holders of such Convertible Bonds together being the "Convertible Bondholders"), trade partners and Bondholders to pursue viable options regarding a Restructuring. However, any such Restructuring solution has not been able to be implemented before the 22 September Interest Payment became due and payable.
1.4 The Bondholder Committee
As previously notified to the Bondholders generally, a group of the largest Bondholders holding approximately 65 % of the principal amount outstanding of the Bonds have formed themselves into an informal ad hoc committee of Bondholders (the "Committee") for the purpose of engaging with the Company in connection with a potential Restructuring.

With the support of the Committee, NTM has, as previously reported, retained Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP ("Bingham") as its lead legal counsel (for and on behalf of the Bondholders). NTM has further engaged The Blackstone Group International Partners LLP ("Blackstone") as its financial adviser and Advokatfirman Vinge KB ("Vinge", and together with Bingham and Blackstone the "NTM Advisers") as its Swedish legal counsel (in each case, for and on behalf of the Bondholders) and may engage further local counsel in relevant jurisdictions if necessary. Bondholders may contact Blackstone and Bingham using the following details:
Bingham: Margaret M urray-Tel: +44 20 7661 5478 Email: margaret.murray@bingham.com
Blackstone: Pavlin Kumchev - Tel: +44 20 7104 4708 Email: Pavlin.Kumchev@Blackstone.com
1.5 Request for waiver
Dannemora hereby requests, subject to the Waiver Conditions (as defined below), that the Bondholders temporarily waive:
(i) the requirement in clause 9 of the Bond Agreement to satisfy the 22 September Interest Payment; and
(ii) the Minimum Liquidity Covenant
(together, the "Waiver").
Notwithstanding the granting of the Waiver, the unpaid 22 September Interest Payment shall bear interest from 22 September 2013 (being the date on which the interest falls due for payment in respect of the Bonds) at an interest rate equivalent to the interest rate set out in Clause 9 of the Bond Agreement plus 5% per annum, as required by Clause 11.4 of the Bond Agreement.
1.6 Conditions Precedent to the Waiver
The effectiveness of the Waiver will be subject to NTM's determination, in its sole discretion, that the following matters have been satisfied by the date of the Bondholders' Meeting referred to in Section 4 below:
(a) no member of the Group having entered into any bankruptcy, reconstruction, liquidation, administration, receivership or any other insolvency procedure (or any analogous proceeding in any other jurisdiction), whether voluntary or involuntary;

It is proposed that the Bondholders' Meeting resolve the following:
"The Bondholders approve the Waiver (subject to the Waiver Conditions) and the exercise of NTM's Discretion, each as described in section 2 of the summons for the Bondholders' Meeting.
The Bondholders further authorise NTM to enter into such agreements and documents, consent to such waivers and amendments, take any actions and do ail such things on behalf of the Bondholders as may be necessary or desirable to support or give effect to the Waiver and the Waiver Conditions and the exercise of NTM's Discretion, including, without limitation, amending and/or waiving the terms of the Bond Agreement and/or the other Finance Documents."
To approve the above resolution, Bondholders representing more than 66% per cent, of the Voting Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the meeting for the Bonds must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to have a quorum, at least 5/10 of the Voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting.

Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' Meeting.

The individual Bondholder may authorise NTM to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising NTM to vote, must then be returned to NTM promptly before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post to post@trustee.no, +47 22 87 94 10, or Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, PO Box 1470 Vika, 0116 Oslo, Norway).
