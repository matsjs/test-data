DigiPlex
DigiPlex Norway AS (the Company) Board of Directors' report
For the year ended 31 December 2016
Registration no. 981 663 322
We are pleased to present the 2016 annual financial report for the Company.
BACKGROUND
DigiPlex Norway AS forms part of the privately-owned DigiPlex Group of Companies, which specialises in building and operating data centres in the Nordic region. Founded in 2002, the Group is one of the longest standing data centre builders and operators in Europe, with companies registered in Finland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The Group provides safe, secure and future ready IT housing for our customers' mission critical systems. This is not a one-size-fitsall service but one that is tailored to suit each customer's individual needs.
The Company operates from a facility at Selma Ellefsens vei 1, 0581 Oslo, Norway (formerly Ulvenveien 89B). The facility houses a large range of clients from various sectors including the government, telecommunications and corporates.
BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Throughout 2016 the Company has continued investing in and operating from the facility at Selma Ellefsens vei 1 in Oslo providing a secure IT Housing service for its clients.
REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS
As at the date of this report, the Board is not aware of any current, or potential regulatory/political changes that may cause any risk to the operations of the Company.
GOING CONCERN
As at the date of this report, the Board do not have any reason to believe that either the Company's external bond holders or its shareholders do not support the going concern of the Company.
The bond loan agreement provides that the quantum of any dividends or loan repayments to the parent is limited to NOK 20 million per year, and is subject to minimum liquidity requirements, on a combined basis with DigiPlex Rosenholm AS. An amount of NOK 20 million was distributed via a loan to the shareholder in 2016.
Further, the bond agreement permitted the advance of NOK 20 million (net) to DigiPlex Rosenholm AS, a related party. The bond agreement is partly guaranteed by DigiPlex Rosenholm AS.
The Board is of the opinion that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the activities of the Company.
FUTURE READY IT-HOUSIIMG

DigiPlex
In accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act section 3-3, the Board confirms that the conditions for continued operations as a going concern are present for the Company and that the annual financial statements have been prepared under this presumption.
INCOME STATEMENT AND STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
The Directors have noted that market conditions are good, and that the data centre has sufficient flow of new customers and renewal of contracts.
The enclosed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS").
Operating revenues totalled NOK 143.3 million (2015: NOK 126.7 million), an increase of 13.1%.
Operating expenses (excluding depreciation) totalled NOK 77.7 million (2015: NOK 69.8 million), which comprised of NOK 13.2 million in cost of goods sold, NOK 26.7 million of employee costs and NOK 37.8 million of other operating costs.
EBITDA totalled NOK 65.6 million (2015: NOK 56.9 million), an increase of 15.3%. The EBITDA margin for 2016 was 45.8% (2015: 44.9%).
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment totalled NOK 42.0 million (2015: NOK 40.4 million).
In light of the above, the operating profit for 2016 come in at NOK 23.6 million (2015: NOK 16.5 million). The increase compared to 2015 was mainly due to incremental increases in certain customer contracts.
Net finance costs were NOK 23.2 million (2015: NOK 18.3 million). This increase was due to a full year of interest cost on the amount of NOK 575.0 million of bonds issued in July 2015.
The profit before income tax was NOK 0.4 million (2015: loss of NOK 1.8 million). The tax charge came in at NOK 2.0 million (2015: NOK 3.3 million), due to the effect of the announced reduction of applicable corporate tax rate from 25% to 24%, resulting in a loss for the year of NOK 1.6 million (2015: loss of NOK 5.1 million).
Total assets were NOK 702.5 million (2015: NOK 700.4 million).
The Company continues to explore innovative methods and refining its technology to ensure it keeps its customers future ready.
Notwithstanding the above expectation, the future is not predictable and ultimately no warranties can be made by the Board in relation to the performance of the Company in 2017.
CAPITAL AND FINANCING
Net cash outflow for the year was NOK 7.5 million (2015: inflow of NOK 18.2 million). Cash inflow from operating activities amounted to NOK 68.4 million (2015: NOK 63.6 million). Cash outflow to investing activities amounted to NOK 47.9 million (2015: NOK 160.1 million), whereof loans to

DigiPlex
related companies account for NOK 40.0 million. Cash outflow from financing activities amounted to NOK 28.0 million (2015: cash inflow of NOK 114.7 million). A detailed cash flow statement is included in the financial statements.
The difference between operating results and cash flow from operating activities, mainly relates to depreciation, financial items and change in trade and other payables. The Company's investments are financed primarily via its bond issue.
The Company has raised NOK 575.0 million from issuing bonds. The bonds were issued in July 2015 to refinance its existing bank and shareholder loans. These bonds were listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in January 2016. The bonds are due to mature in July 2019. The Company may redeem these bonds in part or in full, in accordance with the terms of the Bond Agreement.
The Company is making interest payments to the bondholders in accordance with the Bond Agreement.
As noted above, a loan advance to the Company's parent was made in 2016 in the amount of NOK 20 million. This loan was made within the parameters of the Bond Agreement.
Further, a further loan advance in the amount of NOK 20 million (net) was made to DigiPlex Rosenholm AS, a related party in accordance with the terms of the Bond Agreement.
The Board is confident that the current financial resources available to the Company are adequate for its existing requirements.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Company's governance systems are based on principles set out in the Norwegian Code of Conduct for Corporate Governance with the aim to benefit long-term value creation for shareholders, employees and society at large.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board ensures that the Company has good internal control functions and appropriate systems for risk management tailored to its operations and in accordance with the Company's core values, ethical guidelines and social responsibility policy. The Board, at a minimum, on an annual basis conducts a review of the Company's most important risk areas and its internal control functions.
This position is in compliance with Bond Rules section 2.5 and the Stock Exchange Regulations section 1 (2).
RISKS
The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks namely; market risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Company's financial performance. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge any risk exposures.

DigiPlex
Risk management is carried out by the Company's finance department under policies approved by the Board. The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
Market risk The Company operates nationally and is therefore exposed to a limited foreign exchange risk.
However, its interest rate risk arises from a long-term bond loan (see note 12). Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk. The interest on the loan is adjusted quarterly. The Company also holds loans to related companies. These loans issued at variable rates in accordance with the long-term bond loan.
Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis At 31 December 2016, if the Norwegian key policy rate had been 10 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been NOK 600,000 higher/lower, mainly as a result of higher/lower interest expense on Bond borrowings.
Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. Management assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. Credit risk related to bank insolvency is closely monitored.
Liquidity risk The Company's finance department monitors rolling forecasts of the Company's liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs, while maintaining sufficient headroom at all times so that the Company does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.
The Board is not aware of any additional financial risk factors facing the Company other than those outlined in this report.
HEALTH, SAFETY AND WORK ENVIRONMENT
As of 31 December 2016, the Company employed 26 full time staff, made up of 8 females and 18 males. One of those male employees was in a leading management position as the Chief Executive Officer. The Company gives equal opportunities to its employees regardless of gender and will continue this policy in the future.
The Company's ambition is to conduct its operations with zero injuries through effective risk management. The Company considers the working environment as positive and there have been no serious work incidents or accidents resulting in personal injury or damages to material or equipment during the course of 2016. The Company also maintains a log of sick leave days taken. The absence percentage due to sick leave for 2016 was 3.0%.
All employees are part of a pension scheme.

DigiPlex
EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
Within our environmental impact it is energy use and consequently carbon emissions that determine the biggest part of our environmental agenda. The Company is committed to operating sustainably with continuous improvements in environmental performance.
The initial target for the DigiPlex group of entities in this area was to purchase all our electricity from certified, renewable sources. We first achieved this in July 2004. We have maintained this achievement ever since.
Our aim is to be the most environmentally friendly data centre provider in Europe and we have put this into action with our fiercely competitively low PUE achievements to date. We particularly welcome the opportunity to work with our customers and help them to achieve their own environmental performance improvement goals. With the above processes and initiative in place, the Board is very proud of the small environmental footprint that it leaves behind.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Company's policy is designed and implemented in a way to help tackle the challenges we face in today's society. The DigiPlex policy ensures that we responsibly and fairly recruit and manage DigiPlex employees on the basis of competence and performance regardless of age, nationality, race, gender, religious beliefs, sexuality, physical ability or cultural background. We strive on our ability to provide our customers an unprecedented level of support and flexibility in all aspects of providing a Data Centre service and do so in a manner that ensures our businesses future and the prosperity of all stakeholders involved.
The Company is committed to maintaining an open working environment in which employees and contractors are able to report instances of unethical, unlawful or undesirable conduct without fear of intimidation or reprisal. In order to maintain a current and effective responsibility strategy we promote transparency in the actions of all stakeholders and act on all relevant concerns highlighted for attention.
We take the responsibility of fairness and equality beyond our own walls and ensure that external parties with whom we engage in business are also focused on their responsibility to the wider community. The Company's tendering process clarifies whether the supplier has established its own policy and guidelines for corporate social responsibility, and whether it has been involved in incidents related to corruption, child labour or breaches of human rights or the rights of employees to unionise.
Information on such matters is obtained from the suppliers themselves or from other investigations. Possible conditions uncovered will be significant in qualifying the supplier for participation in the tendering process.
YEAR-END APPROPRIATIONS
The net loss for the year of NOK 1.6 million (2015: net loss of NOK 5.1 million) is transferred to retained earnings.

DigiPlex
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company is continually undertaking confidential research and development with the view of improving its processes, customer service, costs and its environmental footprint.
OUTLOOK
In 2017 the primary goal is to continue to renew existing customers and to provide tailor-made solutions including having the potential to expand its current available technical space, as required, to meet its customers' requirements in terms of providing highly reliable IT Housing. The Board is not aware of any additional risk factors facing the Company other than those outlined in this report.

To the General Meeting of Digiplex Norway AS
Independent Auditor's Report
Report on the Audit o f the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Digiplex Norway AS which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2016, income statement, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements are prepared in accordance with law and regulations and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2016, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by EU.
Basisfor Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilitiesfor the Audit o f the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company as required by laws and regulations, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. We have determined that there are no Key Audit Matters to communicate in our report.
Other information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Board of Directors' report, statements on Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with
PricewaterhouseCoopers AS, Postboks 748 Sentrum, NO-0106 Oslo T: 02316, org.no.: 987009 713 VAT, www.pwc.no State authorised public accountants, members o f The Norwegian Institute of Public Accountants, and authorised accounting firm

pwc

Independent Auditor's Report - Digiplex Norway AS

the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsiblities of The Board of Directors and the Managing Directorfor the Financial Statements
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director (management) are responsible for the preparation in accordance with law and regulations, including fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's Responsibilitiesfor the Audit o f the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

Independent Auditor's Report - Digiplex Norway AS

 conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit
We also provide the Board of Directors with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
Opinion on the Board o f Directors' report
Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Board of Directors' report and statements on Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption is consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations.

Opinion on Registration and Documentation
Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have considered necessary in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, it is our opinion that management has fulfilled its duty to produce a proper and clearly set out registration and documentation of the company's accounting information in accordance with the law and bookkeeping standards and practices generally accepted in Norway.

2.1.1 New and amended standards and interpretations
The Company has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time in their annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2016: - Accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations - Amendments to IFRS 11 - Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation - Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 - Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012 - 2014 cycle, and - Disclosure initiative - amendments to IAS 1.
The adoption of these amendments did not have any impact on the current period or any prior period and is not likely to affect future periods. The Company also elected to adopt the following amendments early: - Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to IAS 7. This amendment requires disclosure of changes in liabilities arising from financing activities.
The following new standards have been reviewed with regards to their effect on the Company's financial statements:
IFRS 9, `Financial instruments' IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities and introduces new rules for hedge accounting. In July 2014, the IASB made further changes to the classification and measurement rules and also introduced a new impairment model. These latest amendments now complete the new financial instruments standard. Following the changes approved by the IASB in July 2014, the Company no longer expects any impact from the new classification, measurement and derecognition rules on the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard is mandatory from 01.01.2018 and has not been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 15, `Revenue from contracts with customers' The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue. This will replace IAS 18 which covers contracts for goods and services and IAS 11 which covers construction contracts. The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer - so the notion of control replaces the existing notion of risks and rewards.The standard permits a modified retrospective approach for the adoption. Under this approach entities will recognise transitional adjustments in retained earnings on the date of initial application (e.g. 1 January 2017), i.e. without restating the comparative period. They will only need to apply the new rules to contracts that are not completed as of the date of initial application. The standard is mandatory from 01.01.2018 and has been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 16, 'Leases' IFRS 16 will affect primarily the accounting by lessees and will result in the recognition of almost all leases on balance sheet. The standard removes the current distinction between operating and financing leases and requires recognition of an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals for virtually all lease contracts. An optional exemption exists for short-term and low-value leases. The income statement will be affected, additionally, operating expense will be replaced with interest and depreciation, so EBITDA will change. The accounting by lessors will not significantly change. Some differences may arise as a result of the new guidance on the definition of a lease. Under IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
None of these new standards is expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements of the Company.

2.2 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes. The Company recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity; and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Company's activities, as described below. The Company bases its estimate of return on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.
Sales of services: The Company provides IT housing services including engineering support, connectivity and other IT services. For sales of services, revenue is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, by reference to stage of completion of the specific transaction and assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided. Where invoices are raised in advance for contracted services, the revenue is spread over the period of the service and deferred income is recognised in the balance sheet.
Sale of goods: The Company sells some IT related goods to its existing customers. Sales of goods are recognised when the entity has delivered and installed the products to the customer.

2.3 Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the board of directors that makes strategic decisions.

The Company has identified one segment; IT housing services, and one geographical segment; Oslo.

2.4 Classification of balance sheet items
Assets intended for long term ownership or use have been classified as fixed assets. Assets relating to the trading cycle have been classified as current assets. Other receivables are classified as current assets if they are to be repaid within one year after the transaction date. Similar criteria apply to liabilities. Instalments payable or receivable within one year on long term liabilities and long term receivables are classified as short term liabilities and current assets.
2.5 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
2.6 Cash and cash equivalents
In the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks.
2.7 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

2.8 Foreign currencies
Functional and presentation currency
The financial statements of the Company are presented in Norwegian kroner (NOK) which is the functional currency of the Company.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within `Other gains and losses'.

2.9 Employee benefits
The Company has one defined contribution plan. With a defined contribution plan the Company pays contributions to an insurance company. After the contribution has been made the Company has no further commitment to pay. The contribution is recognised as payroll expenses.

2.10 Taxation

Income tax expense represents the current tax calculated on taxable profits for the year, any adjustments in respect of prior periods and the deferred tax charge or credit for the year.

The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax base used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted and that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Deferred tax is reflected at nominal value.

2.11 Property, plant and equipment
Fixed assets are reflected in the balance sheet and depreciated to residual value over the asset's expected useful life on a straight-line basis. If changes in the depreciation plan occur the effect is distributed over the remaining depreciation period. Direct maintenance of an asset is expensed under operating expenses as and when it is incurred. Additions or improvements are added to the asset's cost price and depreciated together with the asset. The split between maintenance and additions/improvements is calculated in proportion to the asset's condition at the acquisition date.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts, net of their residual values, over their estimated useful lives or, in the case of leasehold improvements and certain leased plant and equipment, the shorter lease term as described in note 5.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement for the period.
2.12 Impairment of tangible assets
On an annual basis, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). The test is performed on the lowest level of fixed assets at which independent cash flows can be identified (Cash Generating Unit - CGU).
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
2.13 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Company will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.

2.14 Financial instruments

The Company has the following classes of financial assets and liabilities: Receivables and financial liabilities at amortised cost.
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date - the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Receivables

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers or services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non current assets. Receivables where collection is expected in one year or more are treated as non-current assets.

Receivables include cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables recognised in the balance sheet (notes 6 and 8). Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits.
The Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired. A financial asset is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a `loss event') and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or insolvency.
For loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor's credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.

2.15 Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.16 Government grant
Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Company will comply with all attached conditions.
Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the income statement over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are deducted from the cost of the asset and are credited to the income statement on a straight line basis over the expected lives of the related assets as part of depreciation.
2.17 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials. Costs are assigned to individual items of inventory on the basis of weighted average costs. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates and discounts. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. No impairments were made in 2016 nor in 2015.

3 Significant accounting estimates and assumptions
The application of accounting standards and policies requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that directly affect its reported financial condition and operating performance. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed are those that the Company considers to be most critical to its financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of estimates or assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgement involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance. Management have identified the following material estimates:

Deferred tax asset: The Company has a significant deferred tax asset. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and that taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference will be utilised. A change in this assumption will have significant effect on the financial statements.

Depreciation: Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. Changes in the estimated useful life will have significant effect on the financial statements.

4 Financial risk managem ent and Financial instruments
Financial risk management The Company's activities exposes it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Company's financial performance. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge any risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the Company's finance department under policies approved by the board of directors. The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
Market risk - foreign exchange risk The Company operates domestically and is therefore exposed to a limited foreign exchange risk.
Market risk - cash flow interest rate risk The Company's interest rate risk arises from a long-term bond loan (see note 12). Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk. The interest on the bond loan is adjusted quarterly.
Sensitivity analysis - cash flow interest rate risk At 31 December 2016, if the Norwegian key policy rate had been 10 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been approximately NOK 600,000 higher/lower, mainly as a result of higher/lower interest expense on bond borrowings.
Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. Management assesses the credit quality of the customers, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. Given the customers dependability of the services provided by the Company, there is a low collection risk, demonstrated through immaterial overdue accounts receivable at year end. Credit risk related to bank insolvency is closely monitored.

Liquidity risk The Company's finance department monitors rolling forecasts of the Company's liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs, while maintaining sufficient headroom at all times so that the Company does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.
The table on the next page analyses the Company's non-derivative financial liabilities and assets into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

The Company holds restricted cash to meet the cash outflow from certain transactions, see note 8 for details.

* Deposits from customers are payable on demand. There is no contractual obligation related to the customer contract.

Determination o f fair value The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts approximates fair value because these instruments have a short-term maturity date. Similarly, the carrying amount of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value as the impact of discounting is not significant.

Fair value of the bond loan is calculated to be NOK 578 million using the observations from the Norwegian Securities Dealers Association as 31.12.2016 (NOK 572 million at 31.12.2015). The bond was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 29 January 2016.

The fair value hierarchy The Company has not recognised any items at fair value as of 31 December 2016 or 31 December 2015. There has not been any transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during 2016 and 2015.

Classification of financial assets and liabilities The Company has the following classification of financial assets and liabilities.

Capital management The Company's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital management.

During 2015, according to the Company's strategy, the Company has refinanced, replacing the interest free shareholder loan and the interest bearing bank loan with an interest bearing bond loan. To ensure that the company complies with covenants, minimum liquidity and loan-to-value ratio is closely monitored.
