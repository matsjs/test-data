Rubicon Offshore Holdings Limited Group Management Financial Statements For the six months ended 30 June 2011
Background Rubicon is an offshore oilfield service company focused on the ownership and operation of two floating, production, storage and off-loading vessels ("FPSOs"). Management review Rubicon is pleased to present its latest management report. The Rubicon Intrepid is located at the Galoc Field, offshore the Philippines, where it is contracted to the Galoc Production Company ("GPC"). During the 2nd quarter, the vessel has remained connected throughout and achieved production uptime of 99.9% (and 98.9% for the 1st half of 2011).
Rubicon Vantage at the Bualuang Field, offshore Thailand
The Rubicon Vantage is located at the Bualuang Field, offshore Thailand, where it is contracted to Salamander Energy. The vessel continued to achieve good levels of production uptime during the 2nd quarter of 100% (and 99.6% for the 1st half of 2011). Early in 2011, the Board of Rubicon decided that the Company should focus solely on its FPSO business and therefore seek to sell the Rubicon Maverick multi-service vessel. An agreement to sell the vessel to S.B. Submarine Systems for US$35.5m was signed on 31 May 2011 and the sale completed on 18 July 2011.

Recent events
In early July 2011, Rubicon entered into an agreement with GPC under which Rubicon will undertake a significant upgrade of the mooring system for the Rubicon Intrepid through the installation of a turret mooring system on the FPSO. The project work is well underway and it is expected that in September 2011 the FPSO will leave the Galoc Field for the shipyard in Singapore for the mounting of the turret system on the vessel. The FPSO is planned to return to the Galoc Field, reconnect to the wells and resume production around the end of the year. The project will involve capital expenditure of approximately US$30-32m. This cost will be met from a combination of Rubicon's existing resources, supplemented by a capital injection from Rubicon's shareholders, capital contributions of approximately US$9m from GPC and a US$10,000/day increase in day rate for the remainder of the contract once the turret is installed successfully. The agreement with GPC also resolved satisfactorily the various disputes between the parties.
As referred to above, the sale of the Rubicon Maverick was completed on 18 July 2011 and the entire proceeds applied to repay the equivalent value of bonds at par. Under the terms of the US$ bonds, on a sale of the vessel, any excess proceeds over US$30m can be used by Rubicon to set against any of the scheduled future amortizations. Rubicon has elected to apply the excess proceeds of US$5.5m to reduce the 16 October 2011 amortization.
