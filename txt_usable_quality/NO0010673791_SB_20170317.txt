BACKGROUND

2.1 Company update and relevant documents

Due to the decline in the oil price, the Issuer's capital structure is not sustainable in the long term. In the current oil price environment, the Issuer's focus is on balance sheet strength, preservation of cash, and maintaining and increasing production from existing sites, albeit at capital expenditure levels reflecting the current environment.

On 29 December 2016 , the Issuer announced that it was in well progressed discussions with a strategic investor in respect of its capital restructuring options. On 1 March 2017, the Issuer announced that those discussions relate to a potential investment of USD 35 million of cash equity by Kerogen Capital II Limited ("Kerogen Capital"), and on 10 March 2017 the Issuer further announced an update to its restructuring discussions informing that indications o f support from approximately 662/3% o f the Secured Bonds and 40% of the Unsecured Bonds had been received during these discussions.

The Issuer has negotiated and agreed with Kerogen Capital the detailed terms on which an affiliate of Kerogen Capital (the "Kerogen Investor") has agreed to invest USD 35 million in cash in exchange for ordinaiy shares in the Issuer, as part of a full restructuring of the Issuer's capital structure and debt financing (the "Restructuring"). Kerogen Investor is an experienced global investment fund in the oil and gas sector, and the Issuer considers that the proposed investment and the Restructuring will preserve value from the Issuer's combined onshore conventional and shale business, including its carry agreements, for the benefit of all stakeholders. The Issuer believes that the Restructuring will result in a sustainable capital structure in the current oil price environment.

In addition to this summons, the Issuer has today published a shareholders circular, which gives an update on the Issuer's financial and operating status, as well as the proposed plan for the Restructuring (the "Shareholder Circular"). The Shareholder Circular is available at the Issuer's website www.igasplc.com.

The Restructuring involves, inter alia, contributions from Kerogen Investor as the new strategic investor, from the Bondholders in each of the Bond Issues and from existing shareholders. The proposed transactions in respect of the Bonds, and in respect of which the Bondholders will be asked to vote, are described in Annex 2 hereto (the "Bondholder Transactions").

Bondholders are encouraged to read all these documents to obtain an understanding of the proposed Restructuring. In particular, each Bondholder is encouraged to read the Shareholder Circular, including, without limitation, the disclosures made therein with respect to:

o Fundraising statistics (page 7); o Expected timetable and principal events (page 8); o The following sections of the letter from the chairman:
o Importance of resolutions being passed (page 23); o Current trading, trends and prospects (page 24); o Risk factors (page 43).

2.2

Background to and reasons for the Restructuring

The Company issued the Secured Bonds in March 2013 and the Unsecured Bonds in December 2013 when the price of oil was c.USD 110/bbl. Over the course of the last two years, the Company has been de-leveraging its balance sheet through a combination of farm outs and Bond buy backs as well as through the amortisation of the Secured Bonds. As at 31 January 2016, net debt was c. USD 120 million, comprising net Bonds outstanding of c. USD 153 million and cash of USD 31 million. Despite the oil price improving considerably from lows in the first quarter of 2016 and the de-leveraging of the Company's balance sheet, the board of directors of the Company considers that significant adjustments to the Company's capital structure remain necessary to achieve a capital structure that is sustainable in the current oil price environment, as well as enabling the Company to capitalise on value accretive opportunities in the future.

As has been previously announced, the Company forecasts a breach of its liquidity covenants under the Bond Agreements in late March 2017. If the proposed Fundraising (as defined below) and Bondholder Transactions are approved, the Restructuring would be implemented and the forecast liquidity covenant breaches would be remedied or waived in full by the Bondholders.

As has also been announced, the Company's current forecasts project non-compliance with its leverage covenants as at 31 December 2016, when its financial statements are delivered. If the Fundraising and Bondholder Transactions are approved, the forecast leverage covenants breaches would be irrevocably waived by the Bondholders.

The principal purposes of the proposed Fundraising and the Bondholder Transactions are to (i) remedy the Company's breach of its daily liquidity covenants forecast to arise at the end of March 2017 when the next amortisation and interest payment is due in respect of the Secured Bond; (ii) remedy the forecast leverage covenants breaches; and (iii) significantly de-leverage the Company by significantly reducing the net debt. The Proposal (as defined below) would remove the potential risk of enforcement by Bondholders as a result of such breaches and provide a stable platform by extending the maturity of the remaining Secured Bonds.

Completion of the proposed Fundraising and Bondholder Transactions would, if they are implemented in full, result in a reduction of net debt from c. USD 122 million to not more than USD 10 million following completion.

The proposed Fundraising (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Kerogen Subscription described below) and the Bondholder Transactions would be inter-conditional and in each case would be conditional on the approval by the requisite majority of shareholders, the holders of the Unsecured Bonds (the "Unsecured Bondholders"), the holders of the Secured Bonds (the "Secured Bondholders"), and the admission of the shares issued pursuant to the Fundraising and the Bondholder Transactions to trading on AIM pursuant to Rule 6 of the AIM Rules (as defined in Annex 2).

In structuring the Fundraising and the Bondholder Transactions, the Company has carefully considered the interests of all of its stakeholders, in light of their relative priorities in the capital structure, and the board of directors of the Company is of the view that the proposed Fundraising and Bondholder Transactions are in the best interest of the Company's stakeholders.

(iii) Conditional Secured Debt for Equity Swap: To the extent that the face value of the Secured Bonds accepted for sale in the Voluntary Equity Exchange referred to in (ii) above is less than USD 39,999,999, Secured Bonds with a face value equal to the shortfall shall be converted into New Ordinary Shares at the same price and on a pro rata basis among the Secured Bondholders.
(iv) Voluntary Cash Offer: The Issuer will invite the Secured Bondholders to offer for sale to the Issuer Secured Bonds in exchange of cash consideration of USD 1.00 for each Secured Bond, which corresponds to a price of 100% of the face value of the Secured Bonds.

Please find attached hereto a Bondholder's Form (Annex 1) from the Securities Depository (VPS), which indicates your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership o f the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' Meeting. If the Bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm: (i) the owner of the Bonds; (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds; and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered.
The individual Bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising the Bond Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' Meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership o f the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' Meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond Trustee, to notify the Bond Trustee by telephone or by e-mail (mail@nordictrustee.no) by 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Business Day before the Bondholders' Meeting takes place.

SUMMARY OF BONDHOLDER TRANSACTIONS 1. Details of the Bondholder Transactions

The Restructuring proposed by the Company includes the following transactions in respect of the Bonds, all of which are inter-conditional with the Fundraising (such that none of the below transactions occur unless all of the below are implemented (except that paragraph (b) and (d) may not be required depending on the level of tenders made in paragraphs (a) and (c) below) and the Fundraising Shares are issued and Admission occurs). Together the transactions set out at paragraphs (a) to (i) are the "Bondholder Transactions".

The Restructuring is conditional upon, inter alia, the general meeting of shareholders of the Company having approved the shareholder resolutions required in respect of the Restructuring, the Secured Bondholder Approved Transactions being approved by the Secured Bondholders, the Unsecured Bondholder Approved Transactions being approved by the Unsecured Bondholders (as described below), the Fundraising Shares being issued and Admission occurring. If these conditions are satisfied, the Bondholder Transactions shall take place in the order set out below on the Completion Date (subject to the waivers being made on the terms set out below).

Waivers

The waivers set out in (f) and (h) below, if approved by both the requisite majority of Secured Bondholders and Unsecured Bondholders, shall take effect (on the terms set out in the Bondholder Summons which shall prevail for the purposes of the waivers) on 3 April 2017, provided that the waivers shall expire (and the Bondholders' rights shall be re-instated in full) if the general meeting of shareholders of the Company has voted not to approve the shareholder resolutions required in respect of the Fundraising or if the Restructuring has not completed on or before the Longstop Date.

Secured Bonds

In order for the Restructuring to be implemented, the requisite majority of Secured Bondholders (as further described below) shall be required to approve the transactions set out at (b), (d), (e), and (f) (the "Secured Bondholder Approved Transactions") and individual Secured Bondholders may, at their discretion, take part in the transactions set out at (a) and (c) below.

a) Voluntary Equity Exchange: the Company shall accept voluntary offers made by Secured Bondholders to sell part or all of their Secured Bonds to the Company and cancel them on the terms below (the "Offered Bonds"):

(i)

at a fixed all-in price of 100% of face value for every $1 of face value of the Secured

Bonds based on the Exchange Rate, with no additional consideration being paid in

respect of accrued interest relating to the period from and including 22 March 2017;

(ii)

in consideration for the issue by the Company of New Ordinary Shares at the Issue

Price, for up to US$60 million of face value of the Secured Bonds (the "Maximum

Equity Conversion Amount");

(iii)

only valid offers for the exchange of sufficient Offered Bonds to ensure that the

aggregate value of the New Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued to the relevant

Offering Secured Bondholders (as defined below) at the Issue Price will be equal to or

greater than US$110,000 (calculated to be in excess of 100,000 on the basis of an

agreed exchange rate of 1 EUR:1.0613 USD) (the "Minimum Tendering Amount")

shall be accepted by the Company;

(iv) to the extent that the aggregate face value of all the Offered Bonds of any or all of the Secured Bondholders (the "Offering Secured Bondholders") is equal to or below US$50 million less an amount equal to 50% of the proceeds of the Placing and Ancillary Subscription (the "Secured Bond Conversion Minimum"), the Company shall accept such offers in full (on the terms described above);

LON44707257/12 168001-0001

Annex 2

(v)

to the extent that the aggregate face value of all the Offered Bonds of any or all of the

Offering Secured Bondholders exceeds the Secured Bond Conversion Minimum, the

Company shall not be obliged to but may elect to accept, in part or in full, such offers

(on the terms described above) up to the Maximum Equity Conversion Amount. If the

Company accepts such offers in part, it will first accept Offered Bonds with a face

value equal to the Minimum Tendering Amount from each Offering Secured

Bondholder, and thereafter it shall accept Offered Bonds on a pro rata basis from

each Offering Secured Bondholder, in the proportion borne by the balance of its

Offered Bonds to the balance of the aggregate Offered Bonds of all Offering Secured

Bondholders (in each case after deduction of the Minimum Tendering Amount).

Notwithstanding the above, in the highly unlikely event that the Maximum Equity

Conversion Amount is not sufficient to accept Offered Bonds with a face value equal

to the Minimum Tendering Amount from all Offering Secured Bondholders, the

Company will select those Offering Secured Bondholders from whom it will accept

Offered Bonds with a face value equal to the Minimum Tendering Amount by drawing

lots and only those selected by drawing lots and who have tendered the Minimum

Tendering Amount shall be selected; and

(vi) all Secured Bonds purchased by the Company in this Voluntary Equity Exchange shall be released and cancelled in full (the "Cancelled Offered Bonds").

b) Conditional Secured Debt for Equity Swap: if the aggregate face value of the Cancelled Offered Bonds is less than the Secured Bond Conversion Minimum, the Company shall:

(i)

purchase and cancel in full Secured Bonds with a total aggregate face value (and

waive all interest accrued thereon relating to the period from and including 22 March

2017 on such Secured Bonds) in an amount equal to the shortfall, being the difference

between the face value of the Cancelled Offered Bonds and the Secured Bond

Conversion Minimum,

(ii)

in consideration for the issue by the Company of New Ordinary Shares at the Issue

Price to the Secured Bondholders at a fixed all-in price of 100% of face value for

every $1 of face value of Secured Bonds purchased and cancelled, based on the

Exchange Rate,

on a pro rata basis, in respect of each such Secured Bondholder (excluding the Company as Secured Bondholder), in the proportion borne by its Secured Bonds (excluding the Cancelled Offered Bonds and the Company Bonds) to all Secured Bonds (excluding the Cancelled Offered Bonds and the Company Bonds). There shall be no Minimum Tendering Amount in respect of the Conditional Secured Debt for Equity Swap.

c) Voluntary Cash Offers: the Company shall accept voluntary offers made by Secured Bondholders to sell part or all of their Secured Bonds to the Company and cancel them on the terms below (the "Cash Offered Bonds"):

(i)

at a fixed all-in price of 100% of face value for every $1 of face value of the Secured

Bonds, with no additional consideration being paid in respect of accrued interest

relating to the period from and including 22 March 2017 on such Secured Bonds;

(ii)

in consideration for cash;

(iii)

to the extent that the aggregate face value of all the Cash Offered Bonds offered for

purchase and cancellation by any or all of the Secured Bondholders (the "Cash

Offering Secured Bondholders" ) is equal to or below the Secured Bond Cash

Cancellation Minimum the Company shall accept the Cash Offered Bonds in full (on

the terms described above);

(iv)

to the extent that the aggregate face value of the Cash Offered Bonds offered for sale

by any or all of the Cash Offering Secured Bondholders exceeds the Secured Bond

Cash Cancellation Minimum, and would, if accepted, not require more than the

LON44707257/12 168001-0001

Annex 2

Excess Cash Amount (as defined below) to be paid to such Offering Secured Bondholders, the Company shall accept the Cash Offered Bonds in excess of the Secured Bond Cash Cancellation Minimum in full (on the terms described above);

(v)

to the extent that the aggregate face value of the Cash Offered Bonds exceeds the

Secured Bond Cash Cancellation Minimum and would, if accepted, require more than

the Excess Cash Amount to be paid to such Cash Offering Secured Bondholders, the

Company shall accept such Cash Offered Bonds in full (or in part) on the terms

described above up to the Excess Cash Amount and shall elect, in its absolute

discretion, whether to accept, in full or in part, such offers in excess of the Excess

Cash Amount on the terms described above. To the extent that the Company accepts

any offers in part, it shall do so on a pro rata basis, in respect of each Cash Offering

Secured Bondholder, in the proportion borne by its Cash Offered Bonds to the

aggregate of all Cash Offered Bonds; and

(vi)

all Secured Bonds purchased by the Company shall be released and cancelled in full

(the "Cash Cancelled Offered Bonds").

For the purposes of the Voluntary Cash Offer described above, the Secured Bond Cash Cancellation Minimum shall mean:

(A)

US$30 million (face value); or

(B)

if the amount of the Secured Bonds tendered and accepted through the Voluntary

Equity Exchange exceeds the Secured Bond Conversion Minimum, $30 million less

50% of such excess.

Excess Cash Amount means the total net proceeds of the Placing and the Ancillary Subscription.

d) Conditional Cash Cancellation: if the aggregate face value of the Cash Cancelled Offered Bonds is less than the Secured Bond Cash Cancellation Minimum, the Company shall:

(i)

purchase and cancel in full an amount of Secured Bonds (and waive all accrued

interest thereon relating to the period from and including 22 March 2017) with a total

aggregate face value equal to the shortfall, being the difference between the face

value of the Cash Cancelled Offered Bonds and the Secured Bond Cash Cancellation

Minimum,

(ii)

in consideration for the payment (in cash) by the Company to the Secured

Bondholders at a fixed all-in price of 100% of par value of the Secured Bonds

purchased and cancelled,

on a pro rata basis, in respect of each such Secured Bondholder (excluding the Company as Secured Bondholder), in the proportion borne by its Secured Bonds (excluding the Cancelled Offered Bonds and the Cash Cancelled Offered Bonds) to all Secured Bonds (excluding the Cancelled Offered Bonds and Cash Cancelled Offered Bonds and the Company Bonds).

e) Amendments to the terms of the remaining Secured Bonds: a resolution of at least 66%% of the Voting Bonds of the Secured Bonds (represented at the Bondholder Meeting) shall authorise the Bond Trustee to amend the balance of the Secured Bonds remaining following the transactions listed above and a summary of the amendments are set out below (together, the "Bond Agreement Amendments") (all terms below shall have the meaning given to them in the Amended Secured Bond Agreement):
