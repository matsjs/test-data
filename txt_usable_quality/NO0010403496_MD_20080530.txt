Re: In re Viking Offshore (USA) Inc., et al., Case Nos. 08-31219, 31222, 31224, 31226 and 31228; in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division
Our firm, Thompson & Knight LLP, was retained by Norsk Tillitsmann to represent it as Loan Trustee in the bankruptcy cases of Viking Offshore (USA), Viking Prospector Inc., Viking Producer Inc., Viking Century Inc., and Viking Drilling ASA.
As you are aware, Viking Offshore (USA), Viking Prospector Inc., Viking Producer Inc., Viking Century Inc., and Viking Drilling ASA filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Houston, Texas on February 29, 2008. Chapter 11 is a reorganization process that is designed to allow the company and its creditors to restructure the balance sheet of an insolvent entity. Typically, the debtors stay in control of the management and operations of their business and must seek approval from the Bankruptcy Court before doing any business outside the ordinary course. The debtor has an initial exclusive period of time to propose a plan of reorganization of 120 days (plus extensions granted at the court's discretion), after which the creditors are entitled to file their own restructuring plan. The current exclusivity period expires June 28, 2008. On May 22, 2008, Viking filed a motion requesting this exclusive period be extended to December 31, 2008. No hearing has been scheduled on that motion at this writing.
Once a plan is proposed, creditors then vote to either approve or reject the proposed chapter 11 plan. If a plan is approved by the creditors, it will bind all creditors and parties-in-interest, regardless of whether they voted for or against the plan. Sometimes a chapter 11 plan contemplates the complete liquidation of the debtors through an orderly process managed by the debtors but subject to bankruptcy court approval. These debtors have clearly stated their intent to liquidate through the chapter 11 process.
These cases were precipitated by a maritime seizure of the vessel Viking Producer instituted by the Gulf Copper yard based on nonpayment. The debtors filed chapter 11 in order to obtain the release of the Viking Producer. Shortly after filing, the debtors reached an agreement with the storage yard for storage of the Viking Producer rig, including its release from the maritime seizure. These bankruptcy cases are all being administered as one main case for administrative ease. The debtors have established a cash management procedure pursuant to bankruptcy regulations. The debtors have employed a Chief Financial Officer in Norway, a lawyer in Norway, and general bankruptcy counsel in Houston. In addition, the debtors have retained R.S. Platou USA Inc. as broker to market and sell the rigs. Platou has an exclusive listing for two

months, beginning April 22,2008, after which the debtors are free to contract with other brokers, though Platou retains a right to a commission under certain conditions that are typical in the industry.
At least two creditors have filed notices that they have perfected maritime liens against the debtors' assets. We believe that number will increase substantially. Under U.S. maritime law, we believe it is likely that a vendor who provides necessaries to the debtors will be granted a maritime lien that has priority over a ship's mortgage lien. Because of this provision, it appears that the vast majority of the debtors' trade vendors are or will be secured creditors.
From the evidence provided by the debtors to us, it appears that there currently are few employees at Viking Offshore: 3 full time (Heagney, Driver and Ettinger), 1 part-time, 1 temporary and 4 contract employees. The parent Viking Drilling ASA has only 1 employee, being Mr. Niels Feilberg in Oslo. There are no other employees at this time.
Several days before filing, Norsk Tillitsmann foreclosed on funds held in Swedbank, being the remaining proceeds of the second lien bonds. Debtors have advised us that they have questions about the validity and propriety of this action, though no litigation has been undertaken.
Viking Drilling ASA advises that it currently has about $400,000 USD in an account in Oslo that it is using to pay its obligations in Norway. The rest of the debtors' cash has been moved to the US.
Through Platou, it is the companies' intent to sell the Producer rig to a purchaser that, the debtors hope, will assume the existing refurbishment contracts that are in place. The debtors' attorneys have explained that Viking Offshore (USA) has entered into contracts with vendors, suppliers, and engineers to provide $52 mm USD worth of future work. These are services and materials that have not been performed or delivered and the company is trying to avoid breaching those contracts that the debtors' fear will create additional claims in the bankruptcy. If the company sells the Producer without those contracts being assumed, the company will have to reject them, which is the equivalent of a prepetition breach of contract. The rejection may then create "rejection damages," which could be unsecured claims against the debtors in the bankruptcy cases.
Platou was retained by order of the court on April 22, 2008, and has been engaged in distributing information to prospective purchasers and scheduling inspections of the rigs since that date. Platou advises that interest by potential purchasers is typical for this type of engagement and that the marketing process may last through the summer, though offers may start being submitted at any time.
We are advised that debtors currently have about $16 mm USD in available and unencumbered cash. Debtors believe this amount is sufficient to liquidate and get through the chapter 11 sale process. Thus, the debtors advise that they have no need to borrow further.
The debtors' attorneys tell us that there exist a total of $18 mm USD of maritime liens, basically comprised of vendor debt in connection with the refurbishment of the Producer rig. The debtors

Bondholders May 29, 2008 Page 3
believe there is no unsecured debt, since they believe that all vendors will have maritime liens against the Producer rig. This $18 mm USD is in addition to the $52 mm USD of future work on existing contracts.
Debtors also believe that all $18 mm USD of maritime liens will prime (that is, come ahead of) the first preferred ship's mortgage of Norsk Tillitsmann with respect to the vessel Viking Producer. It does not appear that those maritime liens, assuming they are valid, would prime the mortgages on the other two rigs since none of the services and materials were provided to those rigs.
Going forward, we will continue to monitor the cases. When and if sales are proposed, we will be advised and report back to Norsk Tillitsmann.
