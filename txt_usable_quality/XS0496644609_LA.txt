(ii) the Issuer fails to perform or observe in any respect any of its other obligations in respect of the Notes which default is incapable of remedy or is not remedied within the period of 30 days after notice thereof has been given to the Issuer or the Fiscal Agent requiring the same to be remedied; or
(iii) any Financial Indebtedness (as defined below) of the Issuer or any Material Subsidiary shall be or be declared due and payable prior to the date on which the same would otherwise become due and payable by reason of the occurrence of an event of default (howsoever described) in relation thereto or the Issuer or any Material Subsidiary defaults in the repayment of any Financial Indebtedness on the due date for payment thereof or at the expiry of any applicable grace period or any guarantee or indemnity in respect of any such Financial Indebtedness given by the Issuer or any Material Subsidiary shall not be paid when due and called upon or at the expiry of any applicable grace period, save in any such case where there is a bona fide dispute as to whether payment or repayment is due, provided that no Event of Default will occur if the aggregate amount of Financial Indebtedness referred to above is less than an amount equal to three (3) per cent. of the Issuer's total equity as specified in the Issuer's then latest published financial statements; or
(iv) any order shall be made by any competent court or resolution passed for the winding up or dissolution of the Issuer or any Material Subsidiary or an administration order is made in relation to the Issuer or any Material Subsidiary (other than for the purpose of (a) an amalgamation, merger or reconstruction approved by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders or (b) a voluntary solvent winding up of any Material Subsidiary); or
(v) the Issuer or any Material Subsidiary shall cease to carry on the whole or substantially the whole of its business (other than a cessation in the circumstances referred to in the exception to paragraph (iv) of this Condition 8 or in connection with the transfer of all or a major part of the business, undertaking and assets of any Material Subsidiary to the Issuer or another of its Subsidiaries); or
(vi) the Issuer or any Material Subsidiary shall stop payment or shall be unable to, or shall admit inability to, pay its debts as they fall due, or shall be adjudicated or found bankrupt or insolvent by a court of competent jurisdiction or shall make a conveyance or assignment for the benefit of, or shall enter into any composition or other arrangement with, its creditors generally; or
(vii) a receiver, trustee, administrator or liquidator or other similar official shall be appointed in relation to the Issuer or any Material Subsidiary or in relation to the whole or a substantial part of the undertaking, revenue or assets of any of them or an encumbrancer shall take possession of the whole or a substantial part of the undertaking, revenue or assets of the Issuer or any Material Subsidiary, or a distress or execution or other process shall be levied or enforced upon or sued out against the whole or a substantial part of the undertaking, revenue or assets of any of them and in any of the foregoing cases it or he shall not be discharged within 45 days; or
(viii) any event occurs which under the laws of Denmark has an analogous effect to any of the events referred to in paragraphs (vi) or (vii) above,
then any Note may, by notice in writing given to the Fiscal Agent at its specified office by the holder, be declared immediately due and payable whereupon it shall become immediately due and payable at its principal amount together with accrued interest without further formality.
Notice of any Event of Default will promptly be given to the Noteholders by the Issuer.
For the purposes of these Conditions:
33

Financial Indebtedness means any indebtedness for or in respect of moneys borrowed; and
a Material Subsidiary means, at any time, any Subsidiary of the Issuer whose gross assets or pre tax profits (excluding intra-Group items) then equal or exceed 15 per cent. of the gross assets or pre tax profits of the Group, but excluding any Subsidiary (an Excluded Subsidiary) that is a single purpose company whose principal assets are constituted by one or more projects or contracts, none of whose Financial Indebtedness is the subject of security, a guarantee or indemnity from the Issuer or any Material Subsidiary, and which the Issuer has designated as such for the time-being by written notice to the Agent.
For this purpose:
(a) the gross assets or pre-tax profits of a Subsidiary of the Issuer (excluding intra-Group items) will be determined from its financial statements (unconsolidated if it has Subsidiaries) upon which the latest audited financial statements of the Group have been based;
(b) if a Subsidiary of the Issuer becomes a member of the Group after the date on which the latest audited financial statements of the Group have been prepared, the gross assets or pre tax profits (excluding intra-Group items) of that Subsidiary will be determined from its latest financial statements;
(c) the gross assets or pre-tax profits (excluding intra-Group items) of the Group will be determined from its latest audited financial statements, adjusted (where appropriate) to reflect the gross assets or pre-tax profits (excluding intra-Group items) of any company or business subsequently acquired or disposed of; and
(d) if a Material Subsidiary disposes of all or substantially all of its assets to another Subsidiary of the Issuer, it will immediately cease to be a Material Subsidiary and the other Subsidiary (if it is not already) will immediately become a Material Subsidiary; the subsequent financial statements of those Subsidiaries and the Group will be used to determine whether those Subsidiaries are Material Subsidiaries or not.
If there is a dispute as to whether or not a member of the Group is a Material Subsidiary, a certificate of the auditors of the Issuer will be, in the absence of manifest error, conclusive.
9. Prescription
Claims in respect of principal and interest will become void unless presentation for payment is made as required by Condition 6 within a period of 10 years in the case of principal and five years in the case of interest from the appropriate Relevant Date.
10. Replacement of Notes and Coupons
If any Note or Coupon is lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed it may be replaced at the specified office of the Paying Agent in Luxembourg subject to all applicable laws and stock exchange or other relevant authority requirements, upon payment by the claimant of the expenses incurred in connection with such replacement and on such terms as to evidence, security, indemnity and otherwise as the Issuer may require (provided that the requirement is reasonable in the light of prevailing market practice). Mutilated or defaced Notes or Coupons must be surrendered before replacements will be issued.
34

11. Meetings of Noteholders and Modification/Modification and Substitution
(a) Meetings ofNoteholders
The Fiscal Agency Agreement contains provisions for convening meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests, including the sanctioning by Extraordinary Resolution of a modification of any of these Conditions. Such a meeting may be convened by Noteholders holding not less than 10 per cent. in principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding. The quorum for any meeting convened to consider an Extraordinary Resolution will be one or more persons holding or representing a clear majority in principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding, or at any adjourned meeting one or more persons being or representing Noteholders whatever the principal amount of the Notes held or represented, unless the business of such meeting includes consideration of proposals, inter alia, (i) to modify the maturity of the Notes or the dates on which interest is payable in respect of the Notes, (ii) to reduce or cancel the principal amount of, or interest on, the Notes, (iii) to change the currency of payment of the Notes or the Coupons, or (iv) to modify the provisions concerning the quorum required at any meeting of Noteholders or the majority required to pass an Extraordinary Resolution, in which case the necessary quorum will be one or more persons holding or representing not less than two-thirds, or at any adjourned meeting not less than one-third, in principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding. Any Extraordinary Resolution duly passed shall be binding on Noteholders (whether or not they were present at the meeting at which such resolution was passed) and on all Couponholders.
In addition, a resolution in writing signed by or on behalf of 90 per cent. of the Noteholders who for the time being are entitled to receive notice of a meeting of Noteholders will take effect as if it were an Extraordinary Resolution. Such a resolution in writing may be contained in one document or several documents in the same form, each signed by or on behalf of one or more Noteholders.

References in Condition 8 to obligations under the Notes shall be deemed to include obligations under the Deed Poll, and the events listed in Condition 8 shall be deemed to include that guarantee not being (or being claimed by the guarantor not to be) in full force and effect.
(d) Requirements of Luxembourg Stock Exchange
In the case of substitution pursuant to this Condition, the Substitute shall comply (for so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange) with the then prevailing requirements of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange in connection with any such substitution.
12. Further Issues
The Issuer may from time to time without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders create and issue further securities either having the same terms and conditions as the Notes in all respects (or in all respects except for the first payment of interest on them) and so that such further issue shall be consolidated and form a single series with the outstanding securities of any series (including the Notes) or upon such terms as the Issuer may determine at the time of their issue. References in these Conditions to the Notes include (unless the context requires otherwise) any other securities issued pursuant to this Condition and forming a single series with the Notes.
13. Notices
Notices to Noteholders will be valid if published in a leading newspaper having general circulation in London (which is expected to be the Financial Times) and (so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of that Stock Exchange so require) published either on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) or in a leading newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, if such publication shall not be practicable, in an English language newspaper of general circulation in Europe. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than once or on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made. Couponholders will be deemed for all purposes to have notice of the contents of any notice given to the Noteholders in accordance with this Condition.

14. Currency Indemnity
If any sum due from the Issuer in respect of the Notes or the Coupons or any order or judgment given or made in relation thereto has to be converted from the currency (the "first currency") in which the same is payable under these Conditions or such order or judgment into another currency (the "second currency") for the purpose of (a) making or filing a claim or proof against the Issuer, (b) obtaining an order or judgment in any court or other tribunal or (c) enforcing any order or judgment given or made in relation to the Notes, the Issuer shall indemnify each Noteholder, on the written demand of such Noteholder addressed to the Issuer and delivered to the Issuer or to the specified office of the Fiscal Agent, against any loss suffered as a result of any discrepancy between (i) the rate of exchange used for such purpose to convert the sum in question from the first currency into the second currency and (ii) the rate or rates of exchange at which such Noteholder may in the ordinary course of business purchase the first currency with the second currency upon receipt of a sum paid to it in satisfaction, in whole or in part, of any such order, judgment, claim or proof.
This indemnity constitutes a separate and independent obligation of the Issuer and shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action.
15. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999
No person shall have any right to enforce any term or condition of the Notes under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
16. Governing Law

SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE NOTES WHILE IN GLOBAL FORM
The Notes will initially be in the form of the Temporary Global Note which will be deposited on or around the Closing Date with a common safekeeper for the ICSDs. The Notes will be issued in NGN form and are intended to be held in a manner which will allow Eurosystem eligibility. This does not necessarily mean that the Notes will be recognised as eligible collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy and intra-day credit operations by the Eurosystem either upon issue or at any or all times during their life. Such recognition will depend upon satisfaction of the Eurosystem eligibility criteria.
So long as the Notes are represented by a Temporary Global Note or a Permanent Global Note and the relevant clearing system(s) so permit, the Notes will be tradeable only in a minimum authorised denomination of 50,000 and higher integral multiples of 1,000, notwithstanding that no Definitive Notes will be issued with a denomination above 99,000.
The Temporary Global Note and the Permanent Global Note contain provisions which apply to the Notes while they are in global form, some of which modify the effect of the terms and conditions of the Notes set out in this document. The following is a summary of certain of those provisions:
1. Nominal Amount and Exchange
The nominal amount of the Notes represented by the Global Notes shall be the aggregate amount from time to time entered in the records of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or, in the case of the Permanent Global Note, any permitted alternative clearing system (each a relevant Clearing System). The records of the relevant Clearing Systems (which expression means the records that each relevant Clearing System holds for its accountholders which reflect the amount of such accountholders' interests in the Notes) shall be conclusive evidence of the nominal amount of Notes represented by the Global Notes and a statement issued by a relevant Clearing System stating the nominal amount of Notes represented by the Global Notes at any time shall be conclusive evidence of the records of that relevant Clearing System at that time.
The Temporary Global Note is exchangeable in whole or in part for interests recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing System in the Permanent Global Note on or after a date which is expected to be 3 May 2010 upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership in the form set out in the Temporary Global Note. No payments will be made under the Temporary Global Note unless exchange for interests in the Permanent Global Note is improperly withheld or refused. In addition, interest payments in respect of the Notes cannot be collected without such certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership.
The Permanent Global Note is exchangeable in whole but not, except as provided in the next paragraph, in part (free of charge to the holder) for the Definitive Notes described below (i) if the Permanent Global Note is held on behalf of a relevant Clearing System and any such relevant Clearing System is closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holidays, statutory or otherwise) or announces an intention permanently to cease business or does in fact do so, (ii) if principal in respect of any Notes is not paid when due and payable under Condition 8; or (iii) the Issuer has or will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would not be suffered were the Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note in definitive form. Thereupon (in the case of (i) or (ii) above) the holder may give notice to the Fiscal Agent, and (in the case of (iii) above) the Issuer may give notice to the Fiscal Agent and the Noteholders, of its intention to exchange the Permanent Global Note for Definitive Notes on or after the Exchange Date specified in the notice.
If the principal in respect of any Note is not paid when due and payable under Condition 8 the holder of the Permanent Global Note may by notice to the Fiscal Agent (which may but need not be the default notice referred to in "Default" below) require the exchange of a specified principal amount of the Permanent Global Note (which may be equal to or (provided that, if the Permanent Global Note
38

is held by or on behalf of a relevant Clearing System, that relevant Clearing System agrees) less than the outstanding principal amount of Notes represented thereby) for Definitive Notes on or after the Exchange Date (as defined below) specified in such notice.
On or after any Exchange Date (as defined below) the holder of the Permanent Global Note may, or in the case of paragraph (iii) above shall, surrender the Permanent Global Note or present it for endorsement to or to the order of the Fiscal Agent. In exchange for the Permanent Global Note or, the part thereof to be exchanged, the Issuer will deliver, or procure the delivery of (free of charge to the bearer), an equal aggregate principal amount of duly executed and authenticated Definitive Notes (having attached to them all Coupons in respect of interest which has not already been paid on the Permanent Global Note), security printed in accordance with any applicable legal and stock exchange requirements and in or substantially in the form set out in Schedule 1 to the Fiscal Agency Agreement. On exchange in full of the Permanent Global Note, the Issuer will if the holder so requests, procure that it is cancelled and returned to the holder together with any relevant Definitive Notes.
Exchange Date means a day specified in the notice requiring exchange falling not less than 60 days, or in the case of exchange pursuant to (ii) above 30 days, after that on which the notice requiring exchange is given and being a day on which banks are open for general business in the place in which the specified office of the Fiscal Agent is located and, except in the case of exchange pursuant to (i) above, in the place in which the relevant Clearing System is located.
2. Payments
No payment will be made on the Temporary Global Note unless exchange for an interest in the Permanent Global Note is improperly withheld or refused. Payments of principal and interest in respect of Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note will be made to its holder. The Issuer shall procure that details of each such payment shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing System and, in the case of payments of principal, the nominal amount of the Notes will be reduced accordingly. Each payment so made will discharge the Issuer's obligations in respect thereof. Any failure to make the entries in the records of the relevant Clearing System shall not affect such discharge.
3. Notices
So long as the Notes are represented by a Global Note and such Global Note is held on behalf of a relevant Clearing System, notices to Noteholders may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to that relevant Clearing System for communication by it to entitled accountholders in substitution for publication as required by the Conditions except that, so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of that Exchange so require, notices shall also be published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).
4. Prescription
Claims against the Issuer in respect of principal and interest on the Notes while the Notes are represented by the Permanent Global Note will become void unless it is presented for payment within a period of 10 years (in the case of principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the appropriate Relevant Date (as defined in Condition 7).
5. Meetings
The holder of the Permanent Global Note will be treated as being two persons for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, a meeting of Noteholders and, at any such meeting, as having one vote in respect of each 1,000 in principal amount of Notes for which the Permanent Global Note may be exchanged.
39

6. Cancellation On cancellation of any Note required by the Conditions to be cancelled following its redemption, or if the Issuer requires any Notes represented by a Global Note to be cancelled following purchase, the Issuer shall procure that details of such cancellation shall be entered pro rata in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and, upon any such entry being made, the nominal amount of the Notes recorded in the records of the relevant Clearing Systems and represented by this Global Note shall be reduced by the aggregate nominal amount of the Notes so cancelled.
7. Default The Permanent Global Note provides that the holder may cause the Permanent Global Note to become due and payable in the circumstances described in Condition 8 by stating in the notice to the Fiscal Agent the principal amount of Notes which is being declared due and payable. If principal in respect of any Note is not paid when due and payable, the holder of the Permanent Global Note may elect that the Permanent Global Note becomes void as to a specified portion and that the persons entitled to such portion as accountholders with a relevant Clearing System acquire direct enforcement rights against the Issuer under further provisions of the Permanent Global Note executed by the Issuer as a deed poll.
40

USE OF PROCEEDS The net proceeds of the issue of the Notes, amounting to approximately 595,660,500, will be applied by the Issuer for general financing and corporate purposes.
