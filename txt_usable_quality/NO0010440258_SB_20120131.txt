and

4. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL
The Borrowers' evaluation
In view of the recent months' fall of short- and long term interest levels, the Borrower considers the interests rate of the bond issue to be at an attractive level and therefore does not suggest any changes to the interest rate. The loan agreement was signed 13 June 2008 when 3 month NIBOR was 6.23%. On 23 January 2012 3 month NIBOR was 2.67%.
The Borrower also considers that through the Tender offer of NOK 100 million in June 2011 and the proposed redemption of NOK 55 million the Borrower has added liquidity to the market for any bondholders seeking en exit.
The Borrower is of the opinion that an early clarification of the long term financing of the Borrower is in the interest of all stakeholders.
The shareholders have already made significant contribution to the capitalisation of the Borrower.
In addition to the proposal above the Borrower has considered to propose to extend the maturity with 3 years, but to keep the loan at NOK 344,500,000 and to partially or wholly sell the Borrower's Bonds in the market.
Non-reliance of the Loan Trustee:
The Proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their legal and financial advisers regarding the effect of the Proposal.
