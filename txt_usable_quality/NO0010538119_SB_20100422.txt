the bondholders' advisors and NTM. However, pursuing these alternatives will take more time and the company is yet not ready to present a definite plan. For further details on the situation reference is made to the first Summons and Company's Q1 presentation.
In the further process it is deemed sensible to reduce the number of days required from a summons to a bondholders' meeting is dispatched until the meeting may be held. Hence, an amendment of Clause 16.2.4 is also included in the below proposal.

EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL

3.1 The Company's evaluation

The Company is of the view that a temporary waiver will facilitate the process for concluding the financial plan, while reducing the risk of unnecessary uncertainty. The Company has not been able to identify any adverse implications of the Proposal for the Bondholders. In the Company's opinion, the Proposal should hence be fully aligned with the interests of the Bondholders. The Proposal will allow the Company the opportunity to focus on creating the necessary basis for discussions of a robust financial solution, which is vital to the safeguarding of the interests of all of its stakeholders, including the Bondholders.

3.2 NTM's evaluation
NTM recommend that the proposal is accepted as it seems unsuitable to stop the process at this point. The Company is offering what is deemed to be a fair compensation for the waiver to be given. However, The Bondholders must independently evaluate, based on available information, whether the Proposal is acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from tax and other advisors regarding the effects and possible consequences of the Proposal.

Please find attached as Exhibit 1 a bondholder's form (the "Bondholder's Form") from the Securities Depository ("VPS"), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' meeting. If the Bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered as owner in VPS - the custodian must confirm (i) the ownership of the Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered.
Each Bondholder may authorize NTM to vote on its behalf, in which case the completed Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorizing NTM to vote, must for this purpose be returned to NTM in due time before

In the event any Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was issued, the new owner must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy (as the case may be) evidence which, in the reasonable opinion of NTM, is sufficient to establish the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy (other than to NTM), to notify NTM by telephone or by email (at set out in the first page of this letter) by 16:00 hours (4.00 p.m.) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
