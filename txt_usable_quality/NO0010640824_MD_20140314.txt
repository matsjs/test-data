OSX 3 Leasing B.V. to launch Restructuring Proposal to Bondholders
Rio de Janeiro, March 13, 2014 - OSX Brasil S.A. - In Judicial Reorganization ("OSX" or "Com pany") (BM&FBovespa: OSXB3), a Brazilian publicly held corporation which provides eq uipm ent and services to the offshore oil and natural gas industry, with integrated operations in shipbuilding, leasing of exploration and production (E&P) units and operation and m aintenance services (O&M) announces that its subsidiary OSX 3 Leasing B.V. ("OSX 3" and tog ether with certain o f its affiliates, the "OSX 3 Group"), is pleased to announce that follow ing m onths o f restructuring discussions w ith its creditors it has reached agreem ent on the key term s of a restructuring (the "Proposed Restructuring") of the Bonds and certain other finance and project documents. OSX 3 intends to convene a meeting of the holders of the 9.25% OSX 3 Leasing B.V. Senior Secured C allable Bond Issue 2012/2015 (the "Bonds" and holders thereof, the "Bondholders") in the near future w ith the aim of securing form al Bondholder approval of the term s of the Proposed Restructuring before moving to docum ent the term s of the Proposed Restructuring.
By w ay of background, as a result o f the filing fo r judicial reorganisation in Brazil on 30 O ctober 2013 by OGX Petroleo e Gas S.A. - In Judicial Reorganization and Oleo e Gas Participagoes S.A. - In Judicial Reorganization (form erly OGX Petroleo e Gas Participagoes S.A. and, together, "OGX"), an event of default occurred under the Bonds. Subsequently, the O SX 3 Group entered into restructuring discussions (the "Restructuring Discussions") with the Bond Trustee and its advisers, both o f w hom have w orked in consultation with an ad hoc com m ittee o f Bondholders who together hold in excess o f 66 2/ 3% o f the Bonds (the "Ad Hoc Committee"). More recently, these restructuring discussions have involved O G X and certain of the holders of the 8.500% Senior Notes due 2018 and 8.375% Senior Notes due 2022 both issued by OGX Austria GMBH (the "OGX Noteholders") as described below.
On 24 D ecem ber 2013, OGX announced that it had entered into a plan support agreem ent with the OGX Noteholders, and it subsequently filed a plan o f reorganisation on 14 February 2014 with the Brazilian restructuring court. The plan o f reorganisation contem plates a senior secured super priority post-petition DIP financing in tw o tranches in an aggregate am ount of US$ 215 million (collectively, the "DIP Financing"). On February 7, 2014, OGX announced the entry into the DIP Financing. The proceeds o f the DIP Financing are to be used to fund capital and operating expenses o f OGX, including payment of charter rates for continued operations of the OSX 3 FPSO (the "Vessel") in accordance w ith the Proposed Restructuring.
The Vessel w as delivered by OSX 3 to OGX on 19 Novem ber 2013 and has been producing oil since Decem ber 2013.
As w as reported earlier in 2013, the oil field consultancy D eGolyer and MacNaughton certified that the Tubarao Martelo field has probable reserves o f 87.9 million barrels o f oil equivalent. This is significantly less than had been anticipated when the term s o f the charter contract as betw een OSX 3 and OGX (the "Charter Contract") had been negotiated at the tim e that the Bonds w ere issued in March 2012. Consequently, it becam e clear to all parties th a t the original charter rate was not appropriate in order fo r the Vessel to continue to operate on the Tubarao Martelo field on a com m ercially viable basis.
The Restructuring D iscussions have concluded today, and OSX 3 is pleased to announce that it has reached in principle agreem ent on the term s of the Proposed Restructuring, the key term s o f which are sum m arised below:
· Certain am endm ents to be made to the term s o f the Bonds, including not lim ited to:
o Increase to the coupon on the Bonds from 9.25% to 13.00% , to be paid in cash and to accrue from 30 October 2013;
o Paym ent to all Bondholders o f a consent fee o f 2.5% paid in the form of additional Bonds to be issued on closing;

o Inclusion o f m andatory prepaym ent events in the event o f a sale o f O S X1 or OSX2, with a m echanism for excess proceeds from these sales (subject to repaym ent in full of secured creditors at OSX1 and OSX2 and certain other obligations and retention amounts) to be applied towards prepaym ent of principal of the Bonds;
o Certain independent director rights in favou r o f the Bondholders to be introduced at the level of the OSX 3-level obligors and certain related board observer rights at O SX Leasing Group B.V.;
o Inclusion o f a buyout right in favour o f O G X in cerrtain circum stances w here the Bonds have not been refinanced at maturity.
· Certain am endm ents to be made to the Charter Contract, including but not limited to:
o The charter rate to be fixed at $250,000 per day effective from 19 Novem ber 2013;
o The inclusion of a direct right of the bond trustee under the Bonds (the "Bond Trustee") to term inate the Charter Contract (a) upon 24 m onths' notice in circum stances w here the Bonds have not been fully repaid or bought out by 20 March 2015 and (b) upon 45 days' notice, in circum stances where a non-paym ent event of default has occurred under the Bonds solely as a result o f OGX's failure to pay the charter rate under the Charter Contract (as amended);
o Am endm ents to the rights of OGX to term inate the Charter Contract to provide OGX with the right to term inate the Charter Contract effective immediately, under certain circumstances;
o Provision by O GX o f an on dem and letter o f credit for $25 million in favou r o f OSX 3 and the Bond Trustee to secure its obligations under the Charter Contract (callable in the event of a failure by OGX to pay the charte r rate under the Charter Contract (as amended)).
· It is proposed that the am endm ents to the C harter Contract be docum ented in an am endm ent and restatem ent agreem ent (the "Charter Amendment Agreement") to be entered into once B ondholder approval to the Proposed Restructuring is obtained but that the am endm ents (save for the Im m ediately Effective Amendm ents (as defined below), the "Subsequent Amendments") becom e effective only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including but not limited to the provision of the $25m letter of credit and the DIP Financing having been fully drawn by OGX. The Charter Am endm ent Agreem ent would term inate autom atically on 31 A ug ust 2014 (the "Drop-Dead Date") if these conditions have not been satisfied by then.
· It is proposed that the follow ing am endm ents becom e effective upon signing the C h arter A m endm ent Agreem ent: (a) the am endm ent fixing the charter rate at $250,000 per day effective from 19 Novem ber 2013, (b) a w aiver by OSX 3 o f the existing events of default under the C harter C ontract and (c) a subordination provision w hereby OSX 3 subordinates any claim s it may have against O G X (save for claim s for payment of the am ended charter rate) to the DIP Financing (together, the "Immediately Effective Amendments"). In the event that the Charter Am endm ent Agreem ent term inates before the Subsequent Amendm ents have becom e effective, the am endm ent fixing the charter rate would apply until the term ination date (but not thereafter, when the original charter rate shall continue to apply) but the subordination provisions would survive the term ination of the Charter Amendm ent Agreement.
For detailed term s of the Proposed Restructuring, please refer to the agreed term sheets that have been posted onto Stamdata (w w w .stam data.nol.

The agreed term sheets will also be attached to the summons to convene a meeting of Bondholders. The sum m ons is expected to be launched during the course o f the next week. If the requisite Bondholder approval is obtained at the m eeting, OSX 3 intends to enter into definitive documentation that reflects the term s of the Proposed Restructuring within short order.
