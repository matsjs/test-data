(iii) the appointment of new members o f the board of managers of NRSA in accordance with the MRTS; and
(iv) other changes to the capital structure of NRSA required to facilitate the restructuring (together, the "Resolutions").
On 31 July 2013, the shareholders of NRSA approved the Resolutions in an extraordinary general meeting.
The meeting of the board of managers of NRSA has on 31 July 2013 also approved the steps necessary to implement the final stages of the restructuring. Further to the resolutions being adopted by the board of managers of the Company, the Second Lien Bonds will be amended into the Second Lien Convertible Bonds on the terms set out in the Second Amendment and Restatement Bond Agreement dated 7 June 2013 between, amongst others, NRSA as issuer of the Second Lien Convertible Bonds and Norsk Tillitsmann ASA as bond trustee on behalf of the holders of the Second Lien Convertible Bonds (the "Second Lien Convertible Bond Agreement"), a copy of which has been made available on Stamdata.
Following the approval by the extraordinary general meeting, the terms of the First Lien Bond Agreement dated 11 June 2013, a copy of which has been made available on Stamdata, will be implemented. The subscribers of the First Lien Bonds will also receive warrants issued by NRAB which will be listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange as soon as a listing prospectus has been approved by the CSSF in Luxembourg, with shares being issued upon exercise of warrants at the end of each month.
Having obtained the requisite shareholder approvals, the Northland group is taking all steps necessary to implement the final stages of the restructuring, including making the necessary registrations in the VPS securities depository. While this process is ongoing, the Second Lien Convertible Bonds will not be tradable for a period o f two to three days.
Holders of Second Lien Convertible Bonds are reminded that, as per the terms and conditions of the Second Lien Convertible Bonds, those bonds can only be converted on an Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Second Lien Convertible Bond Agreement), the next Interest Payment Date being 15 January 2014; no action may be taken by any Second Lien Convertible Bondholder to convert their bonds before that time.
Yours sincerely,
