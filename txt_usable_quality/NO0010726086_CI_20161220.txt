Rever Offshore AS

Update to bondholders

20 December 2016

Rever Offshore AS, together with its ship owning subsidiaries Cecon Shipping 1 AS and Cecon Shipping 3 AS, (Rever) represents the shipbuilding and ship-owning business of former Cecon ASA that went into bankruptcy in April 2015.

After financial restructuring and re-financing in first quarter 2013, Rever restarted completion of three offshore construction vessels (OCV) at Chantier Davie Canada Inc (CDCI) in Quebec, Canada.
Rever took delivery of the first vessel, Cecon Pride, from CDCI in August 2014. The second vessel, Hull 718 (Cecon Excellence), was scheduled for delivery in June 2015, while the third, Cecon Sovereign (Hull 719), was commenced first half 2015 for delivery end of 2016. However, shortly before scheduled delivery of Hull 718 in May 2015, notices of substantial cost increases were received for both remaining vessels, and all ship building activities ceased while a solution was being negotiated with the yard.

Over the next 9 months, negotiations took place between Rever and CDCI, during which the term of the Rever senior bond financing was extended several times. The remaining junior bonds matured 18 March 2016, while certain of the senior bonds matured 31 March 2016 without further extension, and Rever has been in default under its bond loan agreements since.

Before defaulting under its bond loan agreements, Rever commenced discussions with both its senior and junior bondholders about a financial restructuring of the group. The discussions are now in their final stages, and a conclusion is expected in the near future. Rever has also kept a close dialogue with both junior and senior bondholders with respect to any possible solution to the deadlock situation at Davie Shipyards.

In June 2016, Rever entered into a Termination and Mutual Release and Discharge Agreement (TMRDA) with CDCI. Under the TMRDA, the completion contracts for Hull 718 and Hull 719 were terminated and the parties released each other from any obligations, claims or disputes between them. Under a new Servicing Agreement, the parties agreed to work together to preserve and prepare Hull 718 and Hull 719 for completion at another shipyard, and several alternatives are under evaluation, both in Canada and in Europe. The hull 718 has undergone preparatory work for dry towing on the semi submersible vessel Dockwise Transshelf, and left Quebec harbor 15. December.

To enable and finance the relocation and restart of the completion projects for Hull 718 and Hull 719, Cecon Shipping 3 AS has issued a further 2 MUSD of senior tranche D3 bonds, in addition to the 2 MUSD of tranche D2 bonds raised in November.
