THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE LOAN AGREEMENT:

The Company puts forward the proposal (the "Proposal") below for the Loan Agreement.

2.1. Revised amortization schedule The Company proposes to replace the current Maturity Date of 13th July 2010, on which the entire Loan Amount of NOK 2,240 million currently matures, with a new Maturity Date of 13th April 2012 and an amortization profile as described below:

NORSK TILLITSM ANN ASA

The new amortization profile shall be as follows: On 13 December 2009: NOK 500 million shall be redeemed at 103.0% of par value plus accrued interests, to be distributed between NOK 410.5 million in the Fixed Rate Tranche and NOK 89.5 million in the FRN Tranche, On 13 July 2010: NOK 500 million shall be redeemed at 103.0% of par value plus accrued interests, to be distributed between NOK 410.5 million in the Fixed Tranche and NOK 89.5 million in the FRN Tranche, On 13 July 2011: 50% of the outstanding amount as of 13 July 2010 shall be redeemed at 107.0% of par value plus accrued interests, to be distributed between 82% in the Fixed Tranche and 18% in the FRN Tranche, and On 13 April 2012: the remaining Loan shall be redeemed at 107.0% of par value plus accrued interests.
Notwithstanding the wording above, if amounts of the Loan are paid back as a consequence of some or all of the Bondholders exercising their put options (and with subsequent discharge of the relevant Bonds), such aggregated amount shall be deducted from the next repayment for the relevant Tranche (and if such required repayment is less than the amount putted by the Bondholders, from the then following repayments).
Partial repayment will be carried out pro rata between the Bonds (according to the procedures of the Security Depository). In order to carry out the partial redemption pro rata, there will be a split of each Bond so that the new face value will be NOK 1.0.
2.1.1. Revised call option schedule The revised call option schedule shall be as follow:
The Borrower may redeem parts of the Loan or the entire Loan as follows, always provided that the relative portion redeemed in the Fixed Tranche and the FRN Tranche shall be proportional:
anytime from the date the Proposal is effective to and including 13 July 2010 at 103% of par plus accrued interests on the redeemed amount, anytime from, but not included, 13 July 2010 to and including 13 April 2012 at 107% of par plus accrued interests on the redeemed amount.
2.1.2. Revised put option schedule The put option levels shall be adjusted to reflect the revised call option levels being valid at any time a put option event is triggered.
2.1.3. New share pledge on Siri Holding The Company proposes to add a new share pledge to the security package for the Bonds, meaning that the Bonds shall also be secured by a share pledge over the Company's shares in Siri Flolding Limited, a 100% owned UK subsidiary of the Borrower holding 100% of the shares in Siri UK Limited which again owns a 30% interest in the producing Siri field in Denmark.

The Borrower's shares in Siri Holding Limited shall be blocked and pledged on first priority in favor of the Loan Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders). Please be aware that in connection with a winding up or forced liquidation of the Borrower the new share pledge on Siri Holding can be considered as security for old debt and it may be set aside.

2.1.4. Revised Group oil price hedging The revised oil price hedge clause shall be as follows:

The Borrower shall maintain its oil price hedge program which is currently in place as outlined below:

Put options
Period IQ 2009 2Q 2009 3Q2009 4Q 2009 IQ 2010 2Q 2010 3Q2010 4Q2010 1Q 2011

2.1.5. Revised Exploration Restriction Event The revised Exploration Restriction Event shall be as follows:

If the Group reports more than NOK 800 million of expensed dry well costs (meaning exploration costs resulting from dry wells) after tax in aggregate for the duration of the Loan (from and including 3Q 2007 to and including IQ 2012).

3. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES 3.1. The Company's evaluation

Noreco is continuously seeking to grow the Company and to strengthen its position as a significant oil and gas company in the North Sea region. In order to achieve this goal it is important to secure the long term financial stability of the Company regardless of the financial and industrial market conditions. The Proposal represents a significant step in this direction and it will provide Noreco with the necessary flexibility and conditions to continue building a stronger company as well as time to explore various alternatives which will further improve the financial strength of the Company.

Noreco proposes to impose an aggressive amortization profile whereby approximately half of the Loan is repaid within the current maturity date at 3% premium to par value. In addition the remaining Loan will be repaid through two installments in July 2011 and April 2012 at an

as possible. Altogether the proposed changes represent in excess of NOK 116 million in additional cash payment to the Bondholders in return for a partial extension of the Loan. The Proposal results in significant reduction of leverage over the next 15 months and Noreco is committed to further strengthen the Company's capital structure by active portfolio management including realizing asset values through divestments. In Noreco's view, all the Company's stakeholders will benefit from these measures and the Proposal underlines Noreco's strong commitment to deleverage the Company.
Noreco is taking its available cash generated on back of strong operational performance by offering NOK 500 million of the Loan for redemption in 2009. Furthermore, downside protection of the oil price through put options at 75 and 50 USD per barrel is already in place which provides Noreco with healthy cash flow regardless of the oil price movements. The Company intends to further extend this hedging program when the market conditions stabilize (and the insurance cost through put options become more attractive). Noreco wants to ensure its Bondholders that the Company is doing its best effort to redeem as much as possible of the Loan as soon as possible without jeopardizing the Company's financial health during a period with very challenging market conditions. The Company will continue to pursue various funding sources such as asset sales to further repay Bonds and deleverage the Company, thereby allocating as much cash as possible to the Bondholders in advance of current maturity of the Loan in July 2010.
3.2. NTM's evaluation
The Bondholders themselves must evaluate, based on all information available with respect to the Company, whether the Proposal should be accepted. It implies that each bondholder has to consider the fairness of the Proposal, evaluating the partial early redemption of the Loan together with the increased premiums against the extension of the Maturity Date. In the opinion of the Loan Trustee, the Proposal gives the Company an incentive to redeem the Loan as soon as possible due to the proposed step up of premiums. The partial redemption of the Loan in November 2008 and the incentive scheme presented in the Proposal, show, in the opinion of the Loan Trustee, the Company's intention to deleverage the Company as well as that the Company is willing to pay a premium back to the Bondholders.
According to Clauses 16.1 and 17.8 of the Loan Agreement, the proposed amendments require the approval of the Bondholders.
It is recommended that the Bondholders consult with tax and other advisers as to the possible consequences of the Proposal. All Bondholders must be aware that even if the Proposal is accepted, the Company still has challenges going forward and the Company might be unable to meet its commitments in the future.

EXHIBIT 1: BACKGROUND
The following information regarding the operational and financial status o f the Company is provided by the Company. The Loan Trustee expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever in connection with such information givenfrom the Company.
Update on the Company
Since the Bonds were issued in July 2007, Noreco has completed the acquisition and integration of Altinex ASA which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Noreco. The Company has delivered solid operational performance and strengthened its financial position by issuing new equity to acquire more producing assets. Nine out of the first eleven exploration and appraisal wells the Company has participated in to date have been successful, creating significant value which can be further monetized through field development or asset sales. Management is also very pleased with delivering strong production growth from the underlying assets which was -40% above the Company's 2008 guidance. The strong production is expected to continue and the Company has guided an average daily production in excess of 14.000 barrels of oil equivalents per day in 2009.
The reserve audit for year end 2008 shows that Noreco has added 7.5 million barrels oil equivalents of 2P reserves (Proven + Probable) which gives a strong Reserve Replacement Ratio for 2008 of 145%. Further reserve additions are expected from the Company's contingent resources (102 million barrels oil equivalents per 1 January 2008). The Nini East field was sanctioned by the Danish authorities in 2008 and will add in excess of 3,000 barrels per day net to the Company in 4Q this year. The large Huntington field is the next field expected to come on-stream in 2010. In addition the Plan for Development and Operation ("PDO") for Oselvar was submitted to Norwegian authorities on Monday 9th of March, adding 7.8 mmboe of 2P reserves net to Noreco. Production from these fields, in addition to optimization of production from existing fields, is expected to yield further production growth.
Looking back, Noreco has successfully raised in excess of NOK 1,200 million in new equity in connection with the IPO, acquisition of 30% interest in the producing Siri license in Denmark and through conversion of convertible bonds. On back of Noreco's strong operational performance the Company made an early redemption of 20% of the Loan in November 2008 thereby reducing the outstanding Loan amount to NOK 2,240 million. Noreco is deeply committed to take an active approach managing its capital structure which is exemplified by the repayment of more than NOK 1 billion of bonds in 2008. In light of this, Noreco believes that the amendment proposal outlined in this summons shows the Company's commitment to repay as much of the Loan as possible with its available cash as soon as possible in return for an extension of part of the Loan at substantial premiums. The Company believes that the proposal is an attractive offer for its Bondholders whereas it simultaneously creates financial stability for the Company.
