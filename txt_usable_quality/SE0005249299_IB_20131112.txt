Information to the holders of certificates under Rederi AB TransAtlantic's Swedish certificate loan
On 5 November the general meeting resolved upon a rights issue amounting to SEK 147,870,264 (based on a subscription ratio where three existing shares entitle to subscription for one new share).
The amount is less than is required under the company's SEK 140,000,000 senior unsecured callable fixed rate certificate loan 2013 (ISIN: SE0005249299) which required a rights issue of no less than SEK 150,000,000. In connection with the rights issue, the company has transferred an amount corresponding to the difference between the expected proceeds of the rights issue and SEK 150,000,000 to a bank account pledged to the trustee and the holders of certificates.
In light of the aforementioned the trustee, Swedish Trustee AB (publ), has on behalf of the holders of the certificates granted the company a waiver. This waiver applies to the undertaking in the terms and conditions of the certificate loan pursuant to which the general meeting of the company should resolve on or approve (as applicable) a rights issue amounting to not less than SEK 150,000,000.
