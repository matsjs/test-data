NORSK TILLITSM ANN ASA
Overview of the Restructuring l" st Cecon (and its subsidiaries Cecon ,1 and Cecon 2) are currently seeking to undergo a restructuring process whereby (i) the Loans will be restructured by reducing the principal amounts of the Loans in exchange, for an issuance of shares to the Bondholders, (ii) certain of the economic and other terms of the Loans will be amended, and (iii) a new loan will be made to Cecon in the amount of USD 5-7 million with warrants attached. The main principles for this restructuring and the terms thereof are set out in a Term Sheet dated 8 October 2010 (the "Term Sheet") agreed among Cecon, certain of its shareholders and certain individual Bondholders (the "Restructuring"). The Term Sheet is enclosed as Exhibit 1 to the summons.
The Term Sheet will in brief have the following effects on the Bondholders and the Loans:
i Cecon will issue a new loan of between USD 5 and 7 million to certain existing bondholders and shareholders (the "New Loan"). The New Loan will have a term of two years and collect 5% interest. The subscribers to the New Loan shall be entitled to receive a total of 65 million warrants, each of which will entitle the holder to subscribe for one share in Cecon (the "Warrants"). The initial exercise price for the Warrants is NOK 0.65 per share. The New Loan will be issued as a new tranche under the 2007/2012 Loan Agreement as amended in the Restructuring. The New Loan will rank senior to the bonds remaining under the 2007/2012 Loan and the 2009/2010 Loan after the Restructuring.
ii The 2009/2010 Loan will be partially cancelled, together with all of the accrued, unpaid interest on the 2009/2010 Loan since 30 April 2010, against issuance of shares by Cecon to the 2009 Bondholders and holders of unpaid coupons (as the case may be). Following the cancellation, USD 8,125,000 of the 2009/2010 Loan will remain and will be exchanged for bonds under the 2007/2012 Loan governed by the 2007/2012 Loan Agreement as amended under the Restructuring. The borrowers under the 2007/2012 Loan are Cecon 1 and Cecon 2 and the transactions accordingly involve a change of borrower for the 2009/2010 Loan.
iii The 2007/2012 Loan will be partially cancelled, together with all of the accrued, unpaid interest on the 2007/2012 Loan since 5 November 2009, against issuance of shares by Cecon to the 2007 Bondholders and holders of unpaid coupons (as the case may be). Following the cancellation, USD 65,000,000 of the 2007/2012 Loan will remain under the 2007/2012 Loan governed by the 2007/2012 Loan Agreement as amended under the Restructuring.
iv The Bondholders who choose to participate in the New Loan will have a portion of their bonds in the remaining Loans elevated so that they rank junior to the New Loan but senior to the rest of the remaining Loans.
v Mr. Riulf Rustad will be entitled to a restructuring fee of USD 1 million, which will be paid through the issuance of bonds issued pursuant to the 2007/2012 Loan Agreement as amended under the Restructuring. These bonds will rank pari passu with the most junior of the bonds in the remaining Loans.
vi The bonds in the remaining parts of the Loans and the bonds issued to Mr. Riulf Rustad will mature five years after closing of the Restructuring and will carry an
L 2038353 V I 02.12.10 505587-016

NORSK TILLITSM ANN ASA
annual interest of 8% until 'fepdid'rf Interest on these bonds will be payable in kind during the first year following the closing of the Restructuring.
Further details of the terms of the Restructuring, including the security that is to be provided to secure the Loans and the New Loan following the restructuring, are outlined in the Term Sheet.
Participation in the New Loan Any Bondholder that wishes to subscribe for its pro rata share of the bonds in the New Loan should contact Ivar Halvorsen at Cecon (by e-mail to ivar.halvorsen@cecon.no) by 16 December 2010 at 14.00 (Oslo time). The bonds in the New Loan will be subject to a minimum subscription amount of the USD equivalent of 50,000 (the "Minimum Subscription Amount"), and if a Bondholder's pro rata share is less than the Minimum Subscription Amount, the principal amount of the bonds in the New Loan allocated to that Bondholder will be rounded to zero or the Minimum Subscription Amount, whichever is closer to that holder's pro rata share.
Ongoing processes The Company and the Trustee are currently discussing the further details of the transactions and the amendments to the 2007/2012 Loan Agreement required in order to finalise the documentation required to effectuate the Restructuring.
Cecon has called an extraordinary shareholders meeting on 10 December 2010 for the purpose of resolving the issuance of the Warrants. The Board of Cecon will apply an existing authorisation from the shareholders to increase the share capital by issuance of 49,500,000 new shares for the purpose of partial settlement of the Loans as set out in the Term Sheet.
To enable Cecon to conduct the Restructuring as described in the Term Sheet, Cecon has requested the Loan Trustee to summon Bondholders' meetings in respect of each of the 2007/2012 Loan Agreement and the 2009/2010 Loan Agreement to consider the approval of the conditions for the Restructuring and the Term Sheet.
Trustee's disclaimer/non-reliance Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders of Loan Trustee or its advisors. Bondholders should independently evaluate the Restructuring and vote accordingly.
The information in this summons regarding the Borrowers and Cecon and market conditions is provided by the said companies, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

NON-BINDING INDICATIVE TERM SHEET FOR THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF
CECONASA

I. Introduction

This term sheet (the "Term Sheet"), dated__October 2010, sets out the key terms for a proposed financial restructuring (the "Restructuring") of certain of the liabilities of Cecon ASA (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (such subsidiaries, together with the Company, "Cecon"). The provisions of this Term Sheet (a) are not exhaustive, and (b) other than sections 17 and 18, are indicative only and shall not create any binding legal obligations on, or compromise any of the legal rights of, the holders (the "Secured Bondholders") of the USD100 million 11.0 per cent senior secured callable and putable bond issue 2007/2012 (the "Secured Bonds") initially issued by the Company and subsequently assumed by Cecon Shipping 1 AS and Cecon Shipping 2 AS (the "Issuers") unless and until the transactions contemplated by this Term Sheet are approved by the holders of the Secured Bonds and the 2009 Bonds at bondholder meetings. If the transactions contemplated by this Term Sheet are so approved, implementation of those transactions will be conditioned on the Loan Trustee being satisfied that the conditions set out in paragraph 15 of this Term Sheet have been fulfilled.

Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalised terms used in this Term Sheet shall have the meaning given to them in the loan agreement between the Company and Norsk Tillitsmann ASA as the Loan Trustee relating to the Secured Bonds dated 30 April 2007 (as amended by Amendment Agreement No. 1 dated 20 February 2008, the "Secured Bond Loan Agreement").

At the closing of the Restructuring (the "Closing"):
· USD 35,000,000 in principal amount of the Secured Bonds, together with all accrued and unpaid interest on the Secured Bonds up to the date of the Closing, will be transferred to the Company and exchanged for new shares in the Company as described in "New Shares" below (the "Exchange of Secured Bonds"); and
® the Secured Bond Loan Agreement will be amended and restated (as so amended and restated, the "Amended and Restated Bond Loan Agreement") and the remaining USD 65,000,000 in principal amount of the Secured Bonds will be (a) transferred to the Issuers as payment of the purchase price of Tranche B Bonds and (b) amended and restated as Tranche Cl Bonds, in an aggregate principal amount of USD 65,000,000, as described in "Tranche B

L 2038214 V I 02.12.10 505587-016

Bonds" and "Tranche C Bonds" below.

2. Restructuring of the 2009 Bonds At the Closing:

· USD 4,375,000 in principal amount of the Company's 25% Cecon ASA Secured Bonds Issue 2009/2010 (the "2009 Bonds"), together with all accrued and unpaid interest on the 2009 Bonds up to the date of the Closing, will be exchanged for new shares in the Company as described in "New Shares" below (together with the Exchange of Secured Bonds, the "Debt for Equity Swap"); and

· the remaining USD 8,125,000 in principal amount of the 2009 Bonds will be (a) transferred to the Issuers of the Secured Bonds and used as payment of the purchase price of Tranche B Bonds and (b) exchanged for Tranche C2 Bonds issued by the Issuers pursuant to the Amended and Restated Bond Loan Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount of USD 8,125,000, as described in "Tranche B Bonds" and "Tranche C Bonds" below.

3. Tranche A Bonds

The Amended and Restated Bond Loan Agreement will provide for the issuance by the Company USD5,000,000 - 7,000,000 of Tranche A Bonds, all of which will be issued at the Closing.

The Tranche A Bonds will be subscribed for in a private placement transaction. Each such subscriber shall also subscribe, on a pro rata basis, for warrants to purchase shares in the Company as described in "Warrants" below, and each such subscriber that is a holder of Secured Bonds or 2009 Bonds shall also subscribe, on a pro rata basis, for Tranche B Bonds (as described in "Tranche B Bonds" below).

It is anticipated that the Company will obtain back-stop commitments in respect of USD5,000,000 of Tranche A Bonds to be issued at Closing, of which USD2,000,000 of commitments will be provided by certain holders of the Secured Bonds and USD3,000,000 of commitments will be provided by certain holders of shares in the Company.

Not less than USD2,000,000 and not more than USD4,000,000 of the Tranche A Bonds to be issued at Closing will be available for subscription by holders of the 2009 Bonds (the "2009 Bondholders") and Secured Bondholders. The Tranche A Bonds available for

L 2038214 V I 02.12.10 505587-016

4. Tranche B Bonds

subscription by holders of the Secured Bonds and 2009 Bonds will be allocated among participating holders on a pro rata basis with a minimum subscription amount of the USD equivalent of 650,000 (the "Minimum Subscription Amount"). If a holder's pro rata share is less than the Minimum Subscription Amount, the principal amount of Tranche A Bonds allocated to that holder will be rounded to zero or the Minimum Subscription Amount, whichever is closer to that holder's pro rata share.
Holders of Secured Bonds and 2009 Bonds who subscribe for, and purchase, Tranche A Bonds at Closing are referred to as "Participating Bondholders".
The Tranche A Bonds shall have a two year term and shall otherwise be on economic terms satisfactory to the Secured Bondholders.
The holders from time to time of the Tranche A Bonds issued at Closing will have pre-emptive rights in respect of any future issuances of Tranche A Bonds.
The Amended and Restated Bond Loan Agreement will provide for the issuance by the Issuers of Tranche B Bonds in a principal amount equal to (A) USD112,500,000, multiplied by (B) the principal amount of Tranche A Bonds issued to Participating Bondholders at Closing, divided by (C) the principal amount of Tranche A Bonds issued at Closing.
The Tranche B Bonds will be subscribed for by Participating Bondholders pro rata based on their subscriptions for Tranche A Bonds.
As payment of the subscription price for the Tranche B Bonds, the Participating Bondholders will transfer to the Company 2009 Bonds and/or Secured Bonds (as applicable) in a like principal amount.
Any Participating Bondholder that does not hold sufficient 2009 Bonds and Secured Bonds to purchase its lull pro rata share of the Tranche B Bonds will purchase Tranche B Bonds in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of 2009 Bonds and/or Secured Bonds that it holds, and the aggregate principal amount of Tranche B Bonds issued at the Closing shall be reduced by the difference between that Participating Bondholder's pro rata share of the Tranche B Bonds and the actual principal amount of Tranche B Bonds purchased by that Participating Bondholder.

· the Secured Bonds held by a Secured Bondholder will be amended and restated to consist of Tranche Cl Bonds in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of Secured Bonds held by that Secured Bondholder after giving effect to the Debt for Equity Swap and the issuance of Tranche B Bonds to that Secured Bondholder (if any);
· the 2009 Bonds held by a 2009 Bondholder will be amended and restated to consist of Tranche C2 Bonds in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of 2009 Bonds held by that 2009 Bondholder after giving effect to the Debt for Equity Swap and the issuance of Tranche B Bonds to that 2009 Bondholder (if any); and
· USD 1,000,000 of additional Tranche C2 Bonds will be issued to Mr. Riulf Rustad (or his nominee) as payment for services rendered in connection with the Restructuring, with such issuance conditioned upon Mr. Rustad (or such nominee) entering into a lock-up undertaking for the benefit of the Company, the Secured Bondholders and the 2009 Bondholders, pursuant to which Mr. Rustad (or such nominee) will agree not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of such Tranche C2 Bonds for a period of two years from the date of issuance.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Tranche Cl Bonds shall not be a new issuance, but shall be an amendment and restatement of the Secured Bonds.
The Tranche Cl Bonds and the Tranche C2 Bonds (together, the "Tranche C Bonds") and the Tranche B Bonds (the Tranche B Bonds and the Tranche C Bonds, together, the "Restructured Bonds") shall each have a 5-year term, and shall accrue interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum, with interest payable quarterly.

® a first priority charge on any intercompany debts owing to the Company and a second priority charge on any intercompany debts owing to the Issuers (it being understood that such charge shall not limit Cecon's ability to create or repay such intercompany debts or restrict the use of proceeds of such intercompany debts, in each case prior to the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default); and
· second ranking security over all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuers.
Supplemental security shall be granted to the extent necessary to give effect to the security arrangements described in the preceding paragraph (it being acknowledged that, subject to advice from local counsel, it may be necessary to re-take some of the existing security for the Secured Bonds).
The Restructured Bonds and the Tranche A Bonds shall rank, and the proceeds of any enforcement of the Security or any of the guarantees shall be applied, in the following order:

The Warrants will be immediately exerciseable, will have a two-year term and an initial exercise price of NOKO.65 and will benefit from customary anti-dilution protection in accordance with the Loan Trustee's standard terms for bonds with Warrants, on terms to be agreed. The Warrants will be listed on Oslo Axess.
As consideration for the cancelation of indebtedness contemplated by the Debt for Equity Swap, 49,500,000 new shares in the Company (the "New Shares"), representing approximately 33,33% of the pro-forma post-Restructuring share capital of the Company (calculated on a fully-diluted basis) shall be issued on a pro rata basis to the holders of the Secured Bonds and the 2009 Bonds. The New Shares will be listed on Oslo Axess.
