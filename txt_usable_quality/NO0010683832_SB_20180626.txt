8.875 per cent Latina Offshore Limited Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2013/2018

Oslo, 26 June 2018
Notice of a Written Bondholders' Resolution
Nordic Trustee AS (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") issued by Latina Offshore Limited (the "Company" or "Issuer").
Unless otherwise stated, capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement originally entered into on 3 July 2013, as amended and restated on 11 October 2013 and further amended on 5 September 2016 and as amended and restated on 10 October 2017 (the "Bond Agreement").
The Issuer has requested that the Bond Trustee issue this request for a written Bondholders' resolution pursuant to Clause 16.5 (Written Resolution) of the Bond Agreement to consider approval of the Proposed Resolution (as defined below).
The information in this notice regarding the Issuer and the described transactions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
Bondholders are encouraged to read this notice in its entirety.
1 BACKGROUND
Reference is made to the upcoming final maturity date of the Bond Issue which currently is 3 July 2018 (the "Maturity Date"). To facilitate the conclusions of certain ongoing discussions, the Issuer proposes that the Bondholders agree to an extension of the Maturity Date, by temporarily waiving the payment obligation with respect to principal amounts due on the Maturity Date (including for the avoidance of doubt the instalment originally due on 3 January 2018), until 1 October 2018 (the "Maturity Waiver", and the period between the Maturity Date and 1 October 2018, the "Waiver Period").
During the Waiver Period, all terms of the Bond Agreement, including accrual of interest, will continue on an unaffected basis. For the avoidance of doubt, interest due and payable on the Maturity Date will be paid in full on 3 July 2018. Interest will continue to accrue during the Waiver Period, such interest to be paid at the earlier of 1 October 2018 or the redemption of the Bond Issue.
