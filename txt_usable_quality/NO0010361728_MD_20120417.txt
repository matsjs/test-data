FRN Rubicon Offshore Holdings Ltd Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2014

Oslo, 17 April 2012

Notice to Bondholders - Extension of Grace Period

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM" or the "Loan Trustee") acts as the Loan Trustee for the Bondholders in respect of the loan mentioned above (the "Loan" or the "Bonds") made available under a loan agreement dated 11 April 2007, as amended on 10 March 2011 "FRN Rubicon Offshore Holdings Ltd Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2014" (the "Loan Agreement") with ISIN NO 001 036172.8 and entered into between the Loan Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) and Rubicon Offshore Holdings Ltd as borrower (the "Borrower" or the "Company").

All capitalised terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Loan Agreement.

Under clause 10.1(a) of the Loan Agreement, the Company is required to make an Amortization Payment of USD 15,000,000 on the Interest Payment Date falling in April 2012 (such Interest Payment Date being 16 April 2012). Failure to make payment of the Amortization Payment on 16 April 2012 will, after at experience of the 5 Banking Days' grace period (the "Grace Period"), give rise to an Event of Default under clause 15.1(a) of the Loan Agreement.

The Company does not currently have sufficient funds available to it to pay this Amortization Payment. The Company is therefore in discussions with an informal ad hoc committee of Bondholders (the "Committee") which together hold in excess of 66 %% of the principal amount of the outstanding Bonds, in relation to a possible restructuring of the terms of the Loan.

Reference is made to the summons of dated 17 April 2012 regarding an extension of the Amortization Payment due in April to 16 May 2012 (the "Extension"). The Bondholders' Meeting will be held on 26 April 2012. The Loan Trustee hereby grants an extension of the Grace Period to expire on 26 April 2012, or to any date before that if the Loan Trustee gives a 1 Banking Days' written notice of the expiry of the Grace Period.

All our rights and the rights of the Bondholders in respect of the Bonds and the Loan Agreement are hereby reserved, the Grace Period and any other breaches of defaults which may have arisen under the Bonds.

Yours sincerely,

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
