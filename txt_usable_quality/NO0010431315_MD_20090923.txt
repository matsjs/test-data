To the bondholders in: ISIN: NO 001043131.5 - FRN Master Marine ASA Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2008/2011 (the "Bonds") Oslo, 23 September 2009 Bondholders constituting over 57.66 % of the holdings of the Bonds issued by Master Marine ASA (the "Company") have notified Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, the Trustee for and on behalf of the holders of the Bonds, that they intend to vote against the proposal from Nordic Capital VII Limited (the "Proposal") outlined in the notice dated 18 September 2009 requisitioning a meeting of holders of the Bonds to be held on 28 September 2009. The holders of the Bonds who have notified the Trustee that they intend to vote against the Proposal consider that it does not ascribe fair value to Master Marine's two service vessels under construction at Drydocks World in Batam and the charter contracts for their use. They are supportive of any efforts on the part of the Company's management to find a solution which will provide fair value and is acceptable to the Company's key stakeholders, and welcome alternative proposals from any party.
