Information to Bondholders

Oslo, 16 March 2016

Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") is acting as bond trustee for the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue") where Harkand Finance Inc. is the issuer (the "Issuer").
The Bond Trustee has notified the Issuer that the Bonds have been declared to be in default, and that the Bond Trustee has exercised its rights to replace the board of directors of the Issuer and its two subsidiaries Harkand Atlantis Inc. and Harkand Da Vinci Inc.
Irrespective of the replacement of the current board of directors, the Issuer continues to discuss with the Bond Trustee (on behalf of Bondholders) a consensual solution that would render the Issuer and its subsidiaries solvent.
The Bond Trustee has for now not declared the Bonds to be due for immediate payment. However, all rights and remedies which the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) may have are reserved.

Yours sincerely, Nordic Trustee ASA
