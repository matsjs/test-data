IGas Energy Plc ("IGas" or "the Company") (AIM: IGAS) Result of voluntary cash offer to secured bondholders
Further to the announcement by IGas and the Buy-Back Offer Letter published on Stamdata on 17 March 2017, the deadline for making offers under the Voluntary Cash Offer expired at 13:00 hours CET on 31 March 2017.
The Company hereby confirms that the aggregate face value of Secured Bonds offered in the Voluntary Cash Offer was US$71.4 million (after adjustment for the mandatory pro rata equity exchange). Pursuant to the terms of the Voluntary Cash Offer, and subject to completion of the restructuring proposed by the Company (the "Restructuring"), the Company has conditionally accepted offers to buy-back Secured Bonds with an aggregate face value of US$49.2 million. Settlement of the Voluntary Cash Offer is conditional upon completion of the Restructuring and the occurrence of Admission on or before 28 April 2017 (as defined in the Summons). Settlement is expected to occur on 7 April 2017, at which time payment in cash will be made to those bondholders whose offers have been accepted by the Company in consideration for the Bonds being repurchased by the Company. Since the US$49.2 minimum cash cancellation (the Secured Bond Cash Cancellation Minimum) threshold has been exceeded, no Conditional Cash Cancellation (as defined in the Summons) will take place upon completion of the Restructuring. This announcement will be published at Newsweb and be available at www.stamdata.no. Requests for more information may be directed to the manager of the Voluntary Cash Offer:
