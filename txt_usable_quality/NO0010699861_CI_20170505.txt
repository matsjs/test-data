BOARD OF DIRECTORS' REPORT - 2016

The company

The North Alliance AS (NOA) is a group of companies offering services within communication, design and technology. The family of companies operates in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Poland and USA.

The group includes the following companies: - Making Waves (NO, SE, PL, US) - Akestam Holst (SE) - Bold (SE, DK, NO) - Promenad (SE) - Great Works (SE, DK) - AndCo (DK) - Anorak (NO)

Design & Technology Communication Design Action Marketing and CRM Digital strategy and innovation Communication Communication

In January 2016 NOA acquired the Swedish/American technology and design company Nansen, with over 100 employees in Stockholm, Chicago and New York. In Q3 an operational merger was completed with Making Waves.

NOA has closed down operations of StudioNoc in Q4 2016. Main reasons are low performance and limited synergies with other companies in the NOA group.

Financial results

Total operating revenue for the year amounted to 984.9 MNOK. Total net revenue for the year amounted to 721.8 MNOK. This represents 35,1 % growth compared to the 2015 group revenue figures. Group EBITDA for the year came in at 41.5 MNOK. Adjusted for transaction costs and one-offs, EBITDA for the year was 66.2 MNOK.

The North Alliance has seen a satisfactory operational cash conversion. The cash flow has been affected by financing and investing activities. Main effect is cash used for investing activities, including acquisition of fixed assets. Finance cost, depreciations and changes in working capital have been the most important elements affecting the cash flow from operating activities.

The group has a strong cash position at 31.12.2016.

The Company's (holding) income in 2016 was MNOK 15.1 and is solely related to intercompany management services (2015: MNOK 15.2). The operating loss was MNOK -4.3 (2015: -1.4) and the annual result after tax was MNOK -1.3 (2015: -2.2).

It is proposed that NoA's loss for the year after tax should be allocated as follows (MNOK):

Dividend

Transferred from other equity________ 1.3

Total allocated

Total equity for the NoA Group per 31.12.2016 was MNOK 396.8 and total assets were 795.2 MNOK.

Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern assumption. This assessment is based on the group's expectations for 2017, a satisfactory liquidity position and undrawn credit facilities. The Board of Directors believes that the financial statements provide a fair presentation of NoA's assets and liabilities, financial position and results.
Subsequent events
No significant subsequent events
External environment
The group does not produce goods or services that use environmentally hazardous input factors. The environmental awareness of the group's main suppliers is assessed as part of the group's procurement process.
Employees and working environment
The group attaches great importance to health, safety and environment, and activities in this area are organised by the working environment committee, the sports and recreation organisation and HR. Cooperation with the employees' organisations has been satisfactory. The sickness absence rate for the group was in average 3 .5 % during 2016 compared to 6 % in 2015. The group is constantly working to reduce the sickness absence rate. No working accidents were reported during 2016. Many nationalities are represented both in Norway and abroad, and the employees work well together. The group has a recruitment and HR policy that -ensures equal -opportunities and rights, while preventing discrimination.
Equal opportunities
In 2016, NoA had an average of 665 employees, 3 8 % of them women. At the end of 2016 the group's Board of Directors had six members elected by shareholders, all men. The group's administrative management consisted of one woman and three men in 2016. Of the group's subsidiaries, 3 0 % are headed by women and 7 0 % by men.
Research and development
The group does not have any costs that are classified as research and development. It nevertheless commits substantial resources to developing its activities in digital technologies platforms. This is a constant area of focus but all of these costs have currently been expensed in the income statement.
Corporate governance and company management
NoA aims to follow the recommendations of the Oslo Stock Exchange and NUES with regard to good corporate governance and company management. A good reputation and good financial development are prerequisites for building and maintaining confidence among important target groups such as shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers, partners and public authorities. This requires that the company will be managed using good control and management mechanisms. Open, honest communication and equal treatment of the company's share- and bondholders are also important when it comes to increasing value and inspiring confidence. The company has rules and guidelines for the Board of Directors and the CEO. Refer

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
to the company website for further reporting on corporate governance and control.
Work of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors regularly receives a group-reporting package containing financial information on the group and the individual group companies. The Board also regularly receives management's comments on developments during the year. The company's strategy is discussed on a broad basis at an extended Board Meeting every year. There is also a rotating review of subsidiaries at individual Board Meetings. The Board of Directors evaluate their work annually.
Risk management and internal control
The group is exposed to various types of financial risk linked to ordinary operations. In the short term this involves unpredictable advertising markets in particular, but also technical business interruptions and distribution. The group therefore has comprehensive systems in place for monitoring and dealing with such situations.
The group is exposed to risks associated with operations in several foreign currencies. This risk is assessed continuously. Exposures to currency exchange rates arise from the Group's overseas sales, which are primarily denominated in SEK, DKK, USD and PLN. See note 2 "Segment information" for a split of the Group's revenue and trade receivables. The sales and trade receivables for each segment are in all materiality in local currencies. Furthermore, the carrying amount of the Group's net investments in foreign companies fluctuates in Norwegian kroner compared to the local relevant currencies.
The Group is exposed to credit risk for trade and other receivables. The group focuses on outstanding receivables and the Board of Directors judges the risk of significant losses to be relatively small. Historically losses have been insignificant.
Through the listed bond loan with floating rate the group is exposed to interest rate risk that may affect the cash flow.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group's strategy for managing liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient liquid funds at all times to meet its financial obligations, both under normal and extraordinary circumstances, without risking unacceptable losses or damaging its reputation. The Group has large fluctuations related to restricted working capital due to seasonality and the timing of deliveries and payments.
The group's financial risks are further described in note 15.
Remuneration of senior employees
NoA attaches importance to being an attractive employer. The company wants to attract skilled employees with relevant experience. The company therefore aims to have a competitive remuneration system.
Auditor
The group uses the same audit firm for all its major subsidiaries in all the markets where it is active. The overall auditing quote is discussed and approved by the Board of Directors and CEO. The auditor is not used as a consultant for strategic matters. The CFO approves any consultancy assignments. The auditor attends the Board Meeting at which the financial statements are discussed.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 - Accounting Principles
General information
The North Alliance AS is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Norway with offices at Kristian IV's gate 15 in Oslo.
B asis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements for The North Alliance AS ("the Group") are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and required for the financial year beginning 1 January 2016 or later, as well as Norwegian disclosure requirements pursuant to the Accounting Act per 31 December 2016.
Comparative figures for the income statement have also been prepared for 31 December 2015.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through equity or the statement of income.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and events under sim ilar conditions.
Basis of consolidation
(a) S u b sid iarie s
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has control. The group controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the group. The consideration transferred includes the air value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the recognized amounts of acquiree's identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
12 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognized in the income statement.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the group is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognized in accordance with IAS 39 either in the income statement or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognized and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognized directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group com panies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated. When necessary amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the group's accounting policies.
(b) C h a n g e s in ow nership interests in su b sid ia rie s w ithout change of control
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions - that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
(c) D isp o sal of su b sid ia rie s
When the group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is re- measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognized in the income statement. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement.
Foreign currency translation
a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional
13 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
currency'). The functional currency is mainly NOK, SEK, USD and DKK. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Norwegian Kroner ("NOK"), which is the group's presentation currency.
(b) T ran sa ctio n s and b alan ces
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the income statement. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within 'finance income or costs'.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in the income statement as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equities classified as available for sale, are included in other comprehensive income.
(c) G roup co m p an ie s
The results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: · assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the
date of that balance sheet; · income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; · all resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.
Revenue recognition
The group sells services within marketing communication, design and technology. For sales of services, revenue is recognized in the accounting period in which the services are rendered. This is done by (1) reference to stage of completion of the specific transaction and assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total service to be provided or (2) based on hours booked for time and material contracts.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, adjusted for any trade discounts or volume rebates allowed by the group. Revenue is recognized only when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
When the outcome of a transaction involving rendering of services can be measured reliably, revenue associated with the transaction is recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period. The outcome of a transaction is considered to be reliably measured when all of the following conditions are met;
(a) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; (b) it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity;
14 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
(c) stage of completion can be measured reliably; and (d) the costs incurred and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably.
Segm ent reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the steering committee that makes strategic decisions.
The steering committee considers the business from a geographic perspective. This is the performance of the segment Norway, Sweden, USA and Denmark. Holding com panies are included as they are administrative centers.
Income tax Tax expense recognized in the statement of income comprises the sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claim from, fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior reporting periods, that are unpaid at the reporting date. The calculation of current tax is based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Management continuously reviews the positions that are claimed in the tax returns where the applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. Based on these evaluations, provisions for anticipated tax payments are made, as necessary.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, or on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be utilized against future taxable income, based on the Group's forecast of future operating results which are adjusted for significant non-taxable income and expenses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when the Group has a right and intention to set off current tax assets and liabilities from the same taxation authority.
Fixed assets
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) is recognized when the cost of an asset can be reliably measured and it is probable that the entity will obtain future economic benefits from the asset.
All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
15 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Machinery and equipment: 3-8 years
The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
An asset's carrying amount is written down imm ediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognized within "Other operating expenses" in the income statement.
Investm ent in associates
Com panies over which the Group has a significant but not controlling influence (2 0 -5 0 % of shares or votes) are classified as investment in associates and are accounted for using the equity method. This means that the investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the Group's share of the profit or loss of the associated company after the date of acquisition.
Leased assets
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risk of ownership is retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. The Group has no capital leases. Where the Group is a lessee, payments on operating lease agreements are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Associated costs, such as maintenance and insurance, are expensed as incurred.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the

receivables. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognized in the income statement within 'other operating expenses'. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 'other operating expenses' in the income statement.
Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill arises at the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over The North Alliance AS's interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree. Goodwill is not depreciated and is recognized in the statement of financial position at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circum stances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairm ent is recognized im m ediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
(b) T rad en am es
Separately acquired tradenames are recognized initially at cost. The purchase price of a separately acquired intangible asset incorporates assumptions about the probable economic future benefits that may be generated by the asset. Tradenam es acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Tradenam es are not depreciated and are recognized in the statement of financial position at cost less any accumulated impairm ent losses.
(c) R esearch and develo pm ent
Costs associated with developing or m aintaining computer software programs are recognized as an expense as incurred. Costs relating to development are capitalized and reported as intangible assets in the balance sheet if the following criteria are met in full:
- the product or process is clearly defined and its cost can be identified and measured reliably - the technical solution for the product has been demonstrated - the product or process will be sold or used in the company's operations - the asset will generate future economic benefit; and - sufficient technical, financial and other resources for com pleting the project are present
17 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
The directly attributable costs that are capitalized as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of the relevant overheads.
Amounts invested in product development are capitalized and depreciated under the straight line method over the expected useful life of the product.
(d) N o n-co ntractual custom er relationships
Non- contractual customer relationship represents intangible assets purchased through the effect of business combinations. Non- contractual relationships are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. They have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful lives.
(e) O rder backlog
Order backlog represents intangible assets purchased through the effect of business combinations. Order backlog relationships are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. They have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over the estimated useful lives.
Im pairm ent of non-financial assets
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circum stances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating units). Prior impairm ents of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.
Financial assets
Classification
The group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: At fair value through profit or loss, and loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
(a) Fin an cial a sse ts at fair v alu e through profit or loss.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorized as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are classified as non-current.
18 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets. The group's loans and receivables comprise "trade and other receivables" and "cash and cash equivalents" in the balance sheet.
Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade-date - the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' category are presented in the income statement within Other (losses)/gains - net' in the period in which they arise. Dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognized in the income statement as part of other income when the group's right to receive payments is established.
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. In the consolidated balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds. Where any group company purchases the company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the company's equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the company's equity holders.
Provisions
Provisions for restructuring costs and legal claim s are recognized when: the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be
19 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination payments. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of sim ilar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessm ents of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognized as interest expense.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost.
B orro w in g s
Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishm ent of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortized over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Em ployee benefits
Pension obligations
The Group has defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. After the contribution has been made the company has no further legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The contribution is recognized as personnel expenses.
When an employee has rendered service, the contribution payable to the defined contribution plan is recognized as a liability (accrued expense), after deducting contribution already paid. If the
20 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
contribution is due for service before the end of the reporting period, the excess is recognized as an asset (prepaid expense) to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.
Interest income
Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. When a loan and receivable is impaired, the group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loan and receivables is recognized using the original effective interest rate.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the company's shareholders is recognized as a liability in the group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the company's shareholders.
Contingent liabilities and assets
Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the financial statements. In those cases where the possible outflow of economic resources as a result of present obligations is considered improbable or remote, no liability is recognized. A contingent asset is not recognized in the financial statements but disclosed if it is probable that the benefit will flow to the Group.
Changes in accounting policies
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
The amendments to IAS 32 clarify the requirements relating to the offset of financial assets and financial liabilities. Specifically, the amendments clarify the meaning of "currently has legally enforceable right of set-off" and "sim ultaneous realization and settlement". The amendments have been applied retrospectively. As the Group does not have any financial assets and financial liabilities that qualify for offset, the application of the amendments has had no impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognized in the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amounts Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets
The amendment removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of cash-generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives had been allocated when there has been no impairment or reversal of impairment of the related CGU. Furthermore, the amendments introduce additional disclosure requirements applicable to when the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is measured at fair value less costs of disposal. These new disclosures include fair value hierarchy, key assum ptions and valuation techniques used which are in line with the disclosure required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurements. The application of these amendments has had no material impact on the disclosures in the Group's consolidated financial statements.
21 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
Amendment to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting
The amendment considers legislative changes to 'over-the-counter' derivatives and the establishm ent of central counterparties. Under IAS 39 novation of derivatives to central counterparties would result in discontinuance of hedge accounting. The amendment provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a hedging instrument meets specified criteria. The Group has applied the amendment and there has been no significant impact on the Group consolidated financial statements as a result.
IFRIC 21 Levies
The interpretation sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy if that liability is within the scope of IAS 37 'Provisions'. The interpretation addresses what the obligating event is that gives rise to pay a levy and when a liability should be recognized. The amendments have been applied retrospectively. The Group is not currently subjected to significant levies so the impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements is not material.
Standards, amendments and interpretations of existing standards that have not come into force and where the Group has not chosen early implementation
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2016, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
The standard addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but sim plifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortized cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&L. The basis of classification depends on the entity's business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instrum ents are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairm ent model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the ""hedged ratio"" to be the same as the one management actually use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9's full impact.
22 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The standard deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, tim ing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 'Revenue' and IAS 11 'Construction contracts' and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is permitted. The Group do not expect significant effect from IFRS 15.
IFRS 16 Leases
The standard deals with leases and will result in most of the Group's leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted. At this stage the Group does not intend to adopt the standard before its effective date. See note 13 for the Group's lease commitments.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group
There are no other standards or interpretations that are not yet effective that are expected to have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Significant m anagem ent ju d g m en t in applying accounting policies
When preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management undertakes a number of judgments, estimates and assum ptions about the recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustm ent to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Estimated impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
The Group tests for impairm ent of goodwill and other intangible assets as necessary, or at a minimum annually (note 5). The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is based on the valuein-use calculation. These calculations require the use of estim ates (note 5).
Revenue recognition Part of the revenue of the group is recognized based on a reference to stage of completion of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total service to be provided. This is mainly assessed based on hours booked on the project compared to estimated hours for completion.
23 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents

The majority of the recognized revenue each month is based on time and material contracts and therefore not based on management judgements.

All com panies are defined in five cash-generating units (CGU) used in the valuation of goodwill. Goodwill is evaluated b y m anagem ent per CGU and monitored b ase d on the perform ance of the CGUs. The recoverable am ount of each CGU is calculated b a se d on a value in use method.

The present value of the e xp ecte d cash flows of each segm ent w as determ ined using an average discount rate of 8,3 % , after tax. Th is is b ased on a risk free interest rate of 1 % , plus a risk premium and sm all b usiness premium totaling to 7,3 % in average. The risk premium is b ase d on observations of sim ilar com panies. The recoverable amount of each segm ent was determ ined based on the following estim ates: · Future sale s are estim ates based on budget and long term plans · Long-term average growth rate is se t at 2,1 % . ·Today's cost as a percentage of income is considered to reflect future projections · For goodwill testing, m anagem ent has used a 5 year period with a term inal value growth rate beyond th is period of 2,1% in average. Term inal growth rate is set pr CGU. · Risk-free interest rate is based on the 10-year government bond yield · Beta Value is based on figures from international com panies listed on the stock exchange
The intangible a sse ts are asse sse d that have an indefinite useful life due to the fact that th e y are not lim ited b y age, contracts, legal regulatory or any other factors.

Note 15 - Financial instrum ents

(Amounts in N O K 1.000)
F in a n c ia l risk The Group use s financial instruments su ch as bond loans. The purpose of these financial instruments is to raise capital for investments that are n e ce ssa ry for the Group's business. In addition, the Group has financial instruments su ch as accounts receivable, accounts payable, etc. which are directly related to its daily operations. For com m ercial hedging purposes, the Group uses derivatives. The Group does not apply hedge accounting. The Group does not use financial instruments, including derivatives, for revenue purposes. Procedures for risk m anagem ent are adopted by the Board. The main financial risks that the Group is exposed to are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, currency risk and credit risk. The Group's m anagem ent regularly evaluates these risks and estab lish es guidelines for how they are handled. The Group use s derivatives to hedge risks asso ciated with fluctuations in interest rates. In accordance with the Group's strategy for interest rate exposure, the Group uses derivatives to mitigate this risk.
C re d it risk The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk for trade and other receivables. The Group mitigates its exposure to credit risk by ensuring that all parties requiring credit, su ch as custom ers, are approved and subject to a credit check. The Group does not have significant credit risk asso ciated with a single counterparty or counterparties which can be viewed as a Group due to sim ilar credit risk. The Group has policies in place to ensure that sale s are made to custom ers who have not had significant problems with paym ent and the outstanding amount does not exceed the established credit limits.

M arket risk - in terest rate sensitivity The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its financial activities (see note 14). Part of the interest-bearing debt has floating rates, which m eans it is affected by changes in interest rates. The purpose of the Group's interest rate risk m anagem ent is to reduce interest c o sts and at the sam e time keep the volatility of future interest paym ents within acceptable limits.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the Group to potential interest rate changes.

Interest rate sensitivity 2016

Changes in interest rates in basis points + 50 -50 + 50 -50

-7 00 700 -7 00 700

Effect on equity (NOK 1 000)
-540 540 -540 540

Based on the financial instruments that existed per 31 December 2016, an increase of 0.5% would reduce the Group's profit before tax by TNOK 700 (2015: TNOK 700).

The average effective interest rate of financial instruments were as follows:

2016

2015

Bond loan

8,40%

8,40%

Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group's strategy for managing liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient liquid funds at all times to meet its financial obligations, both under normal and extraordinary circumstances, without risking unacceptable losses or damaging its reputation. The Group has large fluctuations related to restricted working capital due to seasonality and the timing of deliveries and payments.

Note 15 - Financial instrum ents cont.

M arket risk - fo reign cu rre n cy se n sitiv ity Exposures to currency exchange rates arise from the Group's overseas sales, which are primarily denom inated in SEK, DKK, USD and PLN. See note 2 "Segment information" for a split of the Group's revenue and trade receivables. The sales and trade receivables for each segm ent are in all m ateriality in local currencies.

Furthermore, the carrying amount of its net investm ents in foreign com panies fluctuates in Norwegian kroner com pared to the local relevant currencies. Profit after tax for the Group is also affected by changes in exchange rates, as the results of foreign com panies are translated into Norwegian kroner at the weighted average exchange rate for the period. The Group commercial hedges its foreign currency in the form of flexible forward contracts. Hedge accounting has not been applied. These contracts will take effect if the exchange rate fluctuates outside the strike rate and a maximum rate. The contracts are settled annually and if the contract goes over the period end, this is recognized in the financial statem ents at fair value. For 2016, these contracts amount to 0, and are therefore not recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statem ents.

D e term in atio n o f fa ir value The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts ap proxim ates fair value because these instruments have a short-term maturity date. Similarly, the carrying amount of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value as the impact of discounting is not significant. The fair value of capital leases is calculated as the present value of estim ated cash flows discounted at the interest rate applicable for the corresponding assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. The fa ir value h ierarch y The Group classifies fair value m easurem ents using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in m aking the m easurement. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active m arkets for identical asse ts or liabilities; - Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices); and
The following categories of financial instruments are measured at fair value as of 31 Decem ber 2016.

Capital managem ent policy and equity The main objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that the Group maintains strong credit ratings and thus affordable financing terms that are reasonable in relation to its activities. By ensuring a strong ratio between equity and debt, the Group will support the operational activities, thereby maximizing the value of its shares. The G roup manages its capital structure and m akes necessary changes to it based on a current assessm en t of the financial condition of the business and prospects in the short and medium term.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 - Accounting Principles
General information
The North Alliance AS is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Norway with offices at Kristian IV's gate 15 in Oslo.
B asis of preparation
The Financial Statements for The North Alliance AS ("the company") are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and required for the financial year beginning 1 January 2016 or later, as well as Norwegian disclosure requirements pursuant to the Accounting Act per 31 December 2016. The explanations of the accounting principles for the Group also apply to The North Alliance AS, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements in some cases cover The North Alliance AS . Ownership interests in subsidiaries are presented at cost.
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through equity or the statement of income.
The Financial Statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and events under sim ilar conditions.
The financial statements of the holding company The North Alliance AS cover all head office activities. Activities at head office include the Group's executive management and the corporate development, HR, accounting/finance, and risk management. The corporate function staff largely carries out assignm ents for the Group's other companies, and charges the com panies for these services. The Group Treasury acts as an internal bank and is responsible for the Group's external financing, management of the Group's liquid assets and overall management of the Group's currency and interest risks. Interest from the Group's internal bank and dividends and contributions to the Group from investments in subsidiaries are presented as finance items and specified in the income statement.
Classification
Assets and liabilities related to the normal operating cycle are classified as current assets and current liabilities. Receivables and liabilities not related to the normal operating cycle are classified as current if they are of a short-term nature, normally due within one year. Shares and other investments not intended for continued use or ownership are classified as current assets. Other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current.
Foreign currency
8 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported in the income statement in the lines Financial income and Financial expenses respectively.
Shares in subsidiaries
Shares are measured at cost and impairm ent loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The impairment is reversed if the basis for the write-down is no longer present. Group contributions received are included in financial income provided that the Group contribution received does not represent a repayment of capital invested. Group contributions that represent a repayment of capital invested are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of investments in subsidiaries. Net Group contributions payable (gross Group contributions less the associated tax effect) are included in the cost of investments in subsidiaries. Dividends from subsidiaries and associated companies are included in financial income.
Fixed assets
Fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation, amortization and impairment. Fixed assets with limited economic lives are depreciated over the expected economic life. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of net sales value and the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated. Impairment losses are reversed if the basis for the impairm ent is no longer present.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at fair value including allowance for bad debt.
Taxes
Income taxes are calculated from the profit (loss) before tax and comprise taxes payable and the change in deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in accordance with the liability method without discounting and provided for all differences between the carrying amount in the balance sheet and the tax base of assets and liabilities, and for unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is expected that the benefit can be utilized through sufficient taxable profits from expected future earnings.
Revenue recognition
Operating revenues are recognized when the services are rendered.
Interest income
Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. When a loan and receivable is impaired, the group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loan and receivables is recognized using the original effective interest rate.
9 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the company's shareholders is recognized as a liability in the group's financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the company's shareholders.
Contingent liabilities and assets
Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the financial statements. In those cases where the possible outflow of economic resources as a result of present obligations is considered improbable or remote, no liability is recognized. A contingent asset is not recognized in the financial statements but disclosed if it is probable that the benefit will flow to the Group.
Changes in accounting policies
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The amendments to IAS 32 clarify the requirements relating to the offset of financial assets and financial liabilities. Specifically, the amendments clarify the meaning of "currently has legally enforceable right of set-off" and "sim ultaneous realization and settlement". The amendments have been applied retrospectively. As the Group does not have any financial assets and financial liabilities that qualify for offset, the application of the amendments has had no impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognized in the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amounts Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets The amendment removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of cash-generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives had been allocated when there has been no impairment or reversal of impairment of the related CGU. Furthermore, the amendments introduce additional disclosure requirements applicable to when the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is measured at fair value less costs of disposal. These new disclosures include fair value hierarchy, key assum ptions and valuation techniques used which are in line with the disclosure required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurements. The applications of these amendments has had no material impact on the disclosures in the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting The amendment considers legislative changes to 'over-the-counter' derivatives and the establishm ent of central counterparties. Under IAS 39 novation of derivatives to central counterparties would result in discontinuance of hedge accounting. The amendment provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a hedging instrument meets specified criteria. The Group has applied the amendment and there has been no significant impact on the Group consolidated financial statements as a result.
IFRIC 21 Levies The interpretation sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy if that liability is within the
10 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
scope of IAS 37 'Provisions'. The interpretation addresses what the obligating event is that gives rise to pay a levy and when a liability should be recognized. The amendments have been applied retrospectively. The Group is not currently subjected to significant levies so the impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements is not material.
Standards, amendments and interpretations of existing standards that have not come into force and where the Group has not chosen early implementation: A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2016, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statement. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The standard addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but sim plifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortized cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&L. The basis of classification depends on the entity's business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instrum ents are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairm ent model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the ""hedged ratio"" to be the same as the one management actually use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9's full impact.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers The standard deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, tim ing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 'Revenue' and IAS 11 'Construction contracts' and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and earlier application is permitted. The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 15.
IFRS 16 Leases The standard deals with leases and will result in most of the Group's leases to be recognized on the
11 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
balance sheet. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted. At this stage the Group does not intend to adopt the standard before its effective date. There are no other IFRS standards or IFRIC interpretations that have not yet come into effect that are expected to have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group There are no other standards or interpretations that are not yet effective that are expected to have a significant impact on the Financial Statements.
12 The North Alliance

The North A lliance A S - 2016 Annual Financial Statem ents
Significant m anagem ent ju d g m en t in applying accounting policies When preparing the Financial Statements, management undertakes a number of judgments, estim ates and assum ptions about the recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and assum ptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. Estimated impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets The Group tests for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets as necessary, or at a minimum annually (note 5). The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is based on the valuein-use calculation. These calculations require the use of estimates (note 5).

To the General Meeting of The North Alliance AS
Independent Auditor's Report Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion We have audited the financial statements of The North Alliance AS. The financial statements comprise:
· The financial statements of the parent company, which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2016, and the income statement and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, and
· The financial statements of the group, which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2016 and consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion: · The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the law and regulations. · The accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the parent company as at 31 December 2016, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway. · The accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group as at 31 December 2016, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.
Basisfor Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilitiesfor the Audit o f the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company and the Group as required by laws and regulations, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Independent Auditor's Report - The North Alliance AS

Key Audit Matter

How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter

Carrying Value of Goodwill
(See note 5 in the annual report)
On the balance sheet date, the book value of of goodwill was NOK thousand 294 202 distributed between five different cash generating units (CGU's). No impairment charges related to these assets was recognised in the income statement.
We focused on the valuation of goodwill because the values involved are significant as the assumptions in the estimate involves management judgement.

We evaluated the appropriateness of management's identification of the Group's CGUs and the Group's controls over the impairment assessment process. Our procedures included challenging management on the suitability of the impairment model, the reasonableness of the assumptions and testing the mathematical accuracy of the model.
We assessed the reliability of management's forecast through a review of actual performance against previous forecasts. Further, we compared the future cash flows based on board approved long-term plans with expectations of future growth. We challenged management's expectations by comparing these expectations with historic results for the different CGU's.
We have benchmarked the Group's key market related assumptions with industiy comparators and with assumptions made in previous years. The discount rate's different components were compared to market information, and discussed with our valuation experts.
We validated the appropriateness of the related disclosures in note 5, including the sensitivities provided for the discount rate.
We found managements assumptions to be reasonable.

Revenue Recognition - Cut offProject Revenues
(See note 2 in the annual report)
The Group recognizes revenue from a material part of projects based on the stage of completion method.
This has been an area of focus during the audit based on the amount of revenue generated from these projects and due to the significant level ofjudgement required from management.

To satisfy ourselves about the reasonableness of management judgement related to cut off, our audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing the appropriateness of the Group's revenue recognition accounting policies, including those relating to stage of completion contracts and validating the compliance with the policies in terms of relevant accounting regulations.
Management prepared an evaluation of actual progress for all projects. We performed interviews with project managers to challenge management's assumptions of the progress of projects. We compared accrued cost with budgeted costs and assessed the level of completion based on experience with similar projects. We assessed the reliability of management's forecast through a review of actual results for completed projects. For projects with specific milestones, we compared the level of revenue recognition with these. For projects where deviations between budgeted and actual progress were identified we reviewed management's assessment for provisions.

Independent Auditor's Report - The North Alliance AS

Other information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Board of Directors' report, statements on Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Board ofDirectoi's and the Managing Directorfor the Financial Statements
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director (management) are responsible for the preparation in accordance with law and regulations, including fair presentation of the financial statements of the parent company in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, and for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements of the group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. The financial statements of the parent company use the going concern basis of accounting insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise will cease operations. The financial statements of the group use the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's Responsibilitiesfor the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Independent Auditor's Report - The North Alliance AS

· obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's or the Group's internal control.
· evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
· evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
· obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit
We also provide the Board of Directors with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
Opinion on the Board ofDirectors' report
Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Board of Directors' report and statements on Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption, and the proposal for the coverage of the loss is consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations.

Opinion on Registration and Documentation Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have considered necessary in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews ofHistorical Financial Information, it is our opinion that management has fulfilled its duty to produce a proper and clearly set out registration and documentation of the company's accounting information in accordance with the law and bookkeeping standards and practices generally accepted in Norway.
