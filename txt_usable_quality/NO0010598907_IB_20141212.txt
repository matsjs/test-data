NOTIFICATION TO BONDHOLDERS IN OLYMPIC SHIP AS
FRN Olympic Ship AS Senior Unsecured Bond Issue 2011/2015, ISIN NO 001 059890.7 FRN Olympic Ship AS Senior Unsecured Open Bond Issue 2012/2017, ISIN NO 001 065993.1 FRN Olympic Ship AS Senior Unsecured Callable Bond Issue 2014/2019, ISIN NO 001 071283.9 The board of directors and the shareholders of Olympic Ship AS have resolved to carry out a reorganization of the Olympic Ship group. The purpose of the reorganization is to "tidy up" the group structure and minimize the tax risks in the group under the Norwegian tonnage tax regime by transferring vessels and shares in different vessel owning companies of different offshore segments into separate holding companies and for certain of the vessels, to separate SPVs owned by such holding companies. As a part of the reorganization all of Olympic Ship AS1directly owned vessels and shares in vessel owning companies will be sold and transferred to sub-subsidiaries or companies wholly owned by them. The consideration payable by the involved companies will be based on EY valuations and will mostly be settled by share capital increase with conversion of debt before end of year 2014. Further, the limited partnerships Olympic NOR II KS, Olympic Subsea KS, Olympic Commander KS and Olympic Explorer III KS will all be converted to limited liability companies (AS). The conversion will take place with continuity for tax purposes ("skattemessig kontinuitet"), but will from a company law perspective imply a formal transfer of assets and liabilities to a new legal entity, and a subsequent solvent liquidation of the relevant limited partnerships. There is no uncalled capital in any of these limited partnerships. The reorganisation has been approved by the group's lenders, maintaining the financing currently in place in the group. As a part of the transfer of the financing for the vessels to the new ship owning SPVs, Olympic Ship AS will be required to grant guarantees ("selvskyldnergarantier") as security for the transferred loans, but will not incur any increased liability compared to what is already the case under the current financings. The new holding companies in the structure will also be required to grant similar guarantees for the financings of their respective subsidiaries.
