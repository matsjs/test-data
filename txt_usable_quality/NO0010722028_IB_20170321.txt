2 COUPON CLAIMS
The Issuer has from and including the Interest Payment Date 24 April 2016 not paid the scheduled interest payments and amortisations on the Senior Secured Bonds. Separate coupon claims have since then been established in relation to the scheduled Interest Payment Dates, and registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository ("VPS") as separate coupon claims ("Coupon Claims").
Allocations of PIK Bonds will be made to the registered holders of Senior Secured Bonds and Coupon Claims in VPS on the First Record Date with settlement two Business Days thereafter.
The Coupon Claims can be traded independent of the Senior Secured Bonds. However, the Coupon Claims do not have an ISIN and cannot be traded within the ordinary settlement system. Settlement of trades of the Senior Secured Bonds in VPS will by default not include the Coupon Claims unless it is manually transferred account-to-account. Any disputes with respect to distributions to the Coupon Claims need to be settled between the parties of the transaction assisted by the broker of the transaction.
The following Coupon Claims are registered in the VPS:
- Interest for the period from and including 24 January 2016 to, but excluding 24 April 2016, with ex coupon date 22 April 2016 (the "April 2016 Coupon Claim")
