a. The non-cancelled Bonds shall remain on the terms and conditions of the existing Loan Agreement, as amended. Accrued interest on the non-cancelled Bonds to, but not including June 1st 2009 will be paid on the first subsequent interest payment date according to the Loan Agreement.

b. The Bondholders consent to forego/give up 18 months of cash interest. The period of which interest shall forego shall commence June 1st 2009 and last to and including 30 November 2010. As this increases the value of the Bonds for SKDP and reduces the value for the Bondholders, the Bondholders shall be compensated by reducing the write-down according to (i) above by Bonds equal to USD 16,600,317.3. These Bonds will subsequently, in accordance with item. c. below directly, be converted to fully paid-up equity equalling 210,824,029 shares in SKDP (subject to adjustments for fractional entitlements).

If two or more Bondholders are distributed an equal share fraction the priority between them shall be settled by drawing of lots.

iii. Bondholders who are distributed fractional rights according to a pro rata distribution, but not allotted shares in accordance with (b) shall waive any right to fractional shares.

(ii) The Bondholders consent that neither the Proposal nor the amendments to the yard Construction Contracts shall constitute an Event of Default under the Loan Agreements, and Norsk Tillitsmann, as the Loan Trustee is given the power of attorney to make all necessary waivers and amendments to the Loan Agreements to implement the Proposal and reflect the amendments to the yard Construction Contracts.
