ISLAND OFFSHORE

Island Offshore Shipholding, L.P. (the "Company" or "Island Offshore") is the parent company in the Island Offshore group (the "Group"). At present the Group has 25 vessels in operation within the vessel segments PSV, AHTS, Well Stimulation (WS), Subsea Construction (SCV) and Light Well Intervention (LWI). Three vessels were sold in January/ February 2017 as part of the ongoing restructuring of the Group.
The fleet operates in Norway, Denmark, UK, Holland, India and Angola. The fleet is modern and versatile and Island Offshore has taken a leading position in attractive market segments. The Group is privately owned.

Main events:
Since the agreement with selected secured bank lenders and the subsequent amendments to the bond agreement in March 2016, the continued deterioration of the market conditions for owners and operators of offshore service vessels has required the Company to re-commence the discussions with its key stakeholders on the conditions for a further restructuring of the long term debt of the Group.

Negotiations have been conducted with the secured bank lenders having provided loans to finance the vessels owned by the Group, the suppliers having provided secured and unsecured loans to various members of the Group, certain bondholders in each of the two outstanding bond issues and the principal owners of the Company.

Subject to satisfaction of certain conditions precedent final and/or in principle agreements have been reached with the secured lenders for a restructuring period commencing June 30th, 2017 and ending December 31st, 2020 involving:

1.

Contribution of new cash equity from the existing owners

2.

Extension of maturities

3.

Amended amortization profiles

4.

Cash sweep provisions

5.

Amendments to covenant structures

6.

Additional measures

A majority of the bondholders in the two outstanding bond issues issued by the Company have indicated their support for the proposed restructuring.

Fleet
The fleet comprises 25 vessels including the Island Champion which is leased back on bareboat. In addition, the Island Patriot, which was sold in May 2016, is still operated by Island Offshore. Three vessels were divested in January/ February 2017 as part of the ongoing restructuring of the Group.
A total of 4 PSV vessels are currently in lay-up, following mobilization and re-entry to the spot market for the Island Clipper in August. Spot and term day rates for PSVs and AHTS have shown some improvement in recent months but overall continue to be low and unsustainable. We still expect the vessels currently in lay up to remain out of market until sustainable term work can be secured. The Group currently has 2 AHTS vessels in the spot market. Vessels are tendered for term work globally.

Quarterly Financial Report
- Comments

to ISLAND OFFSHORE

Income Statement
Fleet revenue totals NOK 495 mill in Q2-17, a significant improvement from NOK 259 million in Q1-17 which included a sales gain for Island Performer with NOK 55,6 mill, but somewhat lower than the same quarter last year (NOK 566 million in Q2-16). Fleet utilization in Q2-17 was 66% including vessels in lay-up, and improved from April following mobilization of 5 vessels for contracted work.
Revenue from the LWI vessels increased from NOK 10 mill in Q1-17 to NOK 254 mill in Q2-17 following mobilization of all vessels in April/May and high utilization through the quarter. AHTS revenue increased from NOK 15 mill in Q1-17 to NOK 33 mill in Q2-17. Spot market rates have improved in Q2-17 and alternative project work also contributes to improved earnings. SCV revenue and EBITDA also improved in Q2-17 due to mobilization and satisfactory utilization for two vessels previously in seasonal lay-up. PSVs on term charter report marginal but stable earnings.
EBITDA in Q2-17 totals NOK 199 mill versus NOK 60 mill in Q1-17. All vessel segments report positive EBITDA earnings in Q2 and YTD. YTD EBITDA includes a book gain of NOK 55,6 mill from the sale of Island Performer in January 2017.
Cost improvements provide important contributions to earnings, especially vessel lay-ups and associated crew reductions, but also continued salary reductions onshore and offshore, and improved maintenance efficiency. The measures will be continued in 2017 but market conditions must improve fundamentally to enable significant earnings improvement.
Q2-17 profit before tax is NOK 48 mill versus a loss of NOK -37 mill in Q1-17. Net Financial items in Q1-17 include a net financial income of NOK 56,1 mill related to buy back of ship mortgage at discount.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
Book value of fixed assets totals NOK 7,130 mill versus NOK 8,376 mill at 31.12.2016 following sale of 3 vessels in Q1-17. Additions in Q2-17 comprise planned maintenance activities related to class renewals and dry docking.
The cash balance is NOK 108 mill at 30.6.2017 thus down from NOK 142 mill 31.12.2016. The subsidiary Island Offshore VIII KS completed buy-back of a fleet loan in Q1-17, as part of the ongoing restructuring. The transaction was financed by calling of outstanding equity capital, repayment of loans following sale of two vessels and a new fleet loan. The subsidiary Island Offshore III KS completed an equity call in Q2-17 as part of the ongoing restructuring.
YTD cash flow is negative with NOK -35 mill due to reduced earnings from operations, buy-back of a loan and maintenance capex. Following sale of the three vessels in Q1-17, the Company repaid NOK 1,199 mill of financial loans and other long-term liabilities in addition to extraordinary repayment as part of the restructuring.

Net working capital is negative due to re-classification of outstanding ship mortgages to short term liabilities following the ongoing restructuring.
Net interest bearing debt (adjusted for CIRR loans/deposits and shareholder loans) has been significantly reduced from 31.12.2016 and totals NOK 5,742 mill at 30.6.2017 (down from NOK 6,987 mill at 31.12.16). This corresponds to a gearing ratio of 9,48 (NIBD/12M rolling EBITDA).
The Company is in breach with the current financial covenants, and has requested a waiver from the secured and unsecured lenders as part of restructuring negotiations.
The book value of the equity is NOK 1,683 mill up from NOK 1,632 mill 31.12.2016, which equals a book equity ratio of 20,3%, adjusted for CIRR loans/deposits. Following additional reduction in vessel broker values, VAE is estimated to NOK 1,837 mill at 30.6.2017, equal to a ratio of 21,8% based on broker's value appraisals of the fleet.

Financing and Other Financial Information
Due to the continued state of the market and the implications for cash flow, the Group initiated negotiations for a Standstill and Deferral Agreement with all secured creditors effective 22nd of November 2016. The Company has presented a holistic and comprehensive restructuring proposal to the secured lenders, which is still being evaluated by respective financial and legal advisors. Selective measures representing part of this proposal have already been implemented to facilitate and enable solutions for individual companies within the Group. To date the Group has not received formal waivers as requested from the lenders, to the contrary all the lenders have sent "Reservations of Rights" letters.

In addition easements of financial covenants for 2015, 2016 and 2017 was agreed.
As mentioned above, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions precedent final and/or in principle agreements have been reached with the secured lenders for a restructuring period commencing June 30th, 2017 and ending December 31st, 2020.

Going Concern

to ISLAND OFFSHORE

While the restructuring discussions are ongoing, the Company has decided to halt all payments of amortization to all of its finance providers.

The Going Concern assumption is based on the Company working with its finance providers to reach a sustainable solution for the Company. Consequently, the Q2-17 accounts reflect a situation where the Company is not liquidated and no forced sale of the vessels are carried out. While the Company remains confident that such a sustainable solution will be reached with the relevant stakeholders, there can be no assurance or guarantee that a solution will be reached.

During the discussions with the finance providers, the Company will continue to operate vessels normally in all other respects. In anticipation of reaching a sustainable solution with the finance providers, the liquidity position of the Company is expected to be stable but challenging in the period to come.

The Q2-17 accounts are not audited.

Market Outlook & Order Backlog
The overall market state has improved somewhat in Q2-17 with spot and term rates for AHTS and PSV vessels showing signs of improvement. Island Offshore has secured extensions for several vessels and across segments in Q2-17. Despite the recent improvements, we do not expect to see a more extensive market recovery until a more sustainable oil price is established, inducing increased E&P investment thus market activity. Short and long-term work across markets is still extremely competitive. Our view on the subsea and LWI market is maintained and we anticipate an earlier recovery for this market. Our chartering strategy remains firm with focus on securing long-term commitment with strategically preferred clients, in addition to exploring new business opportunities. The fleet order backlog excluding charterer's options totals NOK 2,2 billion at 30.6.2017. Contract coverage for the remainder of 2017 is 49%.

Health, Safety and the Environment

Island Offshore endeavors to promote and maintain a safe and healthy working environment offshore and onshore. This includes considering health and safety factors in the design, construction and operation of all vessels and equipment. We are committed to increasing the level of safety involvement and awareness among all employees. Key performance targets are set, validated and monitored in a QHSE plan. The personnel injury frequency remains low and competitive. Sick leave for offshore personnel has stabilized but the objective is still to reduce sick leave beyond current levels. CO2 emission from the fleet was reduced by 11% in the last 12 months, partly explained by lower vessel activity and lay-up. We continue with the main focus areas:
Reductions in emissions by use of alternative fuels, reduction in fuel consumption and cleaning of exhaust Selection and handling of chemicals Waste management Handling of environmentally harmful substances from marine and subsea operations
