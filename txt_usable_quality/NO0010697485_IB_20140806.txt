Dear Sir/Madam, After 15 years of serving Bluewater of which 14 years as Bluewater's Vice President of Finance & Administration, Kees Voormolen has decided to leave Bluewater and pursue his career elsewhere.

Joost is actively familiarizing himself with Bluewater's business and specifically with all matters surrounding the greater area of finance within Bluewater. Joost has held serious financial and management positions in a variety of industries, which will no doubt bring a fresh look at matters.
