To the bondholders in:
Viking Drilling ASA Second Priority Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012 with ISIN NO 001 040348.8 (the "NOK Tranche") and NO 001 040349.6 (the "USD Tranche")
Oslo, 26 May 2011
Partial and final repayment - Viking Drilling second lien bond issue due 2012
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NT") is appointed as loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the above mentioned bond issue (the "Loan") where Viking Drilling ASA is the issuer (the "Company").
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the loan agreement dated 17 December 2007 (the "Loan Agreement"), unless otherwise stated.
As previously announced the Company filed for US Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2008. After a considerably time under Chapter 11 it became obvious that there were no possibility for the Company to continue its operations, and the Company entered into the process of liquidation. As a part of the liquidation process most of the assets have now been sold. The assets were with few exceptions mortgaged to the creditors of the Company, primarily as security for the Company's first and second lien bond issues. The proceeds from the sale of assets will not be sufficient to cover the first lien bond issues, and there is thus no prospect that the sale will yield any payment to the second lien bondholders.
At the time the Company filed for Chapter 11 the Loan Trustee had a substantial part of the Loan amount as security on an escrow account. Following the Chapter 11 filing the amount on the escrow account, less estimated costs, was paid back to the bondholders.
As there is no prospect of any additional payment to the holders of the second bonds and to stop additional cost to accrue, the remaining amount will be used as a final payment to the bondholders.
