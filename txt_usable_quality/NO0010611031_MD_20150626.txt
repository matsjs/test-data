To the Bondholders in: ISIN NO 001 0611031 - 13.5 per cent Jasper Explorer PLC Senior Secured Bond Issue 2011/2016
Oslo, 26 June 2015
CANCELLATION - SETTLEMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS Reference is made to the information to Bondholders earlier today ("Settlement of distributions"). We have now been notified that certain costs that should have reduced the purchase price for the shares in Green Star Drilling Limited were not included in the calculation. Hence, the distributions will need to be adjusted. We will need to confirm the adjustments and will update on the new distributions and updated settlement date as soon as possible.
Yours sincerely Nordic Trustee ASA
