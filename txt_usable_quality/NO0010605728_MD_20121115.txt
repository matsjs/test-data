 Fully underwritten rights issue of approximately SEK 700 million
The Board o f D irectors o f PA Resources AB (publ) ("PA Resources" or the "Com pany") has resolved to offer convertible bondholders of the Com pany early conversion to n ew shares, subject to approval from an extraordinary general m eetin g . The Board of Directors also proposes the extraordinary general m eeting to authorize the Board of D ire c to rs to re so lv e upon a s u b s e q u e n t fu lly u n d e rw ritte n rig h ts issue in an a m o u n t o f approxim ately SEK 700 m illion.

Too high indebtedness given current production
 The Azurite field in the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) has during the past two years performed far below expectations, which has considerably weakened the Company's financial position and flexibility in relation to the plan presented in 2010.
 As a consequence of the failure in the Azurite field/Mer Profonde Sud, the Board of Directors has resolved to write down the asset together with the Marine XlV-license, which has been returned, with a total of SEK 1,495 million.
 In the Company's view, the current production rate is too low to balance the current indebtedness. The imminent refinancing risk has brought great insecurity regarding the Company's ability to develop its assets, and has had a negative impact on the pricing of the Company's shares, convertible bonds and outstanding bond loans.
 Shareholders' equity amounted to SEK 956 million as per 30 September 2012 and was thereby lower than the specified minimum level of equity pursuant to terms and conditions for the outstanding bond loans, of SEK 2 billion. Furthermore, equity in relation to capital employed was below the specified minimum level of 40 percent. The proposed transactions will, assuming full acceptance, increase equity to more than SEK 2.5 billion and equity in relation to capital employed to more than 40 percent. The lenders have been informed and discussions have been initiated to obtain a so called waiver during the period prior to the completion of the proposed transactions.
S et-off of convertible bond loan and a subsequent rights issue
 The Board of Directors of PA Resources has resolved upon a new issue of shares to the holders of the Company's convertible bond 2008/2014, subject to approval from an extraordinary general meeting which is planned to be held on 7 December 2012. The subscription price is set at SEK 0.15 per new share meaning each convertible bond entitles the holder to subscribe for 116 new shares through set-off of an amount of SEK 17.40 per convertible bond, corresponding to the nominal value of the convertible bond plus accrued interest as per 6 November 2012 (the "Offer"). The total nominal value of the convertible bonds, including accrued interest as per 6 November 2012, amounts to SEK 1,072 million.

PRESS RELEASE 7 NOVEMBER 2012

 Several large convertible bondholders, whose holdings in aggregate correspond to more than 40 percent of the outstanding convertible bonds, have expressed their support for the proposed transactions and have stated their intention to participate in the Offer.
 The Offer is subject to the underwriting agreement entered into between the Company and Carnegie Investment Bank AB ("Carnegie") (the "Underwriting Agreement") not being terminated, which can be effected, inter alia, should the Offer not reach an acceptance level exceeding 90 percent of the total nominal amount of the convertible bonds.
 The Board of Directors of PA Resources has also proposed that the extraordinary general meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to resolve upon a subsequent rights issue in an amount of shares of approximately SEK 700 million at a subscription price of SEK 0.10 per new share (the "Rights Issue"). The Rights Issue is conditional upon the completion of the Offer.
 The right to subscribe for new shares in the Rights Issue will be distributed by approximately 50 percent to the current shareholders in the Company and the remaining approximately 50 percent to shareholders who have obtained shares through set-off of convertible bonds in the Offer.
 The Rights Issue is fully underwritten by a underwriting consortium, in which Gunvor Group participates with SEK 200 million.
Flexibility and continued ability to develop prioritized assets
 The Offer and the Rights Issue (together the "Transactions") will, assuming full acceptance after transaction related costs, in total increase equity by approximately SEK 1,576 million, while reducing net debt by approximately SEK 1,500 million.1
 The Company's estimated cash flow in combination with the proceeds from the Rights Issue enables planned maintenance investments in producing fields in the following years. The Company also anticipates that its balance sheet, in combination with debt financing, will support planned amortizations of the outstanding bond loans of, in aggregate, approximately SEK 950 million during 2013.
 The strengthened financial position is also expected to visualize and secure asset values by strengthening the Company's position in negotiations regarding various asset related transactions.

PRESS RELEASE 7 NOVEMBER 2012

Background and m otives
Substantial asset portfolio and positive cash flow from producing fields
PA Resources has a substantial asset portfolio of producing fields, fields under development, and assets which the Company has not yet begun developing. In addition, the Company has a number of assets with great exploration potential. The current production is generating a positive operating cash flow, and during the third quarter of 2012 the average production amounted to 7,700 barrels of oil per day.
The production rates and the operating cash flow have improved substantially since the Aseng field was brought into production in late 2011. The field has produced above plan and the development investments have been recovered already during the second quarter of 2012. The Company is currently planning for additional development and exploration projects in connection to the producing Aseng field.
Lower production from the Azurite field than expected
In 2010, PA Resources presented a plan aiming to increase the producing assets from 32 million barrels of oil equivalents in 2010 to 50 million barrels of oil equivalents in 2014. This plan was to a large extent based on a successful development of the Azurite field in the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville). During the past two years it has however become evident that the significant investment that was made by PA Resources in the field have generated a considerably lower return than anticipated - the actual production from Azurite during 2012 turned out to be almost 10,000 barrels per day lower than the plan presented in 2010. The Company has on two previous occasions revised the field's reserves downwards which resulted in a write-down of SEK 1,436 million during the fourth quarter of 2011. The total cash flow since 2010 has been more than SEK 2.9 billion below the plan, and the total investments in the field will most likely not be recovered. The low production rates have also provided less favorable credit terms and higher costs. Consequently, the Company has been forced to accelerate the amortization of the credit facilities linked to the asset, which has significantly weakened the Company's financial position and flexibility.
The annual review of the Company's asset values, which has been moved forward, results in a required impariment of SEK 1,495 million, as per 30 September 2012. The Azurite field/ Mer Profonde Sud is written down by SEK 1,321 million, and in addition the Marine XIV license in the Republic of Congo has been returned at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2012 resulting in a required write-down of SEK 174 million, which is also reported as per 30 September 2012.
Weakened financial position and reduced flexibility
As described above, the disappointment in the Azurite field has resulted in the current production rate, in the Company's view, being too low to balance the current indebtedness. The associated refinancing risk has brought great insecurity regarding the Company's ability to develop its assets and has had a negative impact on the pricing of the Company's shares, convertible bonds and outstanding bond loans. The weakened financial position in relation to the plan has also led to difficulties for the Company to, at reasonable values, dispose assets or enter into so called farm-out agreements, which is an important part of the Company's business model.
In the light of the above, it is the view of the Board of Directors that PA Resources has come to a situation where the Company is required to take actions to substantially reduce debt in relation to the assets and cash flow, and also to provide additional liquidity to the Company. If the Transactions are not carried out, the Company is of the opinion that a formal restructuring process will be required.
Two-step transaction that substantially strengthens the Company's financial position
The Transactions, as proposed by the Board of Directors, mean that convertible bondholders are offered to set-off their convertible bonds against newly issued shares in PA Resources, after which the Company carries out a fully underwritten rights issue of shares in an amount of approximately SEK 700 million. The right to subscribe for shares in the Rights Issue will be distributed by approximately 50 percent to the current shareholders in the Company and the remaining approximately 50 percent to shareholders who have obtained shares in the Offer.

PRESS RELEASE 7 NOVEMBER 2012

Assuming full acceptance in the Offer and full subscription in the Rights Issue, the Company's net indebtedness will be reduced from approximately SEK 3,410 million to SEK 1,910 million, while equity will increase from approximately SEK 956 million to SEK 2,532 million.2
Financial position following the proposed Transactions enabling the business plan The Company's financial position will be significantly strengthened through the Transactions. The Company's cash flow in combination with the proceeds from the Rights Issue enables planned maintenance investments in producing fields in the following years. The Company also anticipates that its balance sheet, in combination with debt financing, will support planned amortizations of the outstanding bond loans of, in aggregate, approximately SEK 950 million during 2013.
The Company also anticipates that it, with continued use of alternative refinancing solutions and a sustained net indebtedness in line with the level following the Transactions, will be able to use the cash flow from producing fields to continue the development of the prioritized assets. The prioritized development projects currently include the Danish discoveries Broder Tuck and Lille John in the license 12/06, the Elyssa and Zarat fields in the Zarat license in Tunisia, and Block I with the Aseng field in Equatorial Guinea. In addition, selective and limited exploration activities will be carried out.
In order to adapt the size of future investments to the Company's financial position following the Transactions and to diversify the Company's exposure to single projects, the Company intends to actively continue to reduce its interest in certain of the prioritized assets, through so called farm-outs. The Company is currently involved in several discussions regarding such transactions and the Company is of the opinion that the Transactions will improve the potential to finalize those discussions.
Given the Company's assumptions regarding future farm-outs, the investments to develop prioritized assets of approximately 30 million barrels of oil to producing reserves and to continue selective exploration activities are estimated to approximately SEK 1.8 billion during the period 2013-2018, which results in a development cost of approximately USD 9 per barrel. Given the Company's assumptions on production during the period 2013-2018, the Company is estimated to hold a net cash position by the end of 2018 of approximately SEK 600 million.
According to PA Resources the value of the Company's assets, given the prevailing plan, amounts to approximately SEK 8.5 billion, of which SEK 2.3 billion comprises producing fields and SEK 3.9 billion prioritized development assets. The remaining SEK 2.3 billion represent the Company's exploration assets.3
Altogether the Management and Board of Directors are of the opinion that the Company has an attractive underlying asset base that is currently burdened by an excessive indebtedness. The proposed Transactions will create a strong basis for long-term production growth and value creation.
The O ffer to th e convertible bondholders
 Set-off of claims according to the convertible bonds is made against newly issued B-shares in PA Resources. In order to administratively enable the Rights Issue to be distributed to existing shareholders and to the convertible bondholders who have subscribed for shares through the Offer, the Board of Directors proposes that the upcoming extraordinary general meeting resolves upon a registration of a new series of shares, B-shares, after which the Company's existing shares become A-shares. Following completion of the Transactions, the B-shares will automatically be converted to A-shares.
 Holders of the Company's convertible bond 2008/2014 are offered to set-off each convertible bond, with a nominal value including accrued interest as of 6 November 2012 of SEK 17.40, against 116 newly issued B-shares in PA Resources at a subscription price of SEK 0.15 per new share.
2 Based on a pro forma balance sheet as per 30 September 2012. For more information see "Un-audited pro forma report effects of the Offer and the Rights Issue" 3The valuation is based upon independent reserve reports conducted by third parties, an oil price of 110 USD/barrel, an USD/SEK exchange rate of 6.53 and a discount factor of 10%.

PRESS RELEASE 7 NOVEMBER 2012

 The maximum of new B-shares issued upon full acceptance level in the Offer amounts to 7,144,496,260, corresponding to approximately 92 percent of the share capital in PA Resources before the Rights Issue.
 The Offer is conditional upon:
1. The Underwriting Agreement entered into between the Company and Carnegie not being terminated by Carnegie. Carnegie has, inter alia, the right to terminate the Underwriting Agreement should the Offer not be accepted to the extent that more than 90 percent of the claim according to the convertible bond 2008/2014 (including accrued interest as of 6 November 2012) is used as payment through set-off against new B-shares, or in case the required waivers are not given in relation to non-fulfilled terms and conditions relating to the Company's outstanding bond loans.
2. That the shareholders in PA Resources on the upcoming extraordinary general meeting make the required decisions to issue new shares in connection with the Offer.
PA Resources reserves the right to withdraw the Offer in the event that any of the above conditions will not be fulfilled.
The Rights Issue
 The Rights Issue amounts to approximately SEK 700 million. Existing shareholders are entitled to subscribe for approximately 50 percent and those who have obtained B-shares through the Offer are entitled to subscribe for the remaining approximately 50 percent. The subscription price is set at SEK 0.10 per new share.
 The final number of shares that each A- and B-share will entitle to subscribe for will be announced in connection with the Offer being completed and the outcome thereof being announced.
 The Rights Issue is fully underwritten by a underwriting consortium, in which Gunvor Group participates with SEK 200 million.
 The Rights Issue is conditional upon the completion of the Offer.
Underw riting com m itm ents
Several large convertible bondholders, whose holdings in aggregate correspond to more than 40 percent of all convertible bonds outstanding, have expressed their support for the proposed Transactions and have stated their intention to participate in the Offer.
The Rights Issue is underwritten in its entirety by a consortium of Swedish and international investors, many of which have previously invested in securities issued by the Company. The single largest underwriter is Gunvor Group having committed to underwrite an amount of SEK 200 million. The underwriting commitments are subject to certain conditions, including that the Underwriting Agreement between the Company and Carnegie not has been terminated.
In case the guarantors are required to subscribe for shares pursuant to their undertakings, certain of them previously having invested in the Company's corporate bonds, have a right to pay for such shares by set-off of part of their bond holdings. Of the total underwriting commitments, approximately SEK 120 million may be honored by set-off of the Company's Swedish bonds and approximately SEK 50 million may be honored by set-off of the Company's Norwegian bonds.
The part of the Rights Issue that is not underwritten by the consortium is underwritten by Carnegie in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Underwriting Agreement it has entered into with the Company. Carnegie has, inter alia, the right to terminate the Underwriting Agreement should the Offer not be accepted to the extent that more than 90 percent of the claim according the convertible bond 2008/2014 (including accrued interest as of 6 November 2012), through set-off, is used for payment for new B-shares, or in case the required waivers are not given in relation to non-fulfilled terms and conditions relating to the Company's outstanding bond loans.
