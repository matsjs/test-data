Nordic Trustee ASA (formerly known as Norsk Tillitsmann ASA) ("NT") is appointed as Loan Trustee for the above mentioned bond issue (the "Loan") where Oceanlink Ltd. (the "Borrower") is the issuer. The terms and conditions of the Loan are set out in the bond agreement between the Borrower and NT (on behalf o f the Bondholders) dated 28 June 2007, as later amended 30 June 2010 (the "Bond Agreement").

Background
According to Clause 10 of the Bond Agreement, the maturity price of the bonds shall be calculated according to Clause 10.5. Clause 10.5 further specifies that a committee shall finally set and approve NAV, which is the key input in the calculation of the maturity price. The Committee comprising three members, of which Ketil Arvesen was nominated by the Borrower, Hans Bernhard Lind was nominated by the Loan Trustee and the chairman, Halvor Grov (of Advokatfirmaet Selmer) was agreed to be nominated by the parties.
Ernst & Yong, as independent consultant, was commissioned to conduct a valuation o f the enterprise to estimate NAV, and the Committee has subsequently finally set NAV.
Maturity price
The Committee has set NAV to zero, and the Bonds will mature at price zero. According to the Bond Agreement, the Bonds shall not accrue interest. Hence, the Bonds will mature 1 July 2014 at price zero and no further payments will be made to the Bondholders.

Yours sincerely Nordic Trustee ASA
