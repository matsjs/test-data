PROPOSED

RESTRUCTURING OF BOND LOANS

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the bond issues with ISIN NO 001 053847.3 and ISIN NO 001 060599.1 (the "Bond Loans") with Blom ASA ("Blom" or the "Issuer") as Borrower.

All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Amended and Restated Bond Agreement dated 11 November 2011, or the summons to this Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise stated.

The information regarding the operational andfinancial status o f the Issuer and market conditions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever to such information.

1.

BACKGROUND

As announced by the Issuer in the stock exchange notices on 27 February 2012, 29 February 2012 and 9 March 2012, the Issuer has for some time been in dialogue with a majority of its bondholders regarding a process to strengthen the capital structure of the Issuer by increasing the equity ratio.

The Issuer has now approached the Bond Trustee and requested the Bond Trustee to call for a Bondholders' Meeting in both the Bond Loans to vote over a proposed restructuring.

A majority of the bondholders, including Folketrygdfondet and other large bondholders, who in total controls 63.5% of Blom's NOK 300 million bond loan, have been part of the discussions and are prepared to vote for the Proposal in the bondholders meeting.

2.

THE PROPOSED RESTRUCTURING

The Issuer proposes (i) that the 2009 Bond Issue is converted into shares in the Issuer including the Exchange Offer (see section 2.1), (ii) that the Issuer is permitted to obtain additional short term financing (see section 2.2) and (iii) that certain amendments are made to the terms of the 2011 Bond Issue (see section 2.3) (the "Proposal").

NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
2 .1 Conversion of the 2009 Bond Issue
The Issuer proposes that all outstanding bonds in the 2009 Bond Issue (the "2009 Bonds") are converted into shares in the Issuer (the "Consideration Shares").
The Bondholders in the 2009 Bond Issue will prior to the bondholders' meeting be offered the right to exchange their bonds in the 2009 Bond Issue for bonds (the "Convertible Bonds") in a new subordinated convertible bond issue (the "Convertible Bond Issue") on the terms and subject to the limitations set out in 2,1.2 below (the "Exchange Offer"). If the Proposal is approved, all 2009 Bonds that have not been acquired by the Issuer through the Exchange Offer will be converted into shares in the Issuer on the terms described in 2.1.1 below.
2.1.1 Conversion into shares of the 2009 Bond Issue
The conversion of 2009 Bonds into shares in the Issuer will be carried out at a conversion price of NOK 10 per share (the "Conversion Price"). The Conversation Price assumes, and is subject to, a consolidation of the Issuer's shares prior to the conversion, whereby 100 existing shares of par value NOK 0.10 will be consolidated into one new share of par value NOK 10. The Conversion Price is therefore effectively equal to the current par value of the Issuer's shares of NOK 0.10. Please refer to the Issuer's notice of an extraordinary general meeting to be held on 25 April 2012 (the "EGM"), available at www.blomasa.com and www.newsweb.no, for the proposals to be considered at the EGM.
It is also proposed that interest on the 2009 Bond Issue will accrue up to and including (but not after) 24 April 2012, and that all accrued interest will also be part of the conversion. This means that the total amount to be converted will be minimum NOK 306,125,040 and maximum NOK 346,125,040 assuming a conversion of the entire 2009 Bond Issue.
The Consideration Shares will be issued to the Bondholders upon the conversion of the 2009 Bonds through a share capital increase to be considered at the EGM.
2. 1.2 The Exchange Offer
As an alternative to converting their bonds into shares, the Issuer offers the bondholders to exchange their 2009 Bonds for bonds in the Convertible Bond Issue. The exchange ratio between the two loans will be 100:31, which means that the subscribers will receive, for every 100lh transferred 2009 Bond, 31 bonds in the Convertible Bond. The Convertible Bond will be a subordinated loan with priority after the Company's ordinary obligations.
The Exchange Offer is subject to a maximum principal amount of NOK 40 million. The maximum size of the new loan will therefore be NOK 12,400,000. If 2009 Bonds with a principal value in excess of NOK 40 million are tendered in the Offer, the number of 2009 Bonds exchanged through the Exchange Offer will be rounded down in proportion to the number of 2009 Bonds tendered by each tendering Bondholder.
The Exchange Offer is conditional upon the EGM approving the Restructuring Resolutions described in 2.4 below,
The offer period for the Exchange Offer commences on 10 April 2012 and expires at 5 p.m. CET on 19 April 2012. Bondholders who wish to accept the Exchange Offer must return the enclosed Acceptance Form (Appendix 1) by no later than 5 p.m, CET on 19 April 2012 to:

By signing and returning an Acceptance Form, the tendering Bondholder will authorize ABG Sundal Collier Norge ASA to transfer the tendered 2009 Bonds from the VPS account of the tendering Bondholder to a client VPS account in the name of ABG Sundal Collier Norge ASA.
The Convertible Bond Issue will have a five year term, but can only be converted to shares up until 30 April 2014. The Convertible Bond Issue will have an interest rate of 2% p.a. Accrued interest will be added to the principal of the loan in arrears every quarter. The term sheet for the Convertible Bond Issue is attached to the summons as Appendix 2 (the "Convertible Bond Term Sheet").
By signing and returning an Acceptance Form, the tendering Bondholder will irrevocably authorize the Bond Trustee to subscribe for the Convertible Bonds on their behalf.
The Bond Agreement for the Convertible Bond Issue will be entered into by the Issuer and the Bond Trustee acting as the bondholders' representative. The Bond Agreement shall regulate the bondholders' rights and obligations with respect to the Convertible Bonds. If any discrepancy should occur between Convertible Bond Term Sheet and the Bond Agreement, then the Bond Agreement shall prevail. Each tendering Bondholder is deemed to have granted authority to the Bond Trustee to finalize the Bond Agreement. Minor adjustments to the structure described in the Convertible Bond Term Sheet may occur, the provisions in the Bond Agreement will be substantially consistent with those set forth in the Convertible Bond Term Sheet and not less favourable for Bondholders in any material respect. The Acceptance Form specifically authorizes the Bond Trustee to execute and deliver the Bond Agreement on behalf of the prospective bondholders. On this basis, the Issuer and the Bond Trustee will execute and deliver the Bond Agreement and the latter's execution and delivery is on behalf of all of the tendering Bondholders, with the effect that they will become bound by the Bond Agreement. The Bond Agreement specifies that all Convertible Bond transfers shall be subject to the terms thereof, and the Trustee and all Convertible Bond transferees shall, when acquiring the Convertible Bonds, be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Bond Agreement, which specifies that all such transferees shall automatically become bound by the Bond Agreement upon the completed transfer having been registered in the VPS, without any further action required to be taken or formalities to be complied with, The Bond Agreement shall specify that it shall be made available to the general public for inspection purposes and may, until redemption in full of the Convertible Bonds, be obtained on request by the Trustee or the Issuer, and such availability shall be recorded in the VPS particulars relating to the Convertible Bonds.
2 .2 Additional financing
In the future financing of Blom the Issuer thinks the flexibility to issue new bonds or other forms of short term financing is important. In order to secure such financing, the Issuer may issue new bonds or seek other forms of short term financing during 2012 in the amount of a maximum of NOK 30 million with a term of no more than 9 months (the "Intermediate Financing"). It is proposed that the Intermediate Financing will rank ahead of the 2011 Bond Issue. If such financing is secured through a new bond issue, the Bondholders in the 2011 Bond Issue will have a preferential right to subscribe for bonds in such bond issue.

2.3 Amendments to the 2011 Bond Issue

(ii) The Margin shall be changed from 11% p.a. to 5.5% p.a. (iii) The existing Intercreditor Agreement shall terminate upon conversion of the 2009 Bonds. (iv) The Share Pledges and Guarantees provided under the 2009 Bond Issue, which currently serve

(v) The guarantee (NW: Selvskyldnerkausjon) in the amount of EUR 5,000,000 furnished by Blom CGR S.p.A. shall be released. (vi) The bank account pledge in bank account no 9750.01.01818 shall be released. (vii) The Issuer shall be allowed to incur additional indebtedness in the aggregate amount of NOK 30 million in the form of the Intermediate Financing (through the issue of new bonds, bank loans or other financing) and the negative pledge and financial indebtedness provisions in the Bond Agreement will be amended accordingly.
(viii) The Bond Trustee is authorized to enter into an intercreditor agreement (the "New Intercreditor Agreement") with the Issuer (on behalf of the bondholders in each of the 2011 Bond Issue and the New Bond Issue), in form and content reasonably acceptable to the Bond Trustee, to include, inter alia, provisions on (i) full subordination for the Bond Issue, both in terms of payment and priority, save for the payment of ordinary interest as long as no Event of Default under the 2011 Bond Issue has occurred, and (ii) no enforcement rights under the 2011 Bond Issue while the New Bond Issue is outstanding.
The cash sweep limit of NOK 70 million will remain unchanged.
2 .4 Conditions The Proposal including the Exchange Offer is subject to the EGM passing the following resolutions (the "Restructuring Resolutions"): (i) to consolidate the shares of the Issuer on a 100:1 basis; (ii) to reduce the Issuer's share capital by NOK 24 191 484 by way of a reduction of the par value
of the shares from NOK 10 to NOK 0.50; (iii) to increase the Issuer's share capital by up to NOK 17,306,252 through the issuance of up to

Regulatory issues:
In accordance with the Norwegian Securities Trading Act, the Manager must categorize all new customers in one of three customer categories; Eligible counterparties, Professional and Non-professional clients. For further information about the categorization the Applicant may contact the Manager. As the Manager is not in the position to determine whether the application for Placement Bonds is suitable for the Applicant, the Manager will treat the application as an execution-only instruction from the Applicant to apply for Placement Bonds in the Private Placement. Hence, the Applicant will not benefit from the corresponding protection of the relevant conduct of business rules in accordance with the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.
The Manager is a securities firm, offering a broad range of investment services. In order to ensure that assignments undertaken in the Manager's corporate finance department is kept confidential, such Manager's other activities, including analysis and stock/bond broking, are separated from its corporate finance department by a "Chinese wall". The Applicant acknowledges that the Manager's analysis and stock- or bond broking activity may act in conflict with the Applicant's interests with regard to transactions relating to Bonds as a consequence of such Chinese wall.
