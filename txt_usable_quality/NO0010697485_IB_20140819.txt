To the bondholders in:
ISIN: NO 001 069748.5 -10 % Bluewater Holding B.V. Senior Unsecured Bond Issue 2013/2019 Oslo, 19 August 2014
Information from Bluewater Holding B.V. Nordic Trustee ASA has been approached by Bluewater Holding B.V. and asked to publish the below information on www.stamdata.no on their behalf:
Dear All, I herewith inform you that, as a result of differing expectations, Joost Vulto has - after mutual consultation - left the Bluewater organization. I regret that after only a very short time in position as VP Finance & Administration, we had to conclude to this, but I am convinced that on both the short and longer term it is the best decision for Bluewater. In the interval the responsibilities of the VP Finance & Administration will be shared between Frank Harte (Manager Financial Reporting & Analysis) and Paul Neijzen (Group Financial Controller), basically following their existing roles. The search for a suitable VP Finance & Administration has been re-started. Should you have any questions related to this matter, please direct these to your contacts at our Floofddorp office. Kind regards,
Hugo Heerema President and CEO
Yours sincerely Nordic Trustee ASA
