The need for a refinancing

STERLING RESOURCES

 Sterling has been exploring a range of options to either refinance the business with third party debt (possibly combined with equity or equity-linked finance), sell all or part of Breagh, sell the UK subsidiary or merge the parent company, for the past 2 years
 Against the backdrop of falling gas prices and a very weak industry environment, exacerbated by the prolonged uncertainty regarding the ownership of Dea UK under RWE and LetterOne, the refinancing and M&A processes have not been successful
 SRUK had been due to repay its senior secured bonds and associated liabilities, currently estimated at ca. USD 208m(1), by 31 March 2016 (postponed from 29 February 2016), however, following the implementation of the recapitalization a significant portion of the outstanding bond debt is expected to be swapped for equity in SRL
 The sum required to repay the bonds is in excess of the current estimated net present value of its interest in the Breagh field (which provides materially all of the asset value of Sterling) at recent forward curve prices, plus existing cash(2)
 Although SRL had an equity market cap of ca. USD 11m on the day prior to the announcement of the Recapitalization, this likely reflects an expectation of some recapitalisation with bondholders, an M&A transaction and/or a material recovery in gas prices
 The company has therefore negotiated a consensual financial restructuring with its Bondholders involving a large scale debt-for-equity swap and the provision of a new standby credit facility, which should provide the company with sufficient funding for all foreseeable needs over the next 2-3 years

(1) $180m principal, $13.5m redemption premium, $8.4m accrued interest since 30 October 2015, $6m additional amendment fees payable if no redemption by 29 February.
(2) NPV calculated at 10% discount rate using technical and economic assumptions set out in news release of 11 March 2016

Simplified key steps in the proposed recapitalization

STERLING RESOURCES

 A Rights Offering will be launched for an amount equal to the difference between (i) SRUK's bond liabilities at the time of completion (expected to be ca. USD213m) and (ii) remaining bond principal of USD40m (potentially slightly more than USD40m, subject to USD/CAD movements during the period the Rights Offering is open)

 The number of shares to be offered is ca. 14.3 billion, which is designed to be 97% of the total share capital that would be issued and outstanding post completion of the rights offering. This leads to a subscription price of ca. USD 1.2 cents or CAD 1.6 cents per share

 The proceeds of any subscriptions from existing shareholders would reduce the outstanding bond liability on a $ for $ basis (after any adjustment for USD/CAD movements during the period the Rights Offering is open)

 In the likely event that all the rights are not taken up, the Bond Trustee, for and on behalf of the bondholders, will subscribe for the remaining common shares of SRL offered under the Rights Offering at the same subscription price

 SRL will transfer the share capital of SRUK to a new UK company, also 100% owned by SRL (for flexibility in security arrangements and any future debt refinancing)

 SRUK will enter into the Amended and Restated Bond Agreement No. 4 (effectively restating bonds to a value of $40m and amending terms as summarised hereafter)

 SRUK will enter into the Super Senior Loan Facility Agreement (as summarised hereafter) with two of the Bondholders

STERLING RESOURCES

 The Bond Trustee has hitherto granted various waivers and amendments in relation to these obligations to avoid any event of default under the terms of the Bond Agreement
 Discussions have taken place between the Parent, the Issuer and a group of large Bondholders holding in aggregate a majority of Bonds (the "Bondholder Committee") in relation to a recapitalisation of the Group
 On 11 March 2016 a bondholder summons was issued with the pre-agreed support from Bondholders holding over 76 percent of Bonds to vote in favour of the recapitalization at a Bondholder Meeting to be held on 18 March
 The SSCF is fully committed and credit approved on the basis of agreed detailed term sheets, from two Bondholders
 The recapitalization is expected to complete in mid May 2016
 A share consolidation is planned shortly afterwards, to be approved separately at a general meeting of shareholders

Breagh: current technical case and capex

 Sterling has updated its 2P production and capital expenditure (capex) profile since the RPS Mid-2015 Breagh Report, to reflect cash timing of expenditures, revised well and compression costs, and revised well and compression timings
 Key assumptions:
- RPS Mid-2015 assumed 12 wells plus 2 hydraulic stimulations of existing wells; batch drilling programme starting in December 2015, onshore compression online October 2017
- Sterling's current technical case now assumes 10 wells plus 1 hydraulic stimulation of an existing well; sequential drilling programme starting in April 2017, all new wells fracked following drilling, onshore compression online October 2018
- Net pre-sanction costs for Phase 2 through to the first quarter of 2017 are expected by Sterling to amount to US$3.1 million. - The following table shows Sterling's expectation of Breagh capex on a cash basis, all net to Sterling's 30 percent interest. Cumulative
remaining net capex from the start of 2016 through to the first quarter of 2019 is US$51.5 million. Production profile shown on page 13.

Breagh: decommissioning costs and provisioning

STERLING RESOURCES

 Sterling's current estimate of decommissioning costs for the Breagh Phase 1 facilities (assuming wells A9 and A10 drilled) is $38 million (Sterling 30% share) in 2015 real terms, based on a third party report assuming 10 wells
 This represents a 18% percent decrease in the previous estimate prepared in late 2014 which is largely due to lower marine support costs
 Breagh decommissioning provision amount and timing is driven by terms of the Decommissioning Security Agreement (DSA):
- A provision is required when NPV of future field cash flows (excluding the decommissioning cost) falls to below 1.5x NPV of decommissioning cost (this date is the Trigger Date), using a designated third party's pricing assumptions
- The discount rate is 3-month GBP LIBOR (currently ca. 0.7%) - If the Trigger Date is determined to be in the following year, a pre-tax cash provision is required to be made in February of the following
year equal to (X*Y) - Z - F, where:
X = NPV of net decommissioning cost; Y = a risk factor of 1.4 (initial run-down period ratio) or 1.1 (later run-down period ratio); Z = NPV of future net field cash flows (excluding decommissioning cost); and F = any existing provision
- The cash provision is to be placed into trust with an agreed professional trust corporation (certain alternatives apply including a suitable Letter of Credit)
 Sterling estimates that the Trigger Date is expected to occur in approximately 2022

Important notes

STERLING RESOURCES

Production, Reserves and Resources
 Current production rates disclosed herein may not be indicative of long term performance or ultimate recovery. Such rates are not determinative of the future production rates of the relevant fields and do not reflect how the production from such fields will decline thereafter.
 Estimates of Reserves and Future Net Revenue have been made assuming the development of each property in respect of which the estimate is made will occur, without regard to the likely availability to the Company of funding required for that development.
 Possible Reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than Probable Reserves.
 Company Reserves totals are arithmetic aggregations of multiple estimates, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading as to volumes that may actually be recovered.
Readers should give particular attention to the estimates of individual classes of Reserves and appreciate the differing probabilities of recovery associated with each class under a specific set of economic conditions: A 90 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimated Proved Reserves (1P); A 50 percent probability thatthe quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sumof the estimated Proved plus Probable Reserves (2P); and A 10 percent probability thatthe quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sumof the estimated Proved plus Probable plusPossible Reserves (3P).
 The estimates of Reserves and Future Net Revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of Reserves and Future Net Revenue for all properties, due to the effects of aggregation.
 Contingent Resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies. Contingencies may include factors such as economic, legal, environmental, political and regulatory matters or a lack of markets. It is also appropriate to classify as contingent resources the estimated discovered recoverable quantities associated with a project in the early evaluation stage. There is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.
 The P(50) or 2C Contingent Resources quantity is considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be recovered. If probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a 50 percent probability P(50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate.
 Prospective resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an associated chance of discovery and a chance of development. There is no certainty that any portion of the resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.
 In relation to the relative uncertainty of recoverability of resources, a Best Estimate resources quantity is considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. There should be at least a 50 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.
 MMboe numbers may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf : 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the volume ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.
