BACKGROUND AND CORPORATE UPDATE

Since September 2009 the Company has continued to experience weak shipping

markets. Furthermore, the Company has been negatively impacted by restructuring costs

in the ship management division, and weaker than expected results for the ship supply

division, primarily in Spain. Recently the Company also experienced an incident where

a vessel operated by the Company's ship management division experienced over

pressurization of its cargo tanks during loading. As a result the Company decided to

write-down goodwill related to the ship management division prior to the publication of

the Q4 accounts for 2009. M AILIN G ADD RESS · P .O .B O X I4 7 O V IK A , N -O Il6 OSLO

As a consequence of the weaker than expected financial performance and the write down of goodwill, the Company is currently in breach with its bond loans covenants related to the gearing ratio and the absolute level of equity. The Company remains confident about its long term business plan, however, the preliminary earnings outlook for 2010 indicates that the existing instalment and maturity obligations, with both bonds and seller credits due ultimo 2010, will need to be amended.
As a result of the abovementioned situation the Board of Directors has initiated a process to investigate financial alternatives for the Company to meet its credit obligations.
The Company and its advisers will perform a thorough analysis of the Company's financial situation and prospects. As the Company has a desentralized and diversified global operation, both in terms of customers and geography, the Company and the advisors will need a minimum of 3 weeks to collect data and analyze the situation and establish a preliminary view of potential alternative remedies. This analysis will form the basis for subsequent discussions with relevant stakeholders, with the aim to jointly develop a solid and viable financial platform for the Company. The Company has appointed Carnegie ASA as its financial adviser.

EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL

3.1 The Company's evaluation

The Company is of the view that a temporary waiver will facilitate the process for concluding the financial plan, while reducing the risk of unnecessary uncertainty. The Company has not been able to identify any adverse implications of the Proposal for the Bondholders. In the Company's opinion, the Proposal should hence be fully aligned with the interests of the Bondholders. The Proposal will allow the Company the opportunity to focus on creating the necessary basis for discussions of a robust financial solution, which is vital to the safeguarding of the interests of all of its stakeholders, including the Bondholders.

3.2 NTM's evaluation
NTM puts forward the Proposal without any further evaluations or recommendation from the NTM. NTM has requested the Borrower to offer the Bondholders an interest compensation equal to default interest until the breach of covenants has been remedied. The Company has decided not to offer such compensation, but has provided an explanation to NTM which the Company deem as reasonable, which can be disclosed to individual bondholders that are willing to become insiders.

The Bondholders must independently evaluate, based on available information, whether the Proposal is acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from tax and other advisors regarding the effects and possible consequences of the Proposal.

Please find attached as Exhibit 1 a bondholder's form (the "Bondholder's Form") from the Securities Depository ("VPS"), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' meeting. If the Bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered as owner in VPS - the custodian must confirm (i) the ownership of the Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered.
Each Bondholder may authorize NTM to vote on its behalf, in which case the completed Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorizing NTM to vote, must for this purpose be returned to NTM in due time before the scheduled date of the Bondholders' meeting. The Bondholder's Form may be sent in copy by e-mail, facsimile or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details.
In the event any Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was issued, the new owner must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy (as the case may be) evidence which, in the reasonable opinion of NTM, is sufficient to establish the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy (other than to NTM), to notify NTM by telephone or by email (at set out in the first page of this letter) by 16:00 hours (4.00 p.m.) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
Yours faithfully, Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
