Company Communication related to National Parks
In reference with IntraFish article released today, we can say that: a) All our current operational licenses are within an existing National Park b) Our current business plan is not impacted by the new National Park c) The new National park resolution, north of our current operational area, includes only the land, not the surrounding waters.
Best regards
Nicos Nicolaides CEO Nova Austral S.A
