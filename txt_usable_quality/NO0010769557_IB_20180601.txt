INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDER OF NOR OFFSHORE SPV, LTD.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Nor Offshore SPV, Ltd. (the "Company") which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in shareholder's equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2017 and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the Cayman Islands, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
1

 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company's shareholder, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Emphasis of Matter
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which indicates that the Company incurred a consolidated net loss of $35,689,032 during the year ended 31 December 2017. As a result the Company's liabilities exceed its assets at the year end by an amount of $178,547,729. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern in future periods is dependent upon future income from operations, or failing that, the support of bondholders in providing future financing. Management, in conjunction with the service providers engaged by the Company, are making all possible efforts to market the remaining vessel for sale or bareboat charter. In the absence of future contracts, the operations of the Company for future periods will be dependent upon the willingness of the bondholders to continue to finance the Company. These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

NOR OFFSHORE SPV, LTD. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2017 (with comparatives for the period from 4 May 2016 (commencement of operations) to 31 December 2016) Expressed in U.S. Dollars

The Company's registered office is located at the offices of Conyers Trust Company (Cayman) Limited, Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands.

("Da Vinci SPV"), an exempted company incorporated and existing under the laws of Cayman Islands with registration number 312510 (collectively referred to as the "Subsidiaries").

The Company incurred a consolidated net loss of $35,689,032 during the year ended 31 December 2017 (period ended 31 December 2016: net loss of $142,858,697). As a result, the Company's liabilities exceed its assets at the year end by the an amount of $178,547,729. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern in future periods is dependent upon future income from operations, or failing that, the support of bondholders in providing future financing. Management, in conjunction with the service providers engaged by the Company, are making all possible efforts to market the remaining vessel for sale or bareboat charter.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The significant accounting policies adopted by the Company are as follows:
(a) Basis of consolidation and preparation
The Company is the sole shareholder of the Subsidiaries. The financial position and comprehensive income of the Subsidiaries have been consolidated herein.
The functional and presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements is the United States dollar and not the local currency of the Cayman Islands reflecting the fact that the Company's participating shares are denominated in United States dollars.
These consolidated financial statements are prepared on a fair value basis for financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Other financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities are stated at historical cost or redemption amount.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
(b) Standards issued but not yet effective
Standards and amendments to existing standards effective 1 January 2017
There are no standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2017 that have had a material impact on the Company.
New and amended standards and interpretations effective 1 January 2018:
IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments This standard addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortized cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&L. The basis of classification depends on the entity's business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI with no recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities, there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in a company's own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the `hedged ratio' to be the same as the one management actually uses for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact this will have on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers This standard deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18, 'Revenue' and IAS 11, 'Construction contracts' and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact this will have on the consolidated financial statements.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

(b) Standards issued but not yet effective (continued)

New and amended standards and interpretations effective 1 January 2018 (continued):

IFRS 16 - Leases This standard was issued in January 2016. For lessees, it will result in almost all leases being recognized on the statement of financial position, as the distinction between operating and finance leases will be removed. Under the new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognized. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. The accounting for lessors will not significantly change. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact this will have on the consolidated financial statements.

At the date of authorization of the consolidated financial statements there were a number of other Standards and Interpretations which were in issue but not yet effective. Management anticipates that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

(c) Use of estimates The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosures made in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities in the future.

(d) Foreign currency translation Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Translation differences on financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.

(e) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Company in the management of its short-term commitments.

(f) Fixed Assets Fixed assets are valued at purchase price including the expenses incidental thereto. Fixed assets are depreciated over their estimated useful economic lives, taking into account their scrap value. The depreciation rates and methods applied are as follows:

Fixed asset Vessels and equipment

Rate of depreciation 4.00% per annum

Depreciation method Straight-line over 25 years

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
(f) Fixed Assets (continued)
Impairment on vessels and equipment The Company assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment on the fixed assets on a regular basis. Fixed assets are tested for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Where the management considers that a fixed asset has suffered a permanent depreciation in value at any time, an additional write-down is recorded in order to reflect this loss. For the year ended 31 December 2017, a permanent impairment of the fixed assets was recorded at US$Nil (period ended 31 December 2016: $122,404,486).
Disposal of vessels and equipment On disposal of an item of fixed assets, the difference between the disposal proceeds and its carrying amount is recognized in comprehensive income within gain on sale of fixed assets. During the year, it was elected to sell Nor Atlantis. The sale was executed in terms of a sale agreement dated 20 November 2017 with a sale price of US$60,540,001. A gain on sale of fixed assets of US$4,284,786 was earned upon the finalization of the sale agreement.
(g) Financial liabilities
(i) Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified at initial recognition as financial liabilities at amortised cost.
All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of financial liabilities at amortised cost, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company's financial liabilities include accrued expenses and other payables and bonds payable.
(ii) Subsequent measurement The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:
Bonds payable This is the category most relevant to the Company. After initial recognition, bonds payable are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the effective interest rate amortization process.
(iii) Derecognition A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
(h) Operating expenses Expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis and are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
(i) Interest expenses Interest expense is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on an effective interest rate method basis for all debt instruments on an accrual basis.
3. CASH
The Company's cash mainly comprise of cash deposits with DNB Bank and Fidelity Bank. The Fidelity Bank account bears prevailing bank interest. The DNB Bank account does not bear interest.
4. FIXED ASSETS
Fixed assets comprise of the sea vessels "Nor Atlantis" and "Nor Da Vinci", Marshall Islands flagged diving support vessels owned by Atlantis SPV and Da Vinci SPV, respectively. Both vessels were acquired by the Subsidiaries on 10 May 2016.
The depreciation is based on the assumed remaining useful life of the ship on acquisition of 25 years with US$Nil scrap value.
