NORDIC TRUSTEE

To the Bondholders in:
ISIN: SE0010740530 - Cibus Nordic Real Estate AB (publ) (the "Issuer") up to EUR 135,000,000 senior unsecured floating rate bonds (the "Bonds")

Stockholm, 26 April 2018

Notice of waiver of Terms and Conditions
Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) is the appointed agent (the "Agent") under the terms and conditions for the Bonds dated 1 March 2018 (the "Terms and Conditions").
This notice is distributed to the Bondholders in accordance with Clause 18(c) o f the Terms and Conditions.
The Issuer has requested that the Agent consents and agree to a waiver o f Clause 10.1(a)(ii) (Information to the Bondholders) so that the Issuer may make the quarterly interim unaudited consolidated report o f the Group available to the Bondholders within two months following the period ending on 30 June 2018, instead o f the period ending on 31 March 2018.
The waiver is made for the purpose to rectify an obvious mistake considering:
(i) the short period passed between the Issue Date (5 March 2018) and 31 March 2018 and that it was never the intention that such report was to be released by the Issuer considering that the Issuer acquired all its assets in early March 2018;
(ii) that the Maintenance Test according to Clause 11.2 (Testing o f the Maintenance Test) o f the Terms and Conditions is tested for the first time on 30 June 2018 and the intention was to align the first reporting date and the first covenant testing date; and
(iii) that the first reporting for the Issuer's listed shares will be made on 30 June 2018 and it is the Issuer's intention to align the reporting under the Bonds with the reporting under the Issuer's shares.
Our waiver is made in accordance with Clause 18(a)(i) (Amendments and Waivers) o f the Terms and Conditions.
The above waiver has become effective as of 26 April 2018.
This notice will also be sent by regular mail to the Bondholders in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.

Kind regards, Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ)
