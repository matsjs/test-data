Holders of DDM Treasury Sweden AB's (publ) (the "Issuer") senior secured fixed rate notes 2013/2016 with ISIN SE0005280831 (the "Notes") have approved the Issuer's proposal to amend the terms and conditions of the Notes.
CorpNordic Sweden AB (the "Agent"), acting in its capacity as Agent for the noteholders under the terms and conditions of the Notes, initiated on 22 January 2014 a written procedure in which the noteholders could approve or reject a request made by the Issuer. The request involved an extension of the geographical scope in which the proceeds from the Notes may be used to include Republic of Croatia, the Republic of Slovenia, the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro and Hungary.
The written procedure was closed on 17 February 2014. Noteholders representing 46% of the total outstanding nominal amount participated in the procedure and 100% of the nominal amount for which noteholders voted in the procedure approved the Issuer's request. This means that the request was adopted.
The amendments have taken effect on 18 February 2014. A consolidated version of the terms and conditions of the Notes including the amendments can be downloaded here.
A formal notice of the outcome in the written procedure has been sent by ordinary mail to direct registered noteholders and registered authorised nominees in accordance with the terms and conditions of the notes. For further information please contact Jolande Svensson-Klijn or the issuer.
