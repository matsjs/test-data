Profit forecast

The following is included in Neste Oil's financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014:

Developments in the global economy have been reflected in the oil, renewable fuel, and renewable feedstock markets; and volatility in these markets is expected to continue.

Global oil demand is anticipated to continue increasing, but growth estimates are generally slightly below 1 million barrels per day for 2015. The forward reference refining margin is currently reasonably strong. However, the refining capacity growth of more than 1 million barrels per day in Asia and the Middle East is expected to create some pressure on global product supply demand balance particularly during the second half of the year. Transatlantic supply demand balance is also dependent on the planned and unplanned refinery shutdowns. Gasoline margins are currently supported by contango buying, and the coming driving season typically supports gasoline market in the spring. Middle distillate imports from Russia, the Middle East, and the United States are expected to remain on a high level also in 2015.

Vegetable oil price differentials are expected to vary, depending on crop outlooks, weather phenomena, and variations in demand for different feedstocks, but no fundamental changes in the drivers influencing long-term average feedstock price differentials are expected. Feedstock prices have been on a downward trend, but vegetable oil price differentials have remained narrower than the historical average. Market volatility in feedstock and oil prices is expected to continue, which will have an impact on the Renewable Products segment's profitability.

In 2015, the Neste Oil group's investments are expected to total approximately EUR 450 million, including approximately EUR 100 million for a major turnaround at the Porvoo refinery. The Porvoo turnaround is scheduled to start in April 2015 and is expected to last for approximately 8 weeks. Product inventory of approximately EUR 200 million is planned to be built in anticipation of the turnaround. The turnaround is expected to have an approximately EUR 70 million negative impact on Oil Products segment's

Section B - Issuer comparable operating profit.

Disclosure

Crude oil price changes, supply and demand balances, together with uncertainties related to political decision-making on biofuel mandates, the U.S. Blender's Tax Credit and other incentives will be reflected in the oil and renewable fuel markets.

Based on the above, Neste Oil expects the Neste Oil group's full-year 2015 comparable operating profit to be robust, although probably lower than reached in 2014.

The above statements include forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees o ffuture financial performance and Neste Oil's actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result o f many factors. Neste Oil cautions prospective investors not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as at the date o f this Prospectus.

Risks Relating to Macroeconomic Conditions
The disruptions and volatility in the global markets may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.
During the last few years, the uncertain global economic and financial market conditions have had an adverse effect on general business conditions, increased unemployment and lowered business and consumer confidence. Despite the measures taken by various governmental and regulatory authorities as well as central banks around the world, the economic recovery has been slow and the economic situation has remained unstable. The general economic and financial market conditions in Europe and other parts of the world have repeatedly undergone significant turmoil due to, among other factors, the on-going sovereign debt issues in certain European countries, particularly certain eurozone member countries including Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. However, except for Greece, the conditions in these countries have improved recently, but there can be no assurance that the financial crisis will not re-emerge in the future.
The events described above have also significantly impacted the global oil market. The potential consequences of the international financial and economic crisis on virtually all business organisations are significant and complex and may include, to one degree or another, among others, materially lower earnings, inability to obtain necessary credit, inability to satisfy covenant and other obligations in debt and other arrangements, inability to meet financial obligations and inability to retain key staff members.
In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as seen between Russia and Ukraine, could impose trade restrictions to one or more of Neste Oil's markets, which could impair the operating result of Neste Oil. For example, trade sanctions or similar actions against Russia could have an adverse impact on Neste Oil's access to Russian feedstocks. Furthermore, oil prices are subject to, among others, regional unrest, such as supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty.
The market uncertainties and geopolitical tensions in oil-producing countries have continued in 2014 and 2015 and this uncertainty has resulted in turbulence on the oil market and swings in crude and feedstock prices. Oil prices declined by over USD 50 per barrel during 2014, which demonstrates the unpredictable nature of oil markets as this development in oil prices was not expected at the beginning of 2014. It is inherently difficult to make accurate predictions as to when the oil markets will start to stabilise, as the oil markets are impacted by macro movements of the financial markets and many other factors, including the stock, bond and derivatives markets, over which Neste Oil has no control.
Neste Oil's revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014 totalled EUR 15,011 million, a decrease of EUR 2,227 million, or 12.9 per cent., as compared to EUR 17,238 million for the year ended 31 December 2013. This decline yearon-year mainly resulted from lower overall market prices, which had an impact of approximately EUR 1.2 billion, lower trading activity, and lower sales volume in Oil Products. Neste Oil's operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2014 was EUR 150 million, a decrease of EUR 482 million, or 76.3 per cent., as compared to EUR 632 million for the year ended 31 December 2013. The decrease was primarily due to inventory losses totalling EUR 492 million. Neste Oil's profit for the year ended 31 December 2014 was EUR 60 million, a decrease of EUR 464 million, or 88.5 per cent., as compared to EUR 524 million for the year ended 31 December 2013. Neste Oil group's net cash from operating activities for the year ended 31 December 2014 totalled EUR 248 million, a decrease of EUR 591 million, or 70.4 per cent., as compared to EUR 839 million for the year ended 31 December 2013. The year-on-year difference was mainly attributable to the effect of declining oil price to the IFRS operating profit and cash flow. There can be no assurance that turbulence on the oil market and swings in crude and feedstock prices would not have negative impacts on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
14

Neste Oil has experienced in the past, is currently experiencing and expects to experience in the future, the negative impact of periods of economic slowdown or recession, political uncertainty and declines in the demand for crude oil and oil products in the oil markets in which it operates. The economic situation in the countries in which Neste Oil operates has been adversely affected by the general weakening in economic conditions and the continuing turmoil in the global financial markets. Such countries have, among others, experienced declining economic growth. Negative economic developments of the kind described above have affected and may continue to affect Neste Oil's business in a number of ways, including, among others, the income, wealth, liquidity, business and/or financial condition of Neste Oil's customers.

Variations in macroeconomic factors, including difficulties in individual countries' ability to meet their financial obligations, and oil market fluctuations as well as potential further adverse developments in macroeconomic conditions, particularly in countries in which Neste Oil operates, may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.

Risks Relating to the Business of Neste Oil

Risks relating to oil and renewablefu el refining and marketing may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.

The oil refining industry, regardless of the feedstock used, by its nature, exposes Neste Oil to market, counterparty, contractual and operational risks, as well as to other risks, including health, safety and environment risks, IT and security risks and general political and regulatory risks. In particular, risks related to legislation, technology and intellectual property rights, as well as feedstock supply, are likely to be of greater emphasis in the renewable fuels business compared to traditional oil refining. Any one of the above risks, either singly or in the aggregate, may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.

Changes in refining margins in the refining industry may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.

The financial results of Neste Oil are primarily affected by the price differential, or margin, between refined petroleum and renewable product prices and the prices for crude oil, different vegetable oils and other feedstocks used for refining petroleum and renewable products. The cost for Neste Oil to acquire its feedstocks and the price at which it can ultimately sell its refined petroleum and renewable products depend upon a variety of factors largely beyond the control of Neste Oil. Historically, refining margins have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be so in the future. Future volatility in refining margins may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.

Factors that may affect Neste Oil's refining margins include:

·

changes in aggregate demand and supply for crude oil, different vegetable oils, other renewable feedstocks and

refined petroleum products;

·

changes in demand and supply for specific crude oils, specific vegetable oils and other feedstocks as well as

specific refined petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel as well as specific renewable products, such as

NEXBTL diesel;

·

fluctuations in the prices for crude oil, vegetable oils, other fossil and renewable feedstocks as well as refined

petroleum and renewable products;

·

evolution of worldwide refining capacity and, in particular, refining capacity that relates to the petroleum and

renewable products refined by Neste Oil;

·

pricing and other actions taken by Neste Oil's competitors that impact the market;

·

availability of price arbitrage for refined petroleum and renewable products between different geographical

markets;

·

changes in the cost and availability of logistics services for feedstocks and for refined petroleum and renewable

products;

·

environmental or other regulations, which could require Neste Oil to make substantial expenditures without

necessarily increasing the capacity or operating efficiency of its refineries;

15

changes in the costs related to alternative ways of fulfilling regulated bio-mandates;

·

changes in the mandatory petroleum product specifications of the EU and governmental authorities for refined

petroleum products such as the EU Fuel Quality Directive;

·

changes in the EU's Renewable Energy Directive, EU member state legislations and U.S. legislation; and

·

general political and economic conditions.

Depending on the nature of each factor and the particular circumstances, these factors may have either a short-term or long-term material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.

Increases in global conventional refining and conversion capacity relative to growth in demand fo r the refined petroleum products may have a material adverse effecton Neste Oil.

In recent years, the increase in conventional refining capacity has exceeded growth in demand, placing refiners in a situation in which excess capacity puts pressure on refining margins. This situation has been exacerbated by financial instability in certain countries and areas, with high or fluctuating oil prices together with uncertain economic conditions leading to declining demand for certain oil products, particularly in OECD countries. However, with the adoption of higher environmental standards in the EU and the United States, many of Neste Oil's competitors have been upgrading the conversion and desulphurisation capacity of their plants, which has resulted in their refined petroleum product slate and quality becoming more similar to that of Neste Oil and, consequently, increase competition faced by Neste Oil's refined petroleum products. Further increases in global refining and conversion capacity relative to demand for refined petroleum products may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.

Significant or extended changes in demand and supplyfundamentals fo r crude oil, vegetable oils and otherfeedstocks and fo r refined petroleum and renewable products may have a material impact on market prices fo r crude oil, vegetable oils and other feedstocks, as well as refined petroleum and renewable products, which, in particular if affecting the pricing o f traffic fuels in Europe and in the United States, may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.

The market prices for crude oil, vegetable oils and other feedstocks, as well as refined petroleum and renewable products, are subject to significant fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors affecting demand and supply, which are outside the control of Neste Oil. Although the demand for crude oil and refined petroleum products during the period of 2013 2014 contributed to moderate refining margins, it is impossible to accurately predict future demand and supply trends and their impact on crude oil, vegetable oils and refined petroleum and renewable product prices. Significant pricing level changes during the period between the purchase of crude oil, vegetable oils and other feedstocks and the sale of refined petroleum and renewable products, in particular if affecting the pricing of traffic fuels in Europe and in the United States, may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.

Generally, there is an approximately one-month lag time from the delivery of crude oil, vegetable oils and other feedstocks to the refineries to the time when the refined petroleum and renewable products from these feedstocks are produced by Neste Oil. Neste Oil also maintains inventories of crude oil, vegetable oils and other feedstocks and of refined petroleum and renewable products, and the values of such inventories are subject to fluctuations in market prices. Neste Oil's refinery inventory consists of two components. The first and largest component remains relatively constant over time and is referred to as the `base inventory'. The second and daily fluctuating component is the amount of inventories differing from the base inventory level and at Neste Oil it is called `transaction position'. The base inventory is the minimum level of stocks with which can reasonably be assured that the refineries can be kept in operation and the deliveries are not compromised. It comprises inventories at the refineries and within supply chain. The base inventory includes the minimum level of stocks that Neste Oil is required to maintain under Finnish laws and regulations. The base inventory creates a risk in Neste Oil's income statement and balance sheet inasmuch as Neste Oil applies the "first in first out" (FIFO) method for measuring the cost of goods sold, raw materials and inventories. Any significant or extended change in supply and demand trends may have a material impact on prices for crude oil, vegetable oils and other feedstocks as well as refined petroleum and renewable products and may also result in inventory losses which may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.

Increasing domestic and international competition may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.

Neste Oil faces domestic and international competition in the markets in which it operates. In particular, competition in oil retailing around the Baltic remained intense throughout 2014. Diesel fuel increased its share of the market, as heavy

16

traffic usage did not decrease as much as other areas. Also with the adoption of higher environmental standards in the EU and the United States and the historically relatively healthy refining margin levels a few years ago, many of Neste Oil's competitors have been upgrading their refining facilities, which increases the competition faced by Neste Oil in the market for its particular slate of refined petroleum products. Increasing amounts of exports from Russian ports of particularly middle distillates of higher quality has increased competition in the region, among others. Increasing competition may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Failure to protect Neste Oil's proprietary technology may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil and impair its growth opportunities.
Neste Oil is actively pursuing growth opportunities using its proprietary technology and know-how. Its technology may provide an ability to capture additional margins in selected special product markets through developing new businesses in higher margin products such as renewable fuels and other high quality renewable components. To protect its rights, Neste Oil maintains numerous patents worldwide. Neste Oil also relies on a combination of international trade secret and other intellectual property laws and protective measures to establish and protect its proprietary rights in certain of its products, systems and services. The measures taken by Neste Oil to protect its technology and know-how against third party infringement and appropriation may prove inadequate as there can be no assurance that its proprietary rights will be upheld as valid or that its competitors will not develop competing technology that will not infringe Neste Oil's proprietary rights. Commercialisation of Neste Oil's proprietary technology may also give rise to claims to the effect that its technology infringes upon the proprietary rights of other parties. Also, as competitors continue to develop competing technologies, one or more of Neste Oil's proprietary technologies could become outdated. Should Neste Oil fail to develop, defend or protect its technology, products, systems and services, it may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
An interruption to production at Neste Oil's refineries and plants would reduce its production, which may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.
Neste Oil's business is dependent to a significant extent on its wholly-owned fossil fuel refineries at Porvoo and Naantali, Finland, and its renewable diesel refineries in Singapore and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In addition, Neste Oil has interests in two joint venture companies, Bahrain Lube Base Oil Company B.S.C and Nynas AB. Neste Oil owns 45 per cent. of a base oil plant in Bahrain and 49.99 per cent. of Nynas AB's refineries. The Porvoo refinery is Neste Oil's principal production facility. The annual crude refining capacity of the Porvoo refinery is approximately 9.8 million tonnes per annum (206,000 barrels per day) and total production capacity approximately 13.0 million tonnes per annum. The Naantali refinery focuses on speciality petroleum products, such as bitumen and solvents, and has an annual distillation capacity of approximately three million tonnes per annum (58,000 barrels per day). In addition, Neste Oil operates NEXBTL renewable diesel refineries with total production capacity of approximately two million tonnes per annum. Neste Oil's operations would be subject to significant interruption if one or several of these refineries were to experience a major accident or otherwise be forced to shut down or curtail production due to unforeseen events lasting for a period of several weeks, such as extended power outages, industrial accidents or IT problems.
Neste Oil's conventional oil refineries are scheduled to have a major maintenance turnaround every five to six years. The Porvoo refinery's next maintenance shutdown is scheduled for the spring of 2015 and it is expected to last for approximately eight weeks. Naantali refinery's six-week maintenance shutdown was completed in May 2012.
The scheduled and any unexpected shutdowns will have an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Problems or delays in accessing raw materials at competitive prices could have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.
Neste Oil requires crude oil, vegetable oils and other feedstocks in order for its refineries to produce various refined petroleum and renewable products. Unlike certain of its competitors that have their own oil exploration and production operations, Neste Oil is dependent, for a substantial portion of its operations, on continued access to these and other raw materials and supplies at appropriate prices. Problems or delays in accessing lower cost, heavier and more sour crude oil or lower cost vegetable oils and other renewable feedstocks could increase the cost of obtaining raw materials and have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. The majority of Neste Oil's fossil feedstocks are purchased from Russia. Neste Oil's access to Russian crude oil and other feedstocks might be interrupted as a result of, among other things, limited pipeline capacity, structural changes in the Russian oil industry, government restrictions, economic and trade sanctions, taxation, regional unrest or problems in transporting sufficient quantities of oil through Primorsk and other harbours on the Baltic Sea or by rail to Neste Oil's refineries.
17

Problems in accessing Russian crude oil would require Neste Oil to ship its raw material needs from other sources resulting in the loss of the cost benefit of having its refineries located close to a major export route of Russian crude oil through the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, a significant portion of the crude oil and other feedstocks required for the operations of Neste Oil is currently supplied by a few major Russian suppliers and there is no assurance that Neste Oil will continue to be able to procure the desired quantities of crude oil and other feedstocks from these suppliers at competitive prices or at all. In addition, as a result of the recent and possible future industry consolidation in Russia, the number of oil suppliers has decreased, and may continue to decrease, which may result in less favourable supply terms. The major suppliers of vegetable oils are located in Southeast Asia and of waste animal fat in Australasia, Europe, and North and South America. Neste Oil's access to different vegetable oils and other renewable feedstocks might be interrupted as a result of, among other things, governmental restrictions, economic and trade sanctions, regional, political, economic or social instability or problems in transporting sufficient quantities of feedstock to Neste Oil's renewable refineries. Any significant and extended interruptions in deliveries by one or more of these suppliers may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Neste Oil has an ownership interest of 49.99 per cent. of shares and 50.0 per cent. of votes in the Swedish bitumen and naphthenics producer Nynas AB. The configurations of Nynas's refineries are oriented towards refining certain dual purpose crude oil qualities from Venezuela to produce both bitumen and naphthenics. Therefore, limitations in deliveries of these crude oil qualities could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of Nynas AB and, as a result, a material adverse effect on the value of, and expected cash flow derived from, Neste Oil's interest in Nynas AB.
The implementation o f biofuel legislation in the EU and other key market areas may influence the speed at which the demand fo r these fuels develops and the use o f the feedstocks employed in producing them and may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.
The EU Renewable Energy Directive required all EU member states to have national regulations in place to implement the directive as of the beginning of 2011, which resulted in intensive legislative work in many EU countries. Many EU countries will continue to work on implementing sustainability criteria and greenhouse gas saving targets on the feedstock used for biofuel production, which may have an impact on the cost or availability of the planned feedstock base. Based on the EU Renewable Energy Directive, the legislators have set mandatory requirements for the increasing use of biofuels. These legislative changes may influence the speed at which the demand for these fuels develop and have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. The EU Renewable Energy Directive is currently under review and is planned to be amended. The impact of these planned amendments may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
The failure to capture the anticipated benefits from NEXBTL renewable diesel investments could have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.
Neste Oil has invested more than EUR 1.5 billion over the last five years in building renewable diesel capacity in Porvoo, Finland, Singapore and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Neste Oil's annual production capacity of renewable diesel for 2014 amounted to 2.1 million tonnes with total revenue of EUR 2.3 billion. Neste Oil has created a sustainable business and will now further concentrate on developing its global customer base and supply chain, achieving high levels of utilisation and improving the profitability of its business. Any failure to capture the benefits from NEXBTL investments or to operate the refineries as planned would, if materialised, have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Legal or regulatory proceedings or claims could have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.
Neste Oil has extensive international operations and is involved in, or a subject of, a number of legal and regulatory proceedings and claims relating to its operations. For information in relation to these proceedings, see "Business o f Neste Oil--Legal Proceedings." It is inherently difficult to predict the outcome of legal, regulatory and other adversarial proceedings or claims, and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of such proceedings or claims, whether existing or arising in the future. Any unfavorable judgment against Neste Oil in relation to any legal or regulatory proceedings or claims or settlement could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
A significant portion o f Neste Oil's employees are members o f labour unions and Neste Oil may face labour disruptions that could interfere with its operations and have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.
Neste Oil is subject to the risk of labour disputes and adverse employee relations. Further, the majority of employees of Neste Oil are represented by labour unions under several collective bargaining agreements. However, not all employees
18

of Neste Oil represented by labour unions are currently bound by valid collective bargaining agreements. In addition, organisations collectively representing Neste Oil and other employers in its industry may not be able to renegotiate satisfactory collective labour agreements when they expire. In addition, existing labour agreements of Neste Oil may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at any of its facilities in the future. Neste Oil has experienced work stoppages in the past.
If such labour disputes or other adverse employee relations, including but not limited to strikes and work stoppages, or problems with the labour unions or collective bargaining agreements, occur, it may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
The loss o f employees in key positions may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.
The future operating results of Neste Oil depend to a large extent upon the continued contributions of its senior management and personnel and, therefore, Neste Oil depends largely on its ability to recruit, train, motivate and retain highly skilled employees. However, there is fierce competition for employees with the level of experience and qualifications in the business that Neste Oil depends upon, which could result in significantly increased personnel costs. Accordingly, it may be increasingly difficult for Neste Oil to hire and/or retain qualified personnel.
If Neste Oil cannot recruit, train, retain and/or motivate qualified personnel, it may be unable to compete effectively in its current business and the successful implementation of Neste Oil's strategies may be limited or prevented, which in each case could have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Currency exchange ratefluctuations may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.
Neste Oil is exposed to foreign exchange risks due to the fact that its operating expenses, except for procurement of crude oil, vegetable oils and other feedstocks as well as time-chartering costs of its tanker fleet, are mainly recorded in euro, whereas most of Neste Oil's sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. If the value of the currency in which Neste Oil incurs its costs (i.e., the euro) strengthens relative to the value of the currency in which it sells its products (i.e., the U.S. dollar), it may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Neste Oil reports its financial results in euro. Therefore, Neste Oil also faces a currency translation risk to the extent that the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of its subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the euro. In order to prepare its financial statements, Neste Oil must translate the values of those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into euro at the applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the euro against other currencies will affect the value of these items in the consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency.
Neste Oil is also exposed to longer-term economic exposures with respect to foreign exchange rates. Changes in exchange rate levels for an extended period may have a material adverse effect on the competitive position of Neste Oil relative to its competitors.
Although Neste Oil seeks to manage its foreign exchange risks in order to minimise any negative impact caused by exchange rate volatility, there can be no assurance that Neste Oil will be able to do so successfully. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, in particular the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro, may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. In particular, any long-term weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects, since Neste Oil's hedging arrangements are typically made for limited time periods, generally for periods of 12 months.
Credit and counterparty risk may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.
Neste Oil's credit and counterparty risk arises from sales, hedging, and trading transactions, as well as cash investments. The risk is linked to the potential failure of a counterparty to meet its contractual payment obligations and is, therefore, dependent on the creditworthiness of the counterparty and the size of the exposure concerned. The amount of risk is quantified at the expected loss to Neste Oil in the event of a default by the counterparty. Credit and counterparty risk may, if materialised, have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
19

Neste Oil is exposed to the uncertainty in the global financial markets, which may have a material adverse effect on the availability o ffinancing.
Whilst Neste Oil's principal source of liquidity is expected to be cash generated from operations, Neste Oil may need to raise financing from time to time. Neste Oil seeks to reduce its liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying both the sources as well as the maturity profile of its borrowings and by maintaining access to unutilised, committed credit facilities at all times. Inability to raise financing could result in delays or reduction or termination of certain operations, which may, in turn, have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Trading activities may result in losses.
As part of the management of risks relating to fluctuations in prices of crude oil, vegetable oils and other commodities related to Neste Oil's business, Neste Oil conducts trading operations in, and relating to, these commodities. Trading is conducted on international and regional markets, and involves spot transactions, such as contracts for future delivery, as well as options and other derivative products. While Neste Oil has risk management procedures in place designed to limit its exposure to risks relating to trading operations, there can be no assurance that Neste Oil will not sustain losses in the future as a result of adverse movements in commodity prices or other factors affecting its trading positions. This may, if materialised, have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Neste Oil is chartering tonnage fo r its logistic needs, and problems or delays in accessing shipping capacity may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.
Neste Oil provides logistics services for the supply of raw materials to Neste Oil's refineries and for the transport of refined petroleum products from its refineries to destinations in Finland, in the Baltic Sea area and internationally. In April 2014, Neste Oil completed the sale of five tankers and three tugs to companies owned by Finland's National Emergency Supply Agency and Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company and chartered these vessels back on long term contracts. Currently Neste Oil owns one crude oil carrier and two product tankers. However, in accordance with the restructuring of its shipping business, Neste Oil plans to sell these vessels at a later stage. After the completion of the restructuring of its shipping business, Neste Oil may need to lease additional shipping capacity to meet its future marine transportation service needs to and from its refineries, and problems or delays in access to additional shipping capacity may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Maritime disasters may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil, including its reputation.
The vessels owned by Neste Oil and/or chartered to Neste Oil are subject to inherent risks, including the risks of maritime disaster, damage to the environment and loss of or damage to cargo and property. Such events can be caused by mechanical failure, human error, adverse weather conditions or piracy, among other factors, in the areas where vessels owned by Neste Oil and/or chartered to Neste Oil operates. The occurrence of any of these events may, either directly or indirectly due to negative publicity, have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Neste Oil is not insured against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by operational catastrophes or deliberate sabotage.
Neste Oil's industrial assets are insured to their estimated full replacement values by property and business interruption insurances, which cover all customary risks, including damages caused by breakage. Neste Oil's marine cargo and inland transit insurance programme covers damage resulted to cargoes associated with Neste Oil's business and storage associated with cargoes. However, Neste Oil is not insured against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by operational catastrophes or deliberate sabotage. Despite insurance coverage, Neste Oil could incur significant uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to the reputation of Neste Oil and a substantial loss of operational capacity, which may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. In accordance with customary market practice, Neste Oil's assets are not insured against wear and tear and other gradually progressive occurrence, which may also have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. For further information on Neste Oil's insurance coverage, please see "Business o f Neste Oil--Insurance".

Neste Oil has operations and investments in certain countries that may be exposed to economic disruption inherent to such countries.
Neste Oil has operations and investments in countries that may be exposed to economic disruptions. These countries are subject to greater political, economic and social uncertainties than countries with more developed institutional structures, and the risk of loss resulting from changes in law, economic and social upheaval and other factors may be substantial. Among the more significant risks of operating and investing in these countries are those arising from establishment or enforcement of foreign exchange restrictions, which could effectively prevent Neste Oil from repatriating profits or liquidating assets and withdrawing from one or more of these countries, and changes in tax regulations or enforcement mechanisms, which could reduce substantially or eliminate any revenues derived from operations in these countries and reduce significantly the value of assets related to such operations. If any one of the above risks materialise, it may, singly or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Compliance with, and changes in, environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.
Neste Oil's operations and products are subject to extensive environmental, chemicals control and consumer protection laws and regulations adopted by the EU and other jurisdictions in which Neste Oil operates. The nature of certain of Neste Oil's businesses exposes Neste Oil to risks of environmental costs and liabilities arising from the manufacture, use, storage, disposal and maritime and inland transport and sale of materials that may be considered to be contaminants when released into the environment. Neste Oil products are classified as chemicals in the EU and other jurisdictions. Environmental liabilities may also arise through the acquisition or ownership or operation of properties or businesses.
The Industrial Emissions Directive and the oil refineries' best available techniques reference document (REF BREF) requirements adopted by the EU will require the use of best available technology (BAT) in emission control. The requirement may call for significant additional expenditures at oil refineries.
Because of the nature of their business operations, oil refining, oil retail and shipping companies, including Neste Oil, may become subject to increasingly stringent environmental and other regulatory requirements. New environmental initiatives could result in significant additional expenditures or reduction or termination of certain operations, which may, in turn, have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Neste Oil will need to acquire emission rights from the market and this may have, directly or indirectly, an impact on allproduction activities o fNeste Oil and an impact on the competitiveness o f different technologies andfuels.
Based on the EU emission trading scheme ("ETS") Phase III (2013-2020), Neste Oil has received emission rights of approximately 2.2-2.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year, and has been acquiring rights from the market to cover for the shortfall in its emission allowances between 2013 and 2020.
Manufacture of refined petroleum products has been included in the EU list of sectors that are at risk of `carbon leakage'. The issue of carbon leakage relates to the risk that companies in sectors subject to strong international competition might relocate from the EU to third countries with less stringent constraints on greenhouse gas emissions. Without such inclusion, there would not have been possibility for free emission credits during the EU ETS Phase III period (2013 2020).
The climate change and emission trading issues are expected to have, directly or indirectly, an impact on all production activities of Neste Oil and have an impact on the competitiveness of various technologies and fuels. Any failure to develop such technologies or fuels may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Introduction o f competing renewable fu el technologies or hybrid and electric engines may have an impact on the demandfo r Neste Oil's products and have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.
According to an estimate of Neste Oil's management, Neste Oil's proprietary NEXBTL renewable diesel production technology is currently the leading commercially proven technology to produce high-quality diesel fuel using renewable feedstocks, however, there can be no assurance that this competitive position will continue. Many companies are investigating ways to develop technologies, such as BTL (biomass-to-liquids) that may eventually be even more competitive than NEXBTL. These might use, for example, lower-cost biomass as feedstock and yield high-quality fuels. At the same time, vehicles powered by hybrid systems and electric engines are beginning to gain ground. Hybrid vehicles include an electric engine and a gasoline- or diesel-powered engine, both of which are smaller than if they were the sole source of power, and make use of regenerative braking. `Plug in' hybrids that can be charged from domestic electrical
21

outlets have also been launched. The relative economy of these vehicles depends on how the electricity used is generated and how much it costs. These vehicles currently suffer from relatively poor battery efficiency, which limits their radius of operation. Purely electrical vehicles face a number of other technical challenges. More rapid than anticipated introduction of new renewable fuel production technologies or new and improved vehicles powered by hybrid systems and electric engines may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Neste Oil may become subject to significant liability related to MTBE.
Neste Oil has sold approximately 4.6 million tonnes of methyl tertiary butyl ether, known as MTBE, to various companies operating in the United States, primarily in California, between 1992 and 2003. There is still public concern in the United States about MTBE contamination of water supplies primarily as a result of leaks from underground storage tanks and pipes. In respect of MTBE contamination, certain researchers and regulatory agencies have expressed concern that MTBE may be a human carcinogen, although scientific research to date has not substantiated these concerns. MTBE opponents have also contended that, since MTBE is more soluble in water than other gasoline components, it is capable of travelling further in groundwater and is more likely to contaminate public and private water wells which, at a minimum, allegedly may result in bad tasting and, therefore, undrinkable water. Lastly, MTBE opponents claim that, due to MTBE's solubility, it is difficult to remediate and, as a result, MTBE clean-ups may be more costly and time consuming than clean-ups associated with other types of gasoline components.
As a result of these concerns, MTBE use has been banned or significantly limited in more than two dozen states of the United States. Since the late 1990's, a series of legal actions has been filed in various states of the United States against various entities in the oil industry, many of them by municipalities and local water agencies alleging contamination of their drinking water supply. In some cases in California, oil companies have entered into multi-million dollar out-of-court settlements resulting in compensation to such water agencies. As a former manufacturer and former supplier/distributor, marketer and importer of MTBE to the United States, Neste Oil recognises that similar claims could be asserted against it by plaintiffs alleging injury or harm or by other defendant companies who have incurred losses and are seeking contribution or indemnity from Neste Oil. Neste Oil has marketed MTBE in countries other than the United States and continues to market MTBE in Europe. As a result, if concerns about MTBE were to be raised in other jurisdictions, cases in those jurisdictions could also be brought against Neste Oil. Such claims in any jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Any military strikes or sustained military campaigns or terrorist activity in the areas or regions where Neste Oil has operations could have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil.
Any military strikes or sustained military campaigns in areas or regions of the world where Neste Oil has operations may affect the business of Neste Oil in unpredictable ways, including forcing Neste Oil to increase security measures and causing disruptions of supplies and markets, loss of property and incapacitation of employees. Further, like other industrial companies, the facilities of Neste Oil may be the target of terrorist activities. Any damage to infrastructure, such as power generation facilities, or injury to employees, that could be direct targets or indirect casualties, of an act of war or terrorism, may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Any disruption of Neste Oil's ability to produce or distribute its products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace or repair and insure Neste Oil's assets, which could have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Neste Oil has interests in oil refining plants, which exposes it to certain additional risks that are customary fo r joint ventures.
Neste Oil has interests, among others, in two joint venture companies, Bahrain Lube Base Oil Company B.S.C and Nynas AB. Neste Oil owns 45 per cent. of the base oil plant in Bahrain and 49.99 per cent. of Nynas AB's refineries. Joint ventures often involve complex risk allocation, decision-making processes and indemnification arrangements. In certain cases, Neste Oil may have less control of such activities than it would have if it had full operational control. Neste Oil's joint venture partners may have economic or business interests or objectives that are inconsistent with, or opposed to, those of Neste Oil, and may exercise veto rights to block certain key decisions or actions that Neste Oil believes are in its or the joint venture's or associate's best interests, or take actions contrary to Neste Oil's instructions, requests, policies or business objectives. If there is any disagreement with a joint venture partner regarding the operations of the relevant joint venture, there can be no assurance that Neste Oil will be able to resolve it in a manner that will be in their best interest.
22

Neste Oil could incur substantial costs or disruptions in its business if it cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorisations.

Neste Oil's operations require numerous permits and authorisations under various laws and regulations. For example, Neste Oil's refineries, NEXBTL plants and terminals have been granted environmental permits under such laws and regulations. These and other authorisations and permits are subject to revocation, renewal or modification and can require operational changes, which may involve significant costs, to limit impacts or potential impacts on the environment and/or health and safety. A violation of these authorisation or permit conditions or other legal or regulatory requirements could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations, injunctions and/or temporary or permanent refinery shutdowns. Neste Oil's refineries in Porvoo and Naantali will be subject to re-application and authority approval, including a BAT evaluation of their respective environmental permits, during 2015-2018.

Risks Relating to the Notes

The Notes may not be a suitable investmentfo r all investors.

Each prospective investor of the Notes must determine, based on its own independent review and such professional advice as it deems appropriate under the circumstances, that its acquisition of the Notes is fully consistent with its financial needs, objectives and condition, complies and is fully consistent with all investment policies, guidelines and restrictions applicable to it and is a fit, proper and suitable investment for it, notwithstanding the clear and substantial risks inherent in investing in or holding the Notes.

A prospective investor may not rely on the Issuer or the Joint Lead Managers or any of their respective affiliates in connection with its determination as to the legality of its acquisition of the Notes or as to the other matters referred to above.

A prospective investor should:

(i)

have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and risks of

investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus or any

applicable supplement;

(ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on its overall investment portfolio;

(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor's currency (see also "--Investors are subject to exchange rate risks i f investors'financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit other than the euro. Government and monetary authorities may impose exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate" below);

(iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant financial markets; and

(v) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.

Should the Issuer become insolvent during the term o f the Notes, an investor may forfeit interest payable on, and the principle amount of, the Notes in whole or in part.

Should the Issuer become insolvent during the term of the Notes, an investor may forfeit interest payable on, and the principle amount of, the Notes in whole or in part. An investor is always solely responsible for the financial consequences of his/her investment decisions.

The Notes will not be obligations o f anyone other than the Issuer and they will not be guaranteed. The Notes are unsecured debt instruments and the Noteholders would be unsecured creditors in the event o f the Issuer's bankruptcy or other insolvency.

The Notes will not be obligations of anyone other than the Issuer and they will not be guaranteed. No one other than the Issuer will accept any liability whatsoever in respect of any failure by the Issuer to pay any amount due under the Notes.

23

The Notes are unsecured debt instruments and the Noteholders would be unsecured creditors in the event of the Issuer's bankruptcy or other insolvency. Accordingly, in addition to that any adverse change in the financial condition or future prospects of the Issuer may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of, and may result in a material decline in the market price for, the Notes, such adverse change may endanger the probability that the Noteholder will receive the prompt and full payment, when due, for principal, interest and/or any other amounts and items payable to the Noteholders pursuant to the Notes from time to time.
There is no prior public market fo r the Notes and there can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop, which, in turn, may result in a material decline in the marketprice o f the Notes and the liquidity o f the Notes may be adversely affected.
The Notes constitute a new issue of securities. Prior to the listing of the Notes on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, there is no public market for the Notes. Although application will be made to list the Notes on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, there can be no assurance that such application will be approved. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the Notes will develop, or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop or is not maintained, it may result in a material decline in the market price of the Notes, and the liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. Further, if additional and competing products are introduced in the markets, this may also result in a material decline in the market price and value of the Notes.
Noteholders should be aware of the prevailing and widely reported global credit market conditions (which continue at the date of this Prospectus), whereby there is a lack of liquidity in the secondary market for instruments similar to the Notes. Such lack of liquidity may result in investors suffering losses on the Notes in secondary resales even if there is no decline in the performance of the assets of the Issuer. The Issuer cannot predict which of these circumstances will change and whether, if and when they do change, there will be a more liquid market for the Notes and instruments similar to the Notes at that time.
Investors are subject to exchange rate risks i f investors'financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit other than the euro. Government and monetary authorities may impose exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate.
The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in euro. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than the euro. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of the euro or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to the euro would decrease (1) the Investor's Currency equivalent yield on the Notes, (2) the Investor's Currency equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (3) the Investor's Currency equivalent market value of the Notes.
Government and monetary authorities may impose exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal at all.
The fixed interest rate o f the Notes exposes the investors in the Notes to the risk that the price o f such security could fa ll as a result o f changes in the market interest rate.
The Notes bear interest on their outstanding principal at a fixed interest rate. A holder of a security with a fixed interest rate is exposed to the risk that the price of such security could fall as a result of changes in the market interest rate. Market interest rates follow the changes in general economic conditions, and are affected by, among many other things, demand and supply for money, liquidity, inflation rate, economic growth, central banks' benchmark rates, implied future rates, and changes and expectations related thereto.
While the nominal compensation rate of a security with a fixed interest rate is fixed during the life of such security or during a certain period of time, current interest rates on capital markets (market interest rates) typically change continuously. In case market interest rates increase, the market price of such a security typically falls until the yield of such security is approximately equal to the market interest rates. If market interest rates fall, the price of a security with a fixed interest rate typically increases, until the yield of such a security is approximately equal to market interest rates. Consequently, the Noteholders should be aware that movements of market interest rates may result in a material decline in the market price of the Notes and can lead to losses for the Noteholders if they sell the Notes. Further, the past performance of the Notes is not an indication of their future performance.
24

Interest payments made by the Issuer or a securities dealer to Noteholders who are not resident in Finland fo r tax purposes may be subject to Finnish withholding tax.
Noteholders who are not resident in Finland for tax purposes and who do not engage in trade or business through a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business in Finland will not be subject to Finnish taxes on interest or gains realised on the sale of the Notes. However, interest payments made by the Issuer or a securities dealer (i.e., a financial institution making the payment) to Noteholders who are not resident in Finland for tax purposes may, nevertheless, be subject to Finnish withholding tax, unless the identity of the Noteholders can be appropriately established. It may be difficult for investors holding interests in the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream (especially when the Notes are held in a nominee account) to appropriately establish their identity as non-Finnish residents. Furthermore, the tax gross-up contained in Condition 11 of the terms and conditions of the Notes provides that no additional amounts will be payable to, or to a third party on behalf of, a holder of a Note who would not be liable or subject to the withholding or deduction by making a declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for exemption to the relevant tax authority.
As a result, non-Finnish residents who are not liable for tax in Finland, yet who are unable, for whatever reason, to establish their identity as a non-Finnish resident, may have amounts in respect of taxation withheld from payments of interest under the Notes. Whilst it may be possible for non-Finnish residents who are not liable for tax in Finland to reclaim amounts that have been withheld, this would require an application to the Finnish taxation authorities, which represents an added administrative burden and may be a time consuming process. Noteholders should therefore consult their tax advisers with respect to payments that may be received under the Notes.
The Notes are not currently rated by any rating agency.
The Notes are not currently rated by any rating agency. Accordingly, investors are not able to refer to any independent credit rating when evaluating factors that may affect the value of the Notes.
In case any payment under the Notes has not been claimed within three years from the original due date thereof, the right to such payment shall become prescribed.
In case any payment under the Notes has not been claimed within three years from the original due date thereof, the right to such payment shall become prescribed. Such prescription may cause financial losses to such Noteholders who have not claimed payment under the Notes within the prescription time of three years.
Noteholders are dependent on Euroclear Finland's operations and systems.
The Notes were issued in the book-entry securities system of Euroclear Finland. Under the Finnish Act on Book-Entry System, notes will not be evidenced by any physical note or document of title other than statements of account made by Euroclear Finland or its account operator. Hence, as the Notes are dematerialised securities, title to the Notes is recorded and transfer of the Notes effected only through the book-entry system and register maintained by Euroclear Finland and its account operators. Therefore, timely and successful completion of transactions relating to the Notes, including but not limited to transfers of, and payments made under, the Notes, depend on the fact that the book-entry securities system is operational on the time when the transaction is executed. Any malfunction or delay in the book-entry securities system may result in the transaction not to take place as expected or to be delayed, which may cause financial losses or damage to the Noteholders whose rights depend on the timely and successful completion of the transaction.
The Issuer or any other third party, including the Joint Lead Managers, will not assume responsibility for the timely and full functionality of the book-entry securities system.
Noteholders holding interests in the Notes through nominee book-entry accounts will not be able to enforce any rights under the Notes directly against the Issuer.
Persons holding interests in the Notes through nominee book-entry accounts, e.g., in Euroclear or Clearstream (rather than Euroclear Finland directly), or through other custody/sub-custody arrangements so that the Notes are held on a nominee omnibus account in Euroclear Finland will not be recorded as the legal/beneficial owners of such Notes under Finnish law and such holders will, therefore, not be entitled to enforce any rights under the Notes directly against the Issuer. Such persons should look to the terms of business of the respective clearing system or custodian, as applicable, with respect to indirect enforcement of their rights, as well as regarding the possibility to transfer the Notes to a bookentry account with Euroclear Finland held directly by the Noteholder.
25

There can be no assurance o f the impact o f any change o f laws orpractices.
The Notes are governed by the laws of Finland, as in force from time to time. Finnish laws (including, but not limited to, tax laws) and regulations governing the Notes may change during the validity of the Notes, and new judicial decisions can be given and administrative practices take place. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any such possible change of laws or regulations, or new judicial decision or administrative practice taking place after the date of this Prospectus. Hence, if materialised, such event may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments.
The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisors to determine whether and to what extent (1) the Notes are legal investments for it, (2) the Notes can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any of the Notes. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of the Notes under any applicable risk based capital or similar rules.
There are no limitations to the Issuer's incurrence o f additional debt in thefuture.
The Issuer is not prohibited from issuing further debt ranking pari passu with its existing obligations. If the Issuer incurs significant additional debt ranking equally with the Notes, it will increase the number of claims that would be entitled to share rateably with the Noteholders in any proceeds distributed in connection with an insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceeding. Further, any provision that confers, purports to confer, or waives a right to create security interest in favour of third parties, such as a negative pledge, is ineffective against third parties since (i) it is a question of a contractual arrangement only being binding upon the parties to such contractual arrangement, (ii) there is no specific legislation in Finland providing beneficiaries of negative pledge undertakings and covenants with a preferred position vis-a-vis the claims of third parties, and (iii) no registry or public record exists in Finland through which negative pledge undertakings and covenants could be filed to obtain a preferred position. Should the Issuer breach its obligations under such undertakings and covenants and create a security interest in favour of a third party, such third party would obtain a valid and enforceable security interest over the pledged property ranking ahead of any later security over the same pledged property but ranking behind of any prior security over the same pledged property.
The Notes do not, as a rule, contain covenants governing the Issuer's operations and do not limit its ability to merge, effect asset sales or otherwise effect significant transactions that may have a material adverse effect on the Notes and the Noteholders.
As a rule, the Notes do not contain covenants governing the Issuer's operations or other provisions designed to protect Noteholders from a reduction in the creditworthiness of the Issuer. In particular, the terms and conditions of the Notes do not, except for the Change of Control condition (see Condition 9 of the "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes") that grants the Noteholders the right of repayment of the Notes in certain limited circumstances, restrict the Issuer's ability to enter into a merger, asset sale or other significant transaction that could materially alter its existence, jurisdiction of organisation or regulatory regime and/or its composition and business. In the event the Issuer was to enter into such a transaction, Noteholders could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, the Change of Control condition does not restrict any of the current shareholders of the Issuer, including the State (acting through the Prime Minister's Office), from disposing any or all of their shareholdings.
Premature repayment following a change o f control in the Issuer may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes o f such Noteholders who elect not to exercise their right to get their Notes prematurely repaid or it may cause material financial losses or damage, among other things, to such Noteholders who had prepared themselves to have the amount o f the Notes invested until the initial maturity o f the Notes.
As specified in "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes", the Noteholders are entitled to demand premature repayment of the Notes in case of a Change of Control. Such premature repayment may have a material adverse effect on Neste Oil's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, Neste Oil's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes of such Noteholders who elect not to exercise their right to get their Notes prematurely repaid.
Furthermore, in case at least 75 per cent. of the aggregate volume of the Notes has been repaid pursuant to a demand by the Noteholders based on a Change of Control (as defined in Condition 9 of the "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes"), the Issuer is entitled to prepay also the remaining outstanding Notes by notifying the Noteholders of such prepayment.
26

Such early repayment initiated by the Issuer may cause material financial losses or damage, among other things, to such Noteholders who had prepared themselves to have the amount of the Notes invested until the initial maturity of the Notes. Amendments to the Notes bind all Noteholders. As specified in "Terms and Conditions o f the Notes", the terms and conditions of the Notes may be amended in certain circumstances with the required consent of a defined majority of the Noteholders. The terms and conditions of the Notes contain provisions for Noteholders to call and attend meetings to consider and vote upon matters affecting their interests generally. Resolutions passed at such meetings can bind all Noteholders, including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority. This may cause financial losses, among other things, to all Noteholders, including such Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority. The Noteholders have no voting rights at the GeneralMeetings of shareholders of the Issuer. The Noteholders have no voting rights with respect to the General Meetings of shareholders of the Issuer. Consequently, in the Issuer's General Meetings of shareholders the Noteholders cannot influence any decisions by the Issuer to redeem the Notes or any decisions by the Issuer's shareholders concerning, for instance, the capital structure of the Issuer.

BUSINESS OF NESTE OIL
Overview
Neste Oil is a refining and marketing company, with a production focus on premium-quality, lower-emission traffic fuels. Neste Oil produces a comprehensive range of major petroleum products and is, according to the estimates of Neste Oil's management, the world's largest supplier of renewable diesel measured by volume. Neste Oil has operations in 14 countries, including Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United States. Neste Oil has three business areas and four reporting segments. The business areas are Oil Products, Renewable Products, and Oil Retail. The reporting segments are Oil Products, Renewable Products, Oil Retail, and Others. In 2014, Neste Oil had sales of EUR 15.0 billion. As at 31 December 2014, Neste Oil had 4,833 employees.
Neste Oil's predecessor, Neste Oy ("Neste"), was founded in 1948 in order to secure Finland's oil supply. Neste was listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange in 1995, and in 1997 the Finnish Council of State decided to merge Neste with Imatran Voima Oy to form Fortum Corporation ("Fortum"), which was listed in December 1998. The merged oil and electricity company continued its operations until 2005, when the oil business was spun off as a separate company and the shares in Neste Oil were listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Neste Oil's shares are listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange under the trading code NES1V.HSE.
Neste Oil was registered in the Trade Register maintained by the National Board of Patents and Registration of Finland on 1 May 2004, and its business identity code is 1852302-9. Its registered address is Keilaranta 21, FI-02150 Espoo, Finland, and its telephone number is +358 10 45811. Neste Oil is a public limited company under the Finnish Companies Act (624/2006, as amended). On 4 February 2015, Neste Oil announced that the Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General Meeting of shareholders to be held on 1 April 2015 that the Company's name is changed to Neste Corporation. The proposal for the name change will be presented as a proposed amendment of the Articles of Association at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on 1 April 2015.
According to article 2 of its Articles of Association, the field of business of Neste Oil is to engage, both directly and through its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, in oil and gas production, in the oil, energy and chemical industries and trading in these businesses, in merchant shipping, in engineering, and other business operations related to the above. Neste Oil may own and administer real estate, shares, and other securities.
Corporate History
Neste was founded in 1948 to secure Finland's oil supply. Neste's first refinery came on-stream in Naantali in 1957, and the first crude oil cargo arrived there in June 1957. In 1960, Neste decided to double the capacity of the Naantali refinery, which became available in 1962. The Porvoo refinery, Neste's second refinery, came on-stream in 1966.
In the 1970s, Neste became the largest company in Finland, and it had an important role in balancing Finland's trade with the Soviet Union. Petrochemicals and plastics, oil drilling and natural gas emerged in Finland through the efforts of Neste.
In the 1980s, Neste became involved in international chemical business and crude oil trading. Among others, Neste operated Neste and Kesoil service stations.
In the 1990s, Neste's Exploration & Production ("E&P") business in the North Sea and the Middle East expanded, and Neste service stations started operating in the Baltic Rim countries. Borealis, the petrochemicals joint venture with Statoil, and Gasum, the natural gas company co-owned with Gazprom, were established. Petrochemicals operations were divested in late 1990s. Gasum's shares were transferred to Fortum in 2004.
On 27 November 1995, Neste's initial public offering was completed and its shares were listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. In 1997, the Finnish Council of State decided to merge Neste with Imatran Voima Oy to form Fortum, which was listed in December 1998. Fortum was listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, and Neste became Fortum's subsidiary. In 2002, Fortum sold the Norwegian E&P business and Omani production assets. In 2003, Fortum commenced preparations to separate its oil business into a new company and, subsequently, to list the new company on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. In 2004, the cornerstone of a new diesel production line in the Porvoo refinery was laid.
In 2005, Neste Oil Corporation was separated from Fortum. Neste Oil's shares were first quoted on the Helsinki Stock Exchange on 18 April 2005. Further in 2005, Neste Oil decided to build a NEXBTL renewable diesel production plant in Porvoo, Finland, and in 2006 a second renewable diesel plant in Porvoo, with the aim of becoming the world's leading producer of renewable diesel.
43

In 2007, Neste Oil decided to build a NEXBTL renewable diesel plant in Singapore. In addition, Neste Oil inaugurated a new diesel line and a renewable diesel plant in Porvoo, and celebrated 40 years of operations at its Technology Centre. Furthermore, Neste Oil and Stora Enso joined forces in biofuel development.
In 2008, Neste Oil decided to build Europe's largest renewable diesel plant in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In 2009, Neste Oil's second renewable diesel plant was commissioned in Porvoo, and Neste Oil and Stora Enso inaugurated a biofuel demonstration facility in Varkaus, Finland.
In 2010, Neste Oil completed its largest-ever maintenance turnaround at the Porvoo refinery, and the new NEXBTL plant in Singapore was started up successfully.
In 2011, Neste Oil's fourth renewable diesel plant, in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, was commissioned in September 2011, and Neste Oil started up a new premium-quality base oil production plant in Bahrain, together with Bahrain Petroleum Company ("Bapco") and The Oil and Gas Holding Company B.S.C. (c) ("nogaholding"). In 2011, Neste Oil also divested various non-core businesses: the gas business in Estonia was sold to Alexela; the polyalphaolefins ("PAO") plant in Beringen, Belgium, to Chevron Phillips Chemical; and Neste Oil's 50 per cent. stake in an iso-octane plant in Edmonton, Canada, to Canadian-based Keyera Corporation.
In 2012, a scheduled maintenance turnaround was conducted at the Naantali refinery, and Neste Oil signed an agreement to sell its retail station network in Poland to Shell.
In 2013, Neste Oil invested a total of approximately EUR 42 million in improving the energy efficiency and operational reliability of its Porvoo refinery. Neste Oil also decided to invest EUR 65 million to build an isomerisation unit at its Porvoo refinery. Neste Oil's sale of its retail station network in Poland to Shell was completed and Neste Oil announced its plans to exit shipping business in 2013.
In 2014, Neste Oil completed the arrangements to sell its key vessels to companies owned by Finland's National Emergency Supply Agency and Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company and outsource its ship management functions to OSM Ship Management Finland Oy. Neste Oil's chartering operations will continue as part of the Neste Oil organization. Neste Oil has treated the sold vessels' sale-and-leaseback agreements as structured entities in its consolidated financial statements. In 2014, Neste Oil incorporated its electricity distribution operations into Kilpilahden Sahkonsiirto Oy and decided to sell all shares of Kilpilahden Sahkonsiirto Oy to InfraVia European Fund II, an infrastructure fund managed by InfraVia. The sale was completed on 2 January 2015.
Outlook and Profit Forecast
The following outlook is included in Neste Oil's financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014:
Developments in the global economy have been reflected in the oil, renewable fuel, and renewable feedstock markets; and volatility in these markets is expected to continue.
Global oil demand is anticipated to continue increasing, but growth estimates are generally slightly below 1 million barrels per day for 2015. The forward reference refining margin is currently reasonably strong. However, the refining capacity growth of more than 1 million barrels per day in Asia and the Middle East is expected to create some pressure on global product supply demand balance particularly during the second half of the year. Transatlantic supply demand balance is also dependent on the planned and unplanned refinery shutdowns. Gasoline margins are currently supported by contango buying, and the coming driving season typically supports gasoline market in the spring. Middle distillate imports from Russia, the Middle East, and the United States are expected to remain on a high level also in 2015.
Vegetable oil price differentials are expected to vary, depending on crop outlooks, weather phenomena, and variations in demand for different feedstocks, but no fundamental changes in the drivers influencing long-term average feedstock price differentials are expected. Feedstock prices have been on a downward trend, but vegetable oil price differentials have remained narrower than the historical average. Market volatility in feedstock and oil prices is expected to continue, which will have an impact on the Renewable Products segment's profitability.
In 2015, the Neste Oil group's investments are expected to total approximately EUR 450 million, including approximately EUR 100 million for a major turnaround at the Porvoo refinery. The Porvoo turnaround is scheduled to start in April 2015 and is expected to last for approximately 8 weeks. Product inventory of approximately EUR 200 million is planned to be built in anticipation of the turnaround. The turnaround is expected to have an approximately EUR 70 million negative impact on Oil Products segment's comparable operating profit.
Crude oil price changes, supply and demand balances, together with uncertainties related to political decision-making on biofuel mandates, the U.S. Blender's Tax Credit and other incentives will be reflected in the oil and renewable fuel markets.
44

Based on the above, Neste Oil expects the Neste Oil group's full-year 2015 comparable operating profit to be robust, although probably lower than that reached in 2014.
The assumptions upon which Neste Oil has based its forecast and which the Board of Directors and the Executive Board of Neste Oil can influence include profitability through usual operational measures such as productivity and decision of investments, cost structure and margin hedging. Other factors expressed in this section "--Outlook and Profit Forecast" are generally outside of the influence of the Board of Directors and Executive Board of Neste Oil. The Issuer confirms that the above forecast has been properly prepared on the basis stated and that the basis of accounting is consistent with the accounting policies of the Issuer.
The above statements include forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees o ffuture financial performance and Neste Oil's actual results could differ materially fro m those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements as a result o f many factors. Neste Oil cautions prospective investors not to place undue reliance on theseforward-looking statements, which speak only as at the date o f this Prospectus.
Corporate Strategy
Neste Oil focuses on providing high-quality solutions for cleaner traffic by expanding the raw material base and leveraging its refining excellence. Neste Oil's vision is to be the preferred partner in cleaner traffic fuel solutions. These solutions are essential in helping meet the growing amount of energy needed in traffic and transport as sustainably as possible. The premium-quality fuels developed by Neste Oil, with their smaller environmental footprint, open up excellent potential for cleaner traffic and transport. In addition, Neste Oil's research and development on renewable raw materials and refining technologies for these materials makes a valuable contribution to efforts aimed at reducing the world's dependence on crude oil.
Neste Oil's long experience in developing cleaner fuels, together with its unique refining and technological expertise and sustainable business model, provide a solid foundation for implementing its strategy.
Business Area Strategies
Neste Oil's three business areas, Oil Products, Renewable Products, and Oil Retail, support the implementation of Neste Oil's strategy.
The strategic role of Oil Products is to maximise the cash flow provided by selling the products Neste Oil refines and generate profitable growth on the expanding market for premium-quality base oil fuels.
The strategic goal of Renewable Products is to generate profitable growth on the expanding market for premium-quality renewable products.
The strategic role of Oil Retail is to act as a marketing channel for Neste Oil's products and maximise the cash flow generated by product sales and leverage market potential in the countries around the Baltic.
Oil Products and Renewable Products business areas are also responsible for their production functions and Oil Products manages the logistics operations of Neste Oil.
Strategy Implementation During 2014
In addition to day-to-day operations, Neste Oil implements its strategy through value creation programs. The value creation programs aim to increase collaboration and focus activities on what is essential for the development of the Company. All programs have ambitious and measurable objectives monitored regularly by the Company's management and Board of Directors. For more information, see "--Value Creation Programs" below. The way forward operating model, which is based on Neste Oil's values and guides daily work, is an integral part of the implementation of Neste Oil's strategy. For more information, see "--Way Forward Operating Model" below
In 2014, Neste Oil defined two new strategic targets: to become the Baltic Sea downstream champion and to grow in the global renewable feedstock-based markets.
Value Creation Programs
Five value creation programs were established as part of the annual strategy review in 2011 to be Neste Oil's most important focal areas in terms of strategic implementation during the following few years. During the strategy process in 2013, the number of value creation programs was reduced from five to four programs, as most of the targets of one program continued in the way forward operating model. The current value creation programs of Neste Oil are: Profitable Growth, Productivity, Renewable Feedstock and Customer Focus.
45

Profitable Growth
The Profitable Growth program is designed to ensure that Neste Oil achieves its business targets and creates profitable growth and new opportunities in all business areas.
Productivity
The Productivity program is designed to improve production efficiency of Neste Oil, safety at all Neste Oil refineries, cost efficiency and agility in the logistics network. The aim is also to help operations to meet changing business needs and to increase capacity of renewable products.
Renewable Feedstock
The goal of the Renewable Feedstock program is to improve the availability of competitive feedstock and processing capabilities and to increase the use of waste and residues as feedstock.
Customer Focus
Working through the Customer Focus program, Neste Oil aims to create value together with customers and strengthen the Company's customer-focused mindset.
Way Forward Operating Model
The way forward operating model was introduced at Neste Oil in 2013. The way forward operating model originated in Neste Oil's will to remain competitive in the changing operating environment. In the way forward operating model, Neste Oil particularly focuses on the way of working in order to being able to respond to the requirements of Neste Oil's industry and to reach Neste Oil's strategic objectives.
The way forward operating model is based on Neste Oil's values, and it has been defined on the basis of an organisation culture survey. The underlying idea of the way forward operating model is to develop Neste Oil into a more profitable, a more customer-focused and a safer company where personnel enjoy their work and feel fulfilled.
Baltic Sea Downstream Champion
The Baltic region is Neste Oil's home market where it wants to strengthen its position further. The strong competitiveness of Neste Oil's refineries is based on its advanced production structure and excellent location, considering Neste Oil's customer base and feedstock procurement. NEXBTL renewable diesel makes Neste Oil's product offering unique to consumers, business customers, and fuel distributors.
Growth in the Global Renewable Feedstock-based Markets
According to the estimates of Neste Oil's management, Neste Oil is the world's largest producer of renewable diesel. Neste Oil is able to refine NEXBTL diesel based on its proprietary technology from over ten different renewable feedstocks globally in Neste Oil's four production units. Neste Oil sees interesting growth opportunities also outside the fuel market, such as bio-based chemistry products that can replace fossil products.
Description of Operations by Business Area
Neste Oil's organisation was restructured into three business areas and eight common functions as of 16 June 2014. The business areas act as profit centres and are responsible for their customers, products, and business development. The business areas are: Oil Products, Renewable Products and Oil Retail. The common functions are: Finance, Strategy, Human Resources and HSEQ, Technology, Communications and Brand Marketing, Sustainability and Public Affairs, Legal Affairs and Internal Audit.
Oil Products
General
Neste Oil's Oil Products focuses on premium-grade traffic fuels and other high value-added petroleum products that are sold to customers worldwide. Oil Products is also responsible for procuring the feedstocks used at Neste Oil's refineries and optimisation procedures. Neste Oil is aiming to develop its presence in diesel fuel and VHVI base oil, both of which have been identified as growth segments. According to the estimates of Neste Oil's management, Neste Oil is the leading supplier of clean fuels around the Baltic Rim and an active player on the broader international market. The product range includes gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and bunker fuel, heating oil and heavy fuel oil, base oils, gasoline components, specialty fuels, solvents, liquid petroleum gas ("LPG"), and bitumen.
46

According to the estimates of Neste Oil's management, Neste Oil is the leading wholesale supplier of lower-emissions fuels and petroleum products around the Baltic. Neste Oil offers its customers in the region a wide range of customised products and fuel blends, together with various flexible solutions for helping them meet their bio mandate needs and other requirements. Customers around the Baltic benefit from a fast and flexible service that can supply multiple products in a single shipment even at short notice.
Neste Oil is also active on the international oil market and sells its petroleum products on the wider European and North American markets. According to the estimates of Neste Oil's management, Neste Oil is one of the world's leading suppliers of Group III base oil.
Refineries
Neste Oil's fossil fuel refineries are located in Porvoo and Naantali, Finland. Neste Oil is planning to initiate a major development program to rationalise its operations. Investments totalling approximately EUR 500 million are to be made in growth and optimising production at the Company's Porvoo and Naantali refineries in Finland. The plan is to closely integrate refinery operations at Porvoo and Naantali to achieve better operational and cost efficiency. The planned program of the new investments covers a number of projects, of which the largest will be the construction of an SDA (solvent de-asphalting) feedstock pre-treatment unit costing EUR 200 million at Porvoo. At Naantali, Neste Oil plans to simplify the structure of the refinery and to invest approximately EUR 60 million in various utility-related enhancements. The project to modernise energy generation at the Porvoo refinery announced in May 2013 has been modified and the plan is to implement a power plant investment, valued at more than EUR 250 million, through a joint venture with Veolia group and Borealis. Neste Oil's intention is to make a final decision on the project in the spring 2015, and completion of the investment is scheduled for 2017.
Porvoo Refinery
Neste Oil's Porvoo refinery is one of Europe's most advanced and versatile refineries and is capable of producing a comprehensive range of major petroleum products, as well as NEXBTL renewable diesel. The refinery has a crude refining capacity of 206,000 barrels per day and produces approximately 12 million tonnes of petroleum products per annum. The refinery's average capacity utilisation rate in 2014 was 84 per cent. (2013: 87 per cent.) and output totalled 11.3 million tonnes (2013: 12.0 million tonnes).
Naantali Refinery
Neste Oil's Naantali refinery concentrates on specialty products, such as solvents and bitumen, and has a capacity of 58.000 barrels per day, producing approximately 3 million tonnes of products per annum. The refinery's average capacity utilisation rate in 2014 was 71 per cent. (2013: 78 per cent.) and output totalled 2.0 million tonnes (2013: 2.1 million tonnes).
Other Production Plants
In addition to its own refineries, Neste Oil has a 45 per cent. stake in a joint venture base oil plant in Bahrain, which produces premium quality Group III VHVI (Very High Viscosity Index) base oil used in high-quality lubricants. The other owners of the plant are Bahrain Petroleum Company (Bapco) and nogaholding. The plant has a nominal capacity of 400.000 tonnes per annum, and Neste Oil is responsible for marketing and selling its output. Neste Oil's share of the Bahrain plant's output during 2014 totalled 143 tonnes (2013: 151 tonnes).
Neste Oil also has a 49.99 per cent. holding in Nynas AB, which produces naphthenic oil and bitumen at sites in Europe and North and South America.
Logistics
Neste Oil provides logistics services for the supply of raw materials to Neste Oil's refineries and for the transport of refined petroleum products from its refineries to destinations in Finland, in the Baltic Sea area and internationally. Neste Oil uses both its own and chartered vessels to handle its marine shipments. All vessels used by Neste Oil on the Baltic Sea are ice strengthened.
In April 2014, Neste Oil outsourced most of its fleet and ship management operations. Following the restructuring of operations, Neste Oil was left with three vessels, which Neste Oil plans to divest at a later stage. As a result of outsourcing the ship management functions, Neste Oil is responsible for the commercial operation of the vessels used by it, but the vessels' safety is the responsibility of the crewing and ship management companies in accordance with their safety management systems.
In addition to terminals at the Porvoo and Naantali refineries, Neste Oil has ten coastal terminals in Finland and one terminal each in Estonia, Latvia, and St. Petersburg, Russia. The excellent logistics of these terminals reduce the distances that customers' tanker trucks have to travel and benefits the environment in terms of lower emissions.

Renewable Products
General
According to the estimates of Neste Oil's management, Neste Oil is the world's largest producer of renewable diesel measured by volume, and has invested more than EUR 1.5 billion over the last five years in building renewable diesel capacity in Porvoo, Finland, Singapore, and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. As at the date of this Prospectus, the Company has an annual production capacity of approximately 2 million tonnes of renewable diesel capacity.
Neste Oil sells NEXBTL renewable diesel as a premium-quality bio and diesel component to corporate customers, primarily in Europe and North America. Due to the fuel's high quality, customers can use it very flexibly, optimise their logistics chain very effectively, and blend it into high-quality products. NEXBTL renewable diesel is also sold to distributors as a `ready to go' blend of fossil and renewable diesel. The main markets for NEXBTL renewable diesel are Europe and North America, and it is sold to corporate customers as a premium-quality bio component for blending purposes. Due to its high quality, customers can use it very flexibly and optimise their logistics chain and produce their own quality products. Neste Oil has sold NEXBTL renewable diesel to consumers in Finland since 2008. Neste Green diesel sold at Neste Oil service stations contains a minimum of 10 per cent. of NEXBTL.
Demand for renewable fuels is largely dependent on officially mandated requirements to use renewable energy, which are steadily spreading worldwide. Examples of targets set for bio component usage in traffic fuels, as a proportion of energy content, include 10 per cent. by 2020 in EU countries and 20 per cent. by 2022 in the United States.
Refineries
Neste Oil has two renewable diesel refineries in Singapore and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Neste Oil has invested heavily in renewable diesel production capacity based on its proprietary NEXBTL technology and now operates the world's two largest renewable diesel refineries, in Singapore and in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Both of these facilities have a capacity of 800,000 tonnes of NEXBTL renewable diesel per annum. Neste Oil also produces renewable diesel in two NEXBTL units at the Porvoo refinery.
In total, Neste Oil has a renewable diesel production capacity of 2 million tonnes per annum, making it the world's largest producer in the field according to the estimates of Neste Oil's management. The renewable diesel refineries in Singapore, Rotterdam, and Porvoo achieved capacity utilisation of 102 per cent. in 2014 (2013: 91 per cent) and total renewable fuels output was 2.3 million tonnes (2013: 2.0 million tonnes).
Oil Retail
Oil Retail has a network of 1,030 stations around the Baltic and serves as a key marketing channel for Neste Oil's premium-quality, low-emission products. Oil Retail's product range includes gasoline, diesel, heating oil, heavy fuel oil, and aviation fuel. In addition, Neste Oil offers its customers a wide range of lubricants, as well as chemicals and LPG. Oil Retail's goal is to maximise the cash flow generated by product sales and leverage the growth potential offered by its markets.
Oil Retail markets and sells fuels and lubricants that offer premium quality combined with a small environmental footprint. The product range includes gasoline, diesel, heating oil, heavy fuel oil, and aviation fuel. In addition, Neste Oil offers its customers a wide range of lubricants, as well as chemicals and LPG.
Neste Oil is a major petroleum products marketing company around the Baltic, with stations not only in Finland, but also in Northwest Russia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Neste Oil's goal is to be one of the two largest service station chains in all its selected market areas - based on high-quality products, a strong brand, an extensive station network, and competitive unit costs. As at 31 December 2014, Neste Oil had a total of 1,030 stations, of which 803 are located in Finland and 227 in Northwest Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Neste Oil aims to be one of the top two service station chains in its selected markets.
Research, Technology and Engineering
Neste Oil committed itself to adopting advanced technologies many years ago and has a long track record in developing lower-emissions traffic fuels. Neste Oil was the first company to offer unleaded and sulphur-free fuels, as well as biofuels, on the Finnish market. Today, Neste Oil produces the world's cleanest diesel fuel from renewables and is researching a range of new raw materials. Neste Oil's engineering expertise is also world-class.
The dynamism of Neste Oil's research and technology activities is based on in-depth know-how, close cooperation between the best people in their fields, and successful partnerships with research institutions and companies. Research and technology operations are based at Porvoo, where close to 1,000 people are employed in work related to research and development and engineering. Having the Porvoo refinery, the technology centre and its laboratories, and engineering

expert, Neste Jacobs, close to each other helps promote collaborative work and creates an innovative environment for world-class research and development.

In 2014, broadening both the renewable and fossil feedstock base was a key research topic at Neste Oil. In addition, exploring growth opportunities beyond the current product portfolio, even beyond traffic fuels, has become a new growing area of interest for the Company. In 2014, the new product launches comprised a low sulphur marine fuel and the high quality futura branded fuels in the Baltic countries and Russia. Efficiency improvements at the Com pany's oil refineries and renewable refineries continued as a key focus area o f technology development. Neste O il's research and development expenditure totalled EUR 40 million in 2014 (2013: EUR 40 million). As in the previous years, majority of the research and development expenditure was devoted to feedstock research. In 2014, the waste and residue based feedstock increased by more than 30 per cent. to 1.6 million tonnes (2013: 1.2 million tonnes) and accounted for 62 per cent. (2013: 52 per cent.) of the total NEXBTL feed. At the same time, the overall NEXBTL production volume increased to 2.1 million tonnes (2013: 1.9 million tonnes). Especially quantities o f lower grade waste and residue feedstock, e.g., used cooking oil and low quality animal fat, increased.

Legal Proceedings
The Finnish Customs has levied a penalty payment totalling approximately EUR 44 million on Neste Oil because they consider that Finnish biofuel mandate requirements were not met by Neste Oil in 2009 and 2010. Biofuel mandate legislation requires that companies distributing liquid fuels must provide appropriate energy content specified for biofuels in the fuel that they supply for customer use. The legislation in question is intended to increase the use of biofuels and, thereby, reduce emissions. Neste Oil has supplied the amount of biofuels required by the legislation in 2009 and 2010. Neste Oil disputes the Finnish Customs' interpretation and believes that it complied with the requirements in accordance with the legislation in force at the time. The disagreement between Neste Oil and the Finnish Customs concerns the interpretation of the legislation on biofuel mandate. Neste Oil has appealed the Finnish Customs' decision and considers the penalty payment unjustified. The penalty payment was paid by Neste Oil in January 2014 when it impacted the Com pany's cash flow. The payment is presented in long term receivable in the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 2014.
In March 2014, Neste Oil received a U.S. customs ruling regarding the classification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule for the code and corresponding duty rate for a certain product that Neste Oil imported into a foreign country, including prior entries from the years 2009-2014. This classification was different than the one utilised by Neste Oil and had a higher duty rate, which could have had an effect on some of the import entries dependent upon any Free Trade Agreement between the countries. Neste Oil disputes the classification ruling and believes that the classification originally utilised was appropriate considering the product's chemical composition and the applicable explanatory notes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Neste Oil has filed an appeal against such classification ruling seeking to align it with those of other global jurisdictions. If the classification ruling is ultimately upheld, Neste Oil could be required to pay additional duties with an estimated impact of EUR 9 million, which has not been reported as a provision in the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Expect as set forth above, Neste Oil and its subsidiaries have no pending governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any proceedings that are pending or threatened of which Neste Oil is aware) that may have, or have had in the past 12 months a significant effect on the financial position or profitability o f Neste Oil and its subsidiaries, as a whole, nor is Neste Oil aware of any such proceedings being threatened.

Employees

As at 31 December 2014, Neste Oil had 4,833 employees, of which 1,524 were based outside o f Finland. Neste Oil had 5,049 employees as at 31 December 2013. Neste Oil believes that its labour relations with personnel are good.

Material Contracts

There are no contracts (other than contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business) that have been entered into by Neste Oil or its subsidiaries during the two years immediately preceding the date of this Prospectus, which are, or may be, material or which contain any provision under which Neste Oil or its subsidiaries have any obligation or entitlement, which is material to Neste Oil or its subsidiaries as at the date of this Prospectus.

Insurance

Many of Neste Oil's business activities are characterised by substantial investments in complex production facilities, manufacturing and transportation equipment. Many of the production processes, raw materials and certain finished products are potentially destructive and dangerous in uncontrolled or catastrophic circumstances, including fires, explosions, accidents, major equipment failures, etc. In addition, Neste O il's transportation o f crude oil, other feedstocks and refined petroleum products is exposed to potential vessel collisions, especially in the G ulf o f Finland due to the large volume of intersecting marine traffic.

In addition to preventive risk management measures, Neste Oil maintains insurance against major hazard risks in accordance with customary industry practices. Hazard risk is defined as the risk of financial losses arising from events leading to the damage of physical or intellectual assets, business interruption, personnel injuries, or environmental, product, or other liabilities.

The State (acting through the Prime Minister's Office) holds 50.1 per cent. of the shares and voting rights in Neste Oil and thus controls it. The State exercises its ownership according to the State Shareholdings and Ownership Steering Act (1368/2007, as amended) (the "Ownership Steering Act"). According to the Ownership Steering Act, Neste Oil is a "state majority-owned company". This means, among others, that consent of the Parliament would be required for relinquishing the State's majority ownership in Neste Oil.
In the Government Resolution on State Ownership Policy dated 3 November 2011 (the "Resolution") certain state majority owned companies, including Neste Oil, are considered to be companies in which the State has strategic interests relating to, for example, the security of supply, the maintenance and protection of the infrastructure and national defence.
Pursuant to the Resolution, as a state majority-owned company operating on a commercial basis in a competitive environment, Neste Oil has to operate on the same terms as its competitors and in a manner that its ownership arrangement does not distort competition. In accordance with this policy of competitive neutrality set forth in the Resolution, the operating principles, financial structure and return targets of state-majority owned companies operating on a commercial basis must be comparable with those of other companies engaged in the same field of activity. Even so,

56

such companies are required to give due consideration to the justified expectations arising from state ownership regarding responsible operations in compliance with the principles of sustainability. According to the Resolution, strategic state interests may also extend to commercial companies operating in markets open to competition. More specifically, such strategic interests relate to the security of supply, the maintenance and protection of the infrastructure, and national defence. Additionally, while the companies may have obligations to provide certain basic services, they must clearly follow generally accepted business practices. With such companies, the goal of ownership steering is to achieve the best possible overall financial result at any given time. This is evaluated in terms of profitability and long-term growth in shareholder value. When ownership is evaluated, due consideration is given to the cost effects arising from the State's strategic interests and the maintenance of the level of control required to safeguard such interests.

FINNISH TAXATION
The following summary is based on the tax laws o f Finland as in effect on the date o f this Prospectus, and is subject to changes in Finnish law, including changes that could have a retroactive effect. The following summary is not exhaustive and does not take into account or discuss the tax laws o f any country other than Finland. Prospective investors are advised to consult their own professional tax advisors as to the tax consequences relating to investment in the Notes. Listed Notes are not subject to Finnish transfer tax (Varainsiirtoverolaki 931/1996, as amended).
Individuals
If the recipient of interest paid on the Notes is an individual (natural person) residing in Finland or an undistributed estate of a deceased Finnish resident, such interest is, when paid by the Issuer or securities dealer (i.e., a Finnish financial institution making the payment), subject to an advance withholding tax in accordance with the Finnish Withholding Tax Act (Ennakkoperintalaki 1118/1996, as amended) and final taxation as capital income in accordance with the Finnish Income Tax Act (Tuloverolaki 1535/1992, as amended). The current withholding tax and capital income tax rate is 30 per cent. Should the amount of capital income received by a resident natural person exceed EUR 30,000 in a calendar year, the capital income tax rate is 33 per cent. on the amount that exceeds the EUR 30,000 threshold. However, advance tax withholdings will still be made at the rate of 30 per cent.
I f Notes are disposed o f during the loan period, any capital gain as well as accrued interest received (secondary market compensation) is taxed as capital income. The Issuer or a securities dealer (i.e., a Finnish financial institution making the payment) must deduct an advance withholding tax from the secondary market compensation paid to an individual (natural person) residing in Finland or an undistributed estate of a deceased Finnish resident.
An individual (natural person) residing in Finland or an undistributed estate o f a deceased Finnish resident may deduct eventual capital losses from its taxable capital gains in the year of disposal and in the five subsequent calendar years.
I f Notes are acquired in the secondary market, any accrued interest paid (secondary market compensation) is deductible from the capital income or, to the extent exceeding capital income, from earned income subject to the limitations o f the Finnish Income Tax Act.
Corporate Entity or Partnership
Interest paid to Finnish corporate entities (other than non-profit associations) and to Finnish partnerships is deemed to be taxable income o f the recipient o f interest. Any gain or loss realised following a disposal o f the Notes will be taxable income or a tax deductible loss for the relevant Noteholder. The current tax rate for corporate entities is 20 per cent. Interest paid to such Noteholders is not subject to any withholding tax.
Non-Finnish Resident Noteholders
Noteholders who are not resident in Finland for tax purposes and who do not engage in trade or business through a permanent establishment or a fixed place o f business in Finland will not be subject to Finnish taxes on interest or gains realised on the sale or redemption of the Notes. Interest payments made by the Issuer or a securities dealer (i.e., a Finnish financial institution making the payment) to Noteholders who are not resident in Finland for tax purposes may, however, be subject to Finnish withholding tax, unless the identity of the Noteholders can be appropriately established.
EU Savings Tax Directive
Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, each EU member state is required to provide to the tax authorities of another EU member state details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types o f entity established in that other EU member state; however, for a transitional period, Austria may instead apply a withholding system in relation to such payments, deducting tax at rates rising over time to 35 per cent. The transitional period is to terminate at the end o f the first full fiscal year following agreement by certain non-EU countries to the exchange of information relating to such payments.
A number of non-EU countries, including Switzerland, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino, and certain dependent or associated territories o f certain EU member states, have adopted similar measures (either provision o f information or transitional withholding) in relation to payments made by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entity established in a EU member state. In addition, the EU member states have entered into provision of information or transitional withholding arrangements with certain of those dependent or associated territories in relation to payments made by a person in a EU member state to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types o f entity established in one o f those territories.
58

The Council of the European Union formally adopted a Council Directive amending the Directive on 24 March 2014 (the "Amending Directive"). The Amending Directive broadens the scope of the requirements described above. EU member states have until 1 January 2016 to adopt the national legislation necessary to comply with the Amending Directive. The changes made under the Amending Directive include extending the scope of the Directive to payments made to, or collected for, certain other entities and legal arrangements. They also broaden the definition of "interest payment" to cover income that is equivalent to interest. Investors who are in any doubt as to their position should consult their professional advisers.
