1. BACKGROUND

The Issuer has been engaged in negotiations with certain Bondholders over the amendments of the Terms and Conditions. As a result of such negotiations, the Issuer and such Bondholders (who hold a passing majority needed to approve the discussed amendments on behalf of the Bondholders) have signed a term sheet on the draft amendments. However, since the negotiations involving the final amended terms and conditions of the Bonds are not expected to be completed by 30 November 2016 (i.e., the next Interest Payment Date), the Issuer is required to request a waiver in respect o f payment of Interest falling due for payment on the next Interest Payment Date.

2. REQUEST FOR WAIVER

The Issuer hereby requests the Bondholders to waive the obligation to pay the accrued Interest pursuant to Clause 9(b) of the Terms and Conditions until and including 14 December 2016. Unless otherwise agreed in the final amended terms and conditions of the Bonds (a proposal for which amended terms and conditions the Issuer contemplates to send for approval of the Bondholders in a
