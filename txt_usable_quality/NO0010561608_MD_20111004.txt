To the bondholders in: ISIN NO 001056160.8 - 9.00 per cent Marine Subsea Cyprus Holding Ltd Bond Issue 2009/2019 (the "Bondholders")
Oslo, 4 October 2011
AMENDMENT OF THE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO FOLLOWING THE BONDHOLDERS' MEETING RESOLUTION 31 AUGUST 2011
Marine Subsea Cyprus Holding Ltd. is the issuer and borrower ("MSCH" or the "Borrower") under that certain Loan Agreement, dated 14 December 2009, (the "Bond Loan Agreement") between MSCH, Marine Subsea AS, as parent guarantor (the "Parent", and together with MSCH and the other Obligors under the Bond Loan Agreement, the "Company") and Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") as Trustee, pursuant to which MSCH issued the above-referenced bonds with ISIN NO 001056160.8, in the original principal amount of USD 246,000,000 (the "Bonds").
Reference is made to the summons to Bondholders' meeting for the Bonds dated 23 August 2011 (the "Summons"), and the resolution which was passed at the Bondholders' meeting held on 31 August 2011 (the "Meeting"). All capitalised terms used herein that are not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Bond Loan Agreement or the Summons unless otherwise stated.
At the Meeting, 79.15 % of the Bonds were represented, either in person or by proxy. Of the Bonds represented in the Meeting, 83.63 % voted in favour of the proposed resolution which inter alia included an authorization and direction in favour of NTM to enter into the Agreement. The Agreement set out the terms of a proposed restructuring relating to the Bonds and further provided that the restructuring should be consummated on or before the Long Stop Date, which was defined in the Agreement as 30 September 2011.
The restructuring was not consummated prior to 30 September 2011, and the Agreement may now be terminated by NTM. The Borrower has approached NTM with a request to agree an extension to the Long Stop Date. It is AMA Capital Partners LLC's ("AMA") evaluation that it is in the best interest o f the Bondholders:
(i) for the Long Stop Date to be extended to 31 October 2011 to allow the Borrower additional time to satisfy the conditions precedent referred to in the Agreement, so as to allow the restructuring to be consummated; and
(ii) if the restructuring has not been consummated by 31 October 2011, but NTM and AMA believe there is a reasonable prospect that the restructuring will be consummated on or before 30 November 2011 and it is in the Bondholders'

interests to further extend the Long Stop Date, the Long Stop Date should be further extended to 30 November 2011. AMA has contacted Bondholders that they are aware of and understands that this group holds approximately 60 % o f the Bonds (based on holdings information provided to Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP). None o f the Bondholders that AMA has been in contact with has objected to the extension o f the Longstop Date to 31 October 2011 (or 30 November 2011, on the terms set out above). Decision and Bondholder's right to protest NTM hereby informs the Bondholders that it intends to agree to amend the Agreement by extending the Long Stop Date to 31 October 2011 or 30 November 2011 (on the terms set out above) (the "A m endm ent"). In light o f AM A's evaluation, feedback from Bondholders, and the voting result in the Meeting, NTM is o f the opinion that it is in the best interests o f the Bondholders to make the Amendment. However, NTM may not agree to the Amendment if any Bondholder submits a written protest within 5 Banking Days o f the date o f this notice. Such protest must be in writing and dispatched at the latest 12 October 2011 by either e-mail to post@trustee.no or by fax to +47 22 87 94 10.
