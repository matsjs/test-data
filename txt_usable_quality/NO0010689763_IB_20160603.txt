having its registered office at Insolvency Support Services Limited, H5 Newark Business Park,

and filed at the Court on 6 January 2016 (the "Administration Appointment"). The

Administrators were appointed by the directors of the Company via the out of court route

pursuant to paragraph 22 of Schedule B1 of the Act. Since 6 January 2016, the Company has

been administered under the control and supervision of the Administrators.

1.2

This document is divided into the following sections:

1.2.1 Part I - Executive Summary: overview of the CVA and the Nominees' recommendations;

1.2.2 Part II - Background: including Company information, details of the events leading up to the Administration Appointment and this CVA Proposal, and creditor actions required; and

1.2.3 Part III - Terms of the Company Voluntary Arrangement: details of the Nominees' proposals for the CVA which will enable the Company's liabilities to the Fund Creditors and the Group Companies to be compromised in order to implement a sale of the Shares.

The Administrators' statement of proposals for the Company pursuant to paragraph 49 of

Schedule B1 of the Act was sent to all creditors of the Company on 9 February 2016. On 23

February 2016, the Administrators' statement of proposals was deemed to have been approved

1.4

One of the proposals in the Administrators' statement of proposals was to implement a CVA in

PART I - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

3.

OVERVIEW OF EVENTS LEADING TO ADMINISTRATION AND THE COMPANY

VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT

3.1

The Company is the holder of a number of licences to extract oil and gas from the UK sector of

the North Sea.

3.2

Huntington was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. However, as part of the

preparatory steps for the CVA, the Company's 100% shareholding in Huntington was

transferred to Devco. Huntington has a working interest in the Huntington Licence.

3.3

Operational difficulties with the Huntington Licence, a delay in the projected first oil date for

Orlando and the significant drop in oil and gas prices led to the Company experiencing financial

difficulties in late 2014 and during 2015.

3.4

The Company, with support of the Bondholders, sought to implement a financial restructuring

of the Group Companies, which was ultimately unsuccessful.

3.5

The Company then entered into an Accelerated Merger & Acquisition process (the "M&A

Process") for the shares in and/or all of the assets of each of the Company and Huntington.

3.6

As sufficient progress could not be made in relation to the M&A Process in respect of Orlando

and Kells and, against the backdrop of the Company's financial position, the decision was taken

by Management to place the Company and Huntington into administration.

3.7

The protection which an administration gave the Company was a prime factor in the decision to

proceed with placing it into administration. Under an administration, there is statutory

protection from legal proceedings being commenced or continued against the Company, no

steps can be taken to enforce security and no order can be made for the winding up of the

Company.

3.8

The Administrators have determined that it is in the best interests of the unsecured creditors of

the Company that the sale of the Shares is implemented in conjunction with a CVA because the

CVA will result in a dividend for each of the Approved Creditors and there would be no value

for unsecured creditors otherwise. The CVA will also enable the Orlando and Kells

developments to continue, which may result in further opportunities for certain creditors. The

sale of the Shares could not be completed without a CVA. The Purchaser is willing to contribute

funding for the CVA, which will be used to establish the Fund from which a dividend will be

paid to each of the Approved Creditors if the CVA is approved and Completion occurs. The

costs of the CVA (including the Nominees' and Supervisors' fees) will be met by the Bond

Trustee from the proceeds payable to the Bond Trustee from Huntington during its

administration.

3.9

The dividend paid to each of the Approved Creditors through the CVA is estimated to be

between 4 - 6 pence in the pound. However, there would be no dividend available for the

Company's unsecured creditors in an administration or as a result of the dissolution of the

Company.

4.

OVERVIEW OF COMPANY VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT PROCEDURE

4.1

A CVA is a formal insolvency procedure under Part 1 of the Act, which enables a company to

agree with its creditors a scheme which determines how creditors' claims against the company

should be paid and in what proportions.

UK - 210464869.22

7

4.2

To implement a CVA, approval is required from a majority in excess of 75% in value of

creditors present and voting, either in person or by proxy, on the CVA proposals at the meeting

of the creditors.

4.3

Under Rule 1.16A(3) of the Rules, there is to be left out of account a creditor's vote in respect

of any claim or part of a claim:

4.3.1 where written notice of claim was not given, either at the meeting or before it, to the chairman or the nominees;

4.3.2 where the claim or part is secured (for the avoidance of doubt the Bond Trustee, Junior Creditor and Huntington will be voting at the Creditors' Meeting in respect of the unsecured element of their claims against the Company);

4.3.3 where the claim is in respect of a debt wholly or partly on, or secured by, a current bill of exchange or promissory note, unless the creditor is willing:

(a)

to treat the liability to the creditor on the bill or note of every person who is

liable on it antecedently to the company, and who has not been made

bankrupt or had their estate sequestrated (or in the case of a company, which

has not gone into liquidation), as a security in the creditor's hands; and

(b)

to estimate the value of the security and (for the purpose of entitlement to

vote, but not of any distribution under the arrangement) to deduct it from the

creditor's claim.

To the best of the Nominees knowledge, the Company has no debt secured by a current bill of exchange or promissory note.

4.4

Under Rule 1.16A(4) of the Rules, a resolution approving the CVA will be invalid if those

creditors voting against it include more than half in value of the creditors of the company, for

these purposes counting only those creditors:

4.4.1 to whom notice of the meeting was sent;

4.4.2 whose votes were not left out of account due to no notice of claim having been received by the nominees; and

4.4.3 who are not, to the best of the chairman's belief, persons connected with the company pursuant to sections 249 and 435 of the Act.

4.5

Any creditor entitled to vote at the meeting of the company's creditors may apply to court

pursuant to sections 6(3)(a) and 6(3)(b) of the Act if they believe the CVA unfairly prejudices

the interests of creditors or there has been a material irregularity at or in relation to the meeting

of creditors.

4.6

Any such application referred to in clause 4.5 must be made by the creditor within a period of

28 days beginning on the day on which the chairman of the creditors' meeting reports the result

of the creditors' meeting to the court or, if the creditor was not given notice of the creditors'

meeting, such application must be made within a period of 28 days beginning on the day on

which the creditor became aware that the creditors' meeting had taken place.

4.7

The company's shareholders can approve the CVA proposals by a majority in excess o f 50% in

value present in person or by proxy at the meeting of members, but if the shareholders do not

approve the CVA proposals while the creditors do, the CVA will still be implemented.

UK - 210464869.22

8

4.8

If a CVA is approved, all creditors of the company, including those creditors that were entitled

to vote at the creditors' meeting or who would have been entitled to vote had they received

notice of the meeting, will be bound by the terms of the CVA.

4.9

This CVA Proposal outlines the proposals for a CVA of the Company, giving the details

required under the Act and the Rules and setting out the basis on which it is intended the CVA

should be conducted.

7.1

The Company was incorporated on 14 December 2007 under the name Golfdee Limited. The

company changed its name to Iona Energy Company (UK) Limited on 18 December 2007. On

18 March 2014, the Company became a public limited company. On the 27 May 2016 the

Company was registered as a private limited company.

7.2

The directors of the Company as recorded in its statutory books as at the Operative Date are Iain

Charles McKendrick and Thomas Hamilton Reynolds.

7.3

The secretary of the Company as recorded in its statutory books as at the Operative Date is

Burness Pauli LLP.

7.4

Pursuant to the Shares Pledge, the shareholder of the Company as shown in its register of

members as at the Operative Date is the Bond Trustee, who holds 50,001 ordinary shares of

GBP £1.00 each.

Background and events leading up to the Administrators' appointment

7.5

As at the Operative Date, the Company held the following licences to extract oil and gas from

the UK sector of the North Sea:

7.5.1 a 20% working interest in Trent & Tyne (Licences P.609, P.685 and P.2114);

7.5.2 a 75% working interest in Orlando (Licence P. 1606);

7.5.3 a 75% working interest in Kells (Licence P. 1607);

7.5.4 a 100% working interest in Ronan & Oran (Licence P.1971);

7.5.5 a 58.73016% working interest in West Wick (Licence P.185);

7.5.6 a 100% working interest in Fleetwind (Licence P.1801); and

7.5.7 a 33.33% working interest in Fame & Lundy (Licence P.2107).

7.6

The Company's profitability was impacted by a delay in the projected first oil date for Orlando,

and a global reduction in oil and gas prices at the end of 2014 and during 2015. The table at

Schedule 2 summarises the recent financial performance of the Company and Huntington.

7.7

In September 2013, the Company issued the Bonds to the Bondholders pursuant to the Bond

Agreement. The Bonds are secured by the Bond Security. The Company also entered into

certain amendments in relation to derivative contracts with, and granted the Junior Security to,

the Junior Creditor.

7.8

On 18 December 2014, the Parent issued a press release stating that it was likely that financial

covenants contained within the Bond Agreement would be breached during the following

twelve months, as a result of the challenges described at clause 7.6.

7.9

During early 2015, discussions commenced with the largest Bondholders and an ad hoc

committee of Bondholders was formed (the "Bondholder Committee"). FTI was retained as

financial advisor to the Bondholder Committee, and this engagement was subsequently novated

to the Bond Trustee.

7.10 On 27 March 2015, the Company obtained approval of the Bondholders to covenant relief and a deferral of the payment of cash interest on the Bonds until first oil on Orlando, along with

U K -210464869.22

12

certain other amendments to the terms of the Bond Agreement, in exchange for which the Group Companies agreed to provide an acceptable proposal in order to refinance the Bonds and/or obtain funding in order to enable first oil on Orlando to be reached (a "Restructuring Proposal").
7.11 During the subsequent months, the Group Companies worked to develop a Restructuring Proposal, which was based on the development of Orlando in order to reach first oil. This work involved an extensive search for potential debt and/or equity investors in Orlando or the business as a whole, as well as the disposal of the Group Companies' non-core assets. This led to a presentation to Bondholders of a Restructuring Proposal on 30 July 2015.
7.12 On 6 August 2015, the Bondholders approved the Restructuring Proposal presented to them on 30 July 2015. The Restructuring Proposal included a farm out of 25% from the Company's 75% interest in Orlando (the "Orlando Farm Out").
7.13 On 3 August 2015, Atlantic, the Company's joint venture partner in Orlando, issued a statement indicating that it did not have sufficient funding in place to fully meet its 25% share of development costs for Orlando and that it was engaged in efforts to secure a solution. As a result, Management undertook additional efforts to obtain funding for Atlantic's share of Orlando development costs as a precautionary measure in the event that Atlantic was unable to raise sufficient funding.
7.14 On 18 November 2015, the Parent announced that the Restructuring Proposal would not proceed. This was because the parent company of the Orlando Farm Out counterparty, a global energy company, had elected to restrict capital allocation to its upstream operations and therefore a key component of the Restructuring Proposal could not be completed. The Parent's announcement stated that it was likely that the Company would need to be placed into an insolvency process to protect the interests of all stakeholders to the Company.
7.15 Since 18 November 2015, and following consultation with the Bondholder Committee, the Bond Trustee, FTI and Management have run the M&A Process in order to try to sell the assets and/or shares in the Company and Huntington. In parallel with this, contingency planning was undertaken for the potential administration of the Company.
7.16 Ultimately, owing to the progress of the M&A Process and other considerations, the decision was taken by the directors of the Company to place the Company into administration.
M&A Process and events leading up to CVA Proposal
7.17 As part of the M&A Process, prospective purchasers were asked to bid on any or all of the following:
7.17.1 the shares in or assets of Huntington;
7.17.2 the Company's licence interests, principally in Orlando, Kells, Trent & Tyne, West Wick, and Ronan and Oran; and
7.17.3 the Shares.
7.18 Management prepared a summary of the Company's and Huntington's business and assets which was distributed to 42 prospective purchasers on 23 November 2015, who were given an initial target date of 4 December 2015 for the submission of their bids, which was later extended for certain assets.
7.19 Details of the interest received and the status of each asset of the Company are provided below at clauses 7.20 to 7.23.

U K -210464869.22

13

7.20 Trent & Tyne (Licences P.609, P.685 and P.2114)

7.20.1

The Company's interest in Trent & Tyne was deemed to have no or negative value to the Company. Accordingly, the strategy was to divest the licences to, and agree a consensual settlement of all outstanding claims and counter claims with, the Company's joint operating partner in respect of Trent & Tyne, Perenco UK Limited. The consideration for this transaction comprised a consensual settlement and nil cash consideration.

7.20.2

The Administrators supported this transaction given there was no realistic prospect of an alternative sale for greater value, and because it would affect the Company's release from a number of actual and potential liabilities in respect of the licences.

7.20.3

The Administrators considered this transaction, which completed on 24 February 2016, to constitute a "pre-packaged sale" and as such made the necessary disclosure in accordance with SIP16 that was sent to all creditors of the Company on 14 January 2016. Creditors who would like to receive a further copy of the Administrators' SIP16 disclosure in respect of this transaction should contact the Administrators at William.Marsden@fticonsulting.com or on +44(0)203 727 1342.

7.21 West Wick (Licence P.185)

7.21.1

On 3 February 2016 the Administrators signed a sale and purchase agreement in respect of the Company's interest in West Wick for USD $1.8 million with Chevron. The consideration from the transaction is deferred and contingent as it is linked to the approval of a field development plan by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (the "Secretary of State").

7.21.2

Whilst the sale and purchase agreement was executed approximately four weeks following the appointment of the Administrators and the sale has not yet completed, the Administrators considered the transaction to constitute a "pre packaged sale" given the sale was subject to pre-appointment negotiation with Chevron and Chevron's due diligence continued after the appointment of Administrators.

7.21.3

The Administrators' SIP16 disclosure in respect of this transaction was included with the Administrators' Statement of Proposals dated 9 February 2016. Creditors who would like to receive a further copy of the Administrators' SIP16 disclosure in respect of this transaction should contact the Administrators at William.Marsden@fticonsulting.com or o n +44(0)203 727 1342.

7.22 Ronan & Oran (Licence P.1971), Fleetwind (Licence P.1801) and Fame & Lundy (Licence P.2107)

7.22.1 Ronan & Oran, Fleetwind and Fame & Lundy generated no interest during the M&A Process.

7.22.2 Ronan & Oran was relinquished to the Secretary of State on 31 December 2015.

7.22.3 Fleetwind was relinquished to the Secretary of State on 10 January 2016.

7.22.4 The Company issued withdrawal notices to Parkmead (E&P) Limited, the operator of Fame and Lundy, on 17 December 2016. The Company received

U K -210464869.22

14

notification from the OGA on 18 April 2016 that Parkmead (E&P) Limited had submitted a notice of relinquishment to the Secretary of State.

7.23 Orlando (Licence P.1606) and Kells (Licence P.1607)

7.23.1

The Administrators received several expressions of interest in respect of a sale of Orlando and Kells. In all cases, interested parties intended to structure such an acquisition via a purchase of the Shares following a successful CVA of the Company.

7.23.2

However, the offers that were received were either not considered to be capable of delivery or represented a lower return to the Company's creditors than the Purchaser's offer.

7.23.3 The Purchaser's offer represented the best recovery for the Senior Creditor and an enhanced recovery for the Fund Creditors relative to all other options.

7.24 Following the marketing process described at clause 7.18, the Purchaser submitted a proposal to the Administrators for the purchase of the Shares.

7.25 Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser has agreed to acquire the Shares for the Consideration on Completion. The Contribution will be separately provided to the Company by the Purchaser under the terms of the Purchase Agreement to establish the Fund to enable the Company to propose the CVA and, if the CVA is approved by the Company's creditors and Completion occurs, to pay a dividend to each of the Approved Creditors.

7.26 Given the lack of Company assets available to make a distribution to the Company's creditors in any form of insolvency process without the CVA, the Administrators are of the opinion that the sale of the Shares and the CVA would be more beneficial to the creditors of the Company than any other form of insolvency process. Further information, including a comparison with dissolution, can be found in clause 18 and Schedule 3.

8.

ASSETS TRANSFERRED FROM THE COMPANY

8.1

In order to deal with certain of the Company's assets which were excluded from the offer made

by the Purchaser, it has been necessary to take certain internal reorganisation steps. These are

disclosed below for transparency to creditors.

8.2

The following assets (previously owned by the Company) were transferred by the Company

prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement;

8.2.1 the shares in Huntington have been transferred by the Company to Devco; and

8.2.2 following consultation with the Bond Trustee, the Company's right to bring certain potential recovery actions against third parties (the "Recovery Actions") has been transferred to Huntington in order to preserve the Administrators' rights to pursue the Recovery Actions in the future (if appropriate).

8.3

As further detailed in clause 7.21.1, West Wick has been sold to Chevron but this sale has not

completed and the consideration has not yet been paid. The Company will transfer West Wick

to Chevron in due course, following approval of the transaction from the Secretary of State on 9

May 2016. The Company, the Administrators and the Bond Trustee have entered into an

agreement (the "West Wick Assignment") assigning the consideration payable in respect of

West Wick from the Company to the Bond Trustee, along with all legal and equitable rights,

UK - 210464869.22

15

causes of action, claims and remedies in relation to that consideration (the "West Wick Actions"). The West Wick Assignment will take effect on Completion.

8.4

The transfers of the Transferred Assets are not detrimental to the CVA Creditors because:

8.4.1 all assets (other than the Recovery Actions and West Wick) are pledged to the Senior Creditor and the Junior Creditor pursuant to the Bond Security and the Junior Security respectively;

8.4.2 the value of the Recovery Actions, if any, is highly uncertain. Any action would require funding of forensic review and legal work and the costs may be significant. Furthermore, any Recovery Actions may ultimately be unsuccessful. Even if a Recovery Action were to be successful, given the number of, and amount owing to, the CVA Creditors, the net return to Approved Creditors may be minimal and lower than their expected dividend from the Fund; and

8.4.3 any payments from either the sale of West Wick or the West Wick Recoveries would not result in a Prescribed Part being made available for unsecured creditors of the Company. All funds from West Wick would be payable to the Bond Trustee, as a result of its rights under the West Wick Assignment and the existing intercreditor and security deed dated 30 September 2013. Therefore assigning the potential recoveries from the West Wick Actions in advance of actual recovery and the consideration for the sale of West Wick does not impact the unsecured creditors.

9.

DIRECTORS' STATEMENT OF AFFAIRS

9.1

The directors of the Company have prepared a Statement of Affairs as at the Operative Date,

together with a list of all of the creditors of the Company and the amount of their respective

claims against the Company. The Statement of Affairs is attached at Schedule 1 as required in

accordance with Rule 1.11(2)(b) of the Rules.

9.2

The Company's assets, valued on an estimated to realise basis but excluding goodwill, are as set

out in the directors' Statement of Affairs at Schedule 1.

9.3

As at the date of Completion, none of the Company's assets are subject to any security in favour

of any creditors other than the Senior Creditor and the Junior Creditor. Details of the security

held by the Senior Creditor and the Junior Creditor can be found at Schedule 5. The Bond

Security and Junior Security will be released upon, and as part of, Completion (but shall not be

affected in any other way by the terms of this CVA).

PART III - TERMS OF THE COMPANY VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT

10. INTRODUCTION

10.1 No prospective purchaser was willing to buy the Shares without first implementing a CVA of the Company because of the Company's outstanding debts and the fact that the Company is in administration. By proposing a CVA, the Administrators may propose a compromise of certain of the Company's liabilities, thus making a sale of the Shares viable. Each of the Approved Creditors will receive a dividend from the Fund. However, without a CVA the Administrators believe that it would not be possible to sell the Shares or pay a dividend to unsecured creditors.

10.2 The purposes of the CVA are as follows:

10.2.1 to compromise the Company's liabilities to the Fund Creditors and the Group Companies to facilitate a sale of the Shares to the Purchaser; and

10.2.2

to pay each of the Approved Creditors a dividend out of the Fund pro rata to their Approved Claim in exchange for the full and final settlement of their claims against the Company.

10.3 The Fund would not be available in a dissolution or administration of the Company without the CVA. Given the lack of returns for unsecured creditors of the Company by any other means, it is therefore the Nominees' opinion that the CVA represents the best option for the Company's unsecured creditors.

10.4 If the CVA is not approved there will not be sufficient funds to repay the Junior Creditor and Senior Creditor in full, therefore the only potential returns to unsecured creditors of the Company would relate to the Prescribed Part only. However, the Administrators do not anticipate that there will be sufficient funds for a Prescribed Part to enable a payment to unsecured creditors. If the CVA is not approved, the Administrators will file a notice for dissolution of the Company pursuant to paragraph 84 of Schedule B1 of the Act. A comparison of estimated outcomes for CVA Creditors in the CVA and dissolution is contained in Schedule 3.

10.5 Pursuant to the notice served by the Bond Trustee on the Parent dated 27 May 2016, the Bond Trustee is entitled to exercise all voting rights in relation to the Shares.

10.6 If the CVA is approved by the CVA Creditors, the Supervisors will be responsible for (i) the implementation of the CVA, (ii) receiving the Contribution, (iii) adjudicating and agreeing the Fund Creditors' claims, and, if Completion occurs, (iv) paying dividends to each of the Approved Creditors out of the Fund.

10.7 Only Fund Creditors are entitled to have their claims against the Company adjudicated by the Supervisors in accordance with clause 21 and if their claims are Approved Claims, receive dividends from the Fund.

10.8 All liabilities owed by the Company to the Fund Creditors and the Group Companies will be compromised by the CVA in accordance with clause 21.5. Despite a legal entitlement, the Senior Creditor, Junior Creditor and Group Companies have elected not to participate in the Fund (and are therefore not Fund Creditors) in order to improve the return for the Approved Creditors. Aside from the Approved Creditors, none of the Fund Creditors, the Senior Creditor, the Junior Creditor, or the Group Companies will be entitled to any dividend from the Fund in relation to liabilities owed to them by the Company.

UK - 210464869.22

17

10.9 10.10
10.11 10.12

From the Effective Date, the Terminating Contracts shall be terminated and the NonTerminating Contracts will remain in force, in accordance with clause 16.
The current directors of the Company intend to resign on Completion. The Purchaser will appoint its own directors as directors of the Company. The Purchaser has no previous connection to current directors or key employees of the Company.
The CVA will complete in accordance with clause 25.
A summary of the key dates and timeline of the CVA is set out at clause 5.

11.

THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND COMPLETION

11.1 The CVA is being proposed to facilitate the sale of the Shares to the Purchaser. The sale of the Shares to the Purchaser will be effected pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. Completion is contingent on, amongst other matters, the approval of the CVA at the Creditors' Meeting.

11.2 Upon Completion:

11.2.1 The Purchaser will lend the Contribution to the Company. The Contribution will constitute the Fund.

11.2.2

In exchange for the Consideration, the Purchaser will acquire the Shares, subject to the Bond Debt. Given the extent of the Company's liabilities, the Administrators have determined that the Shares have no value. The Shares Pledge will be released upon the transfer of the Shares to the Purchaser.

11.2.3 The Junior Creditor will release the Junior Debt and the Junior Security by formal deed of release.

11.3 Following Completion the following steps will occur sequentially:

11.3.1

The Purchaser shall loan the Company the Completion Date Debt Repayment Amount. The Purchaser shall procure the payment by the Company of the Completion Date Debt Repayment Amount to the Senior Creditor as partial repayment of the Bond Debt.

11.3.2

The Bonds will be collected from the Bondholders and transferred to Newco through the Norwegian securities depository. In consideration for the Bonds, Newco will issue and deliver to the Bondholders the New Bonds pro rata to the Bondholders' holdings in the Bonds.

11.3.3 The Purchaser will acquire the Remaining Bond Debt from Newco in consideration for the Debt Sale Consideration.

11.3.4 The remaining Bond Security will be released by the Bond Trustee.

11.3.5 The Supervisors will adjudicate and agree the Fund Creditors' claims and pay a dividend from the Fund to each of the Approved Creditors in due course.

12.

SUPERVISORS' RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES

12.1 It is proposed that Chad Griffin and Lisa Jane Rickelton, both licensed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (and currently Administrators of the Company), act as Supervisors of the CVA. Chad Griffin and Lisa Jane Rickelton confirm that they are both qualified to act as insolvency practitioners in relation to the Company and the CVA.

UK - 210464869.22

18

12.2 Each Supervisor shall act as a joint Supervisor of the Company and any act required to be done by the Supervisors may be done by both or any one of them.

12.3 Under the CVA, the Supervisors will be responsible for the implementation of the CVA, including the receipt of the Contribution, the adjudication and agreement of the Fund Creditors' claims and the payment of a dividend from the Fund to each of the Approved Creditors.

12.4 No cautionary obligations are being offered for the purposes of the CVA.

12.5 Any funds which constitute the Fund shall be banked as the Supervisors may determine and where appropriate in an interest earning account of their choosing. It is not anticipated that any credit facilities will be required.

12.6 The business of the Company is being conducted by the Administrators and will be conducted by the Administrators and the Nominees subject to the approval of the CVA proposals. If the CVA is approved, and Completion occurs, the Administrators will seek to discharge the Administration Appointment in accordance with clause 13 and the Supervisors will supervise the implementation of the CVA.

12.7 Upon approval of the CVA, the Supervisors shall take all steps required by and conduct the CVA in accordance with the terms of the Act and the Rules and in addition, but without prejudice thereto, shall:

12.7.1

continue in conjunction with the Administrators (to the extent that their co operation is required whilst the administration of the Company remains in force) to manage and promote the business of the Company and/or to manage, control and supervise the affairs of the Company;

12.7.2 adjudicate as soon as reasonably possible on all claims submitted by the Fund Creditors in accordance with clause 21; and

12.7.3

be entitled to exercise all the powers contained in Schedule 1 of the Act in connection with the implementation of the CVA and in pursuance of the above functions.

12.8 From Completion the Supervisors' power in relation to the Company will be limited to all that is required to complete the CVA in accordance with clause 25.

13.

ADMINISTRATORS

13.1 The Administrators will seek to discharge the Administration Appointment as soon as is practicable after Completion. Until the Administration Appointment is discharged the Company will remain in administration. For so long as they remain in office, the Administrators shall retain all their powers and duties conferred on them under any legislation or by the Court.

13.2 The Administrators give no warranties and make no representations in relation to the information contained in this CVA Proposal.

14.

ESTABLISHMENT OF CONTRIBUTION AND FUND

14.1 Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser is obliged to lend the Contribution to the Company upon Completion. The Contribution shall be used to establish the Fund.

14.2 The amounts which constitute the Fund shall be held on trust for the benefit of the Approved Creditors in a bank account of the Supervisors' choosing, and shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of the CVA.

UK - 210464869.22

15.

CVA CREDITORS' COMMITTEE

15.1 Neither the Act nor the Rules makes provision for a CVA Creditors' committee to assist the Supervisors.

15.2 The Supervisors do not consider that a CVA Creditors' committee is necessary in respect of the CVA. This is because the Fund available for distribution to Approved Creditors is fixed and the fees charged by the Nominees and the Supervisors in relation to the CVA will be agreed between the Supervisors and the Bond Trustee and paid by the Bond Trustee from the proceeds payable to the Bond Trustee from Huntington during its administration.

15.3 If the CVA Creditors wish a CVA Creditors' committee to be established for the duration of the CVA, it is proposed that a CVA Creditors' committee be elected at the Creditors' Meeting.

15.4 Any creditor wishing to establish a CVA Creditors' committee for the duration of the CVA is requested to notify the Nominees in writing along with their Notice of Claim c/o William Marsden, FTI Consulting LLP by post to 200 Aldersgate Street, London, EC1A 4HD or to William.Marsden@fticonsulting.com by 5pm (UK time) on 14 June 2016. Alternatively, any creditor can propose a resolution to establish a CVA Creditors' committee at the Creditors' Meeting. The resolution will be voted on at the Creditors' Meeting.

15.5 All procedure in relation to membership of the CVA Creditors' committee, including attendance and voting at meetings of the committee, shall be governed in accordance with the Rules as if the committee had been appointed as a committee in administration. Meetings of the committee will be convened by the Supervisors from time to time when they consider such meetings necessary or appropriate.

15.6 The appointment of the CVA Creditors' committee and any decision by such committee shall not prevent an application being made to the Court by any party, including the Supervisors, under section 7 of the Act.

16.

TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS

16.1 In order for the Purchaser to obtain funding for, and purchase, the Shares, it is necessary to compromise the claims as set out in the CVA Proposal. This includes the proposed compromise of claims arising out of contracts which are not required by the Purchaser in the future business as either the contracts will provide no benefit to the Company in relation to its future strategy, or because they confer obligations on the Company which are too onerous for such contracts to be sustainable on an ongoing basis. Such contracts will constitute the Terminating Contracts and, if the CVA is approved and takes effect, the Company will have no further obligations under or arising out of the Terminating Contracts.

16.2 Subject always to clause 21.5, if the CVA is approved and Completion occurs, with effect from the Effective Date:

16.2.1 The Terminating Contracts shall be terminated forthwith, and the NonTerminating Contracts shall remain in force.

16.2.2

Any claims, including future claims, of CVA Creditors arising from the termination of the Terminating Contracts shall be compromised in accordance with the terms of clause 21.5 of this CVA.

16.2.3

Any CVA Creditor sustaining loss or damage as a consequence of the termination of the Terminating Contracts may include that loss or damage in its Notice of Claim. The amount of loss or damage (if any) shall be adjudicated by the

U K -210464869.22

20

Supervisors in accordance with clause 21.3. To the extent that any claim for loss or damage incurred is not an Approved Claim, the CVA Creditors will not be entitled to any payment from the Company in respect of that loss or damage.

16.2.4

The Company will be automatically released by CVA Creditors with NonTerminating Contracts from any obligations in relation to any existing breaches of, or default under, the Non-Terminating Contracts that have arisen as a result of the making of the Administration Appointment or this CVA. Any claims of CVA Creditors arising from this waiver and/or release shall be compromised in accordance with the terms of clause 21.5 of this CVA.

16.2.5

Any CVA Creditor sustaining loss or damage as a consequence of the waiver/release provided in relation to the Non-Terminating Contracts may include said loss or damage in their Notice of Claim. The amount of loss or damage (if any) shall be adjudicated by the Supervisors in accordance with clause 21.3. To the extent that any claim for loss or damage incurred is not an Approved Claim, the CVA Creditors will not be entitled to any payment from the Company in respect of this loss or damage.

17.

ANTICIPATED OUTCOME

17.1 The Fund shall be distributed (by way of a dividend) in the following manner:

Preferential Creditors

nil

Senior Creditor

nil

Junior Creditor

nil

Approved Creditors

USD $2 million ( to be converted into pounds upon receipt by the Supervisors)

Administration costs and expenses pursuant to

nil

section 19(4) of the Act

17.2 Any dividend payable to the Approved Creditors will be paid in pounds.
17.3 Based on the amounts owing to the creditors of the Company set out in Schedule 6, it is anticipated that the dividend paid to each of the Approved Creditors from the Fund will be between 4 - 6 pence in the pound. However, this is dependent on the level of claims of Approved Creditors that are agreed by the Supervisors.
17.4 If Completion does not occur, the CVA will fail and no Fund will be made available. Should the CVA fail, the terms of the CVA will cease to have effect and the rights of the Company's creditors will thereafter be unaffected by anything contained in the CVA Proposal.
17.5 As the Senior Creditor is selling the Shares, the Consideration will be paid directly to the Senior Creditor, for the benefit of the Senior Creditor only.
17.6 The Completion Date Debt Repayment Amount paid by the Company to the Senior Creditor is a partial repayment of the Bond Debt. Therefore it will be paid to the Senior Creditor (or its nominee or trustee) only.

COMPARISON TO DISSOLUTION

18.1 The Administrators and Nominees are of the opinion that the CVA would be more beneficial to the Company's creditors than any other outcome.

18.2 Without the CVA, the Company would not be able to sell Orlando or Kells, as all interest received for the sale of these assets has been contingent on the Company entering into an approved CVA as noted in clause 7.23.1. Should the CVA not be approved, the Administrators would seek to relinquish Orlando and Kells for no consideration, and file a notice for dissolution of the Company pursuant to paragraph 84 of Schedule B 1 of the Act.

18.3 Schedule 3 provides a comparison of estimated outcomes for CVA Creditors under the CVA as proposed in this CVA Proposal against dissolution. This includes an estimate of the amount of funds available to unsecured creditors under the Prescribed Part provided for under section 176A of the Act. The Administrators do not anticipate there will be sufficient funds to enable a payment to unsecured creditors by virtue of a Prescribed Part and therefore there will be no return to unsecured creditors if the CVA is not approved. If the CVA is approved and Completion occurs, the Approved Creditors will each receive a dividend from the Fund of between 4 - 6 pence in the pound of their Approved Claim.

18.4 The CVA expressly disapplies the obligation under sl76A(2) of the Act for the Administrators to set aside the Prescribed Part.

19.

THE CREDITORS

19.1 The Company's creditors as shown in the directors' Statement of Affairs in Schedule 1 are as follows:

Preferential Creditors

nil

Senior Creditor

USD $257 million

Junior Creditor

USD $6 million

Unsecured Creditors

USD $251 million

19.2 No adjudication has been made on the claims of the creditors. It is therefore necessary for the Supervisors to be granted the power to adjudicate on all claims of CVA Creditors by a resolution of the CVA Creditors. Any dividend payable to the Approved Creditors will be paid in pounds.

19.3 The Administrators do not anticipate that the Company has any Preferential Creditors.

19.4 The liability of the Company to the Senior Creditor and the Junior Creditor has been calculated for the purposes of adjudicating their claims without valuing any of the security granted to them by the other Group Companies.

19.5 As set out in Schedule 6, the Company has intercompany liabilities owed to Huntington and the Parent.

19.5.1

Huntington will be entitled to vote at the Creditors' Meeting in respect of the unsecured intercompany debt owed to it by the Company. This intercompany claim is secured in favour of the Bond Trustee. Huntington is in administration and the Administrators are also the administrators of Huntington.

U K -210464869.22

22

19.5.2

The Parent is entitled to vote at the Creditors' Meeting to approve the CVA in respect of the unsecured intercompany debt owed to it by the Company, but will not be voting. The Parent's intercompany claim is secured in favour of the Bond Trustee.

19.6 CVA Creditors who are persons connected with the Company will be treated similarly to the other CVA Creditors under the CVA. However the Parent and Huntington have elected not to receive a dividend from the Fund, in order to improve the return to Approved Creditors.

19.7 As far as the Administrators are aware, there are no circumstances giving rise to the possibility that the Administrators could apply to the Court for an order in respect of any transaction which is or may be a gratuitous alienation, unfair preference, an extortionate credit transaction or a void floating charge under sections 242, 243, 244 and 245 of the Act. It is therefore not proposed to make provision for indemnifying the Company in respect of any claims under these sections. To the extent that there are circumstances under sections 242, 243, 244 and 245 of the Act that would give rise to an order, the rights to bring such a claim have been assigned by the Company and the Administrators to Huntington pursuant to an assignation dated 27 May 2016.

19.8 If approved, the CVA will bind all creditors entitled to vote at the Creditors' Meeting had they received notice of such meeting, whether or not the relevant creditor was present or represented at the Creditors' Meeting. Whilst all proper steps have been taken by the Administrators to identify in the director's statement of affairs all creditors of the Company, if a creditor has been omitted in error from receiving notice, it will nonetheless be bound by the CVA if it is approved at the Creditors' Meeting and entitled to a dividend payment under the terms of the CVA if it is an Approved Creditor.

20.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY & CLIMATE CHANGE LIABILITY

20.1 The Secretary of State, acting through the Department of Energy & Climate Change ("DECC") is empowered to issue a notice under section 29 of the Petroleum Act 1998 ("Section 29 Notice") to the Company requiring a decommissioning plan to be produced for any oil field for which the Company has a licence. The Section 29 Notice is served on the operator and all licensees of the oil field. After the decommissioning plan is approved by DECC, all parties on which the Section 29 Notice was served are required to cany out the decommissioning plan. As at the Operative Date, Section 29 Notices had been served on the Company in relation to Orlando, Trent & Tyne and the Huntington Licence. The Company has a full indemnity from Perenco UK Limited against decommissioning liabilities in relation to Trent & Tyne.

20.2 Under section 34 of the Petroleum Act 1998, a company which has been released from its obligations under a Section 29 Notice can be required by DECC to carry out a decommissioning plan for an oil field for which it previously had a licence. Section 34 of the Petroleum Act 1998 also permits the Secretary of State to serve a Section 29 Notice on any company on whom notices could have been served since the serving of the first Section 29 Notice.

20.3 Due to the contingent liabilities that could be imposed by DECC as described above, the Secretary of State is a CVA Creditor of the Company.

21.

CVA CREDITOR CLAIMS

21.1 Only Fund Creditors may submit a completed Notice of Claim in order to receive a dividend from the Fund in respect of any Approved Claim. (All of the Company's creditors are entitled to submit a Notice of Claim in order to vote at the Creditors' Meeting.)

U K -210464869.22

23

21.2 To be entitled to a dividend from the Fund, Fund Creditors must submit a completed Notice of Claim with the Supervisors on or before the Claim Date. Notices of Claim submitted after the Claim Date will not be accepted and the Fund Creditor's claim will not be considered in accordance with clause 21.3, unless the Supervisors or the court determines that the failure to submit a Notice of Claim on or before the Claim Date was not wilful or owing to a lack of reasonable diligence on the part of the Fund Creditor. The Fund Creditor will also be required to demonstrate to the Supervisors or the Court (as applicable) that they did not receive notice of the Creditors' Meeting and that within 28 days of receiving such notice, they had submitted their claim with the Supervisors by sending a Notice of Claim.

21.3 Claims shall be proved and approved or rejected in accordance with the following procedure:

21.3.1

A person claiming to be a Fund Creditor of the Company and wishing to receive a dividend from the Fund must submit a completed Notice of Claim in the form enclosed at Schedule 12, which shall be made out by or under the directions of the Fund Creditor and signed by them or a person authorised on their behalf.

21.3.2

The Supervisors may, if they think necessary for the purpose of clarifying or substantiating the whole or any part of a Fund Creditor's claim, call for details of any matter required to be specified in the completed Notice of Claim, or for the production to them of such documentary or other evidence as they may require.

21.3.3

Fund Creditors are solely responsible for the cost of submitting their completed Notice of Claim and, if applicable, of providing such documentary or other evidence as the Supervisors may require.

21.3.4

A Notice of Claim may be approved by the Supervisors either for the whole amount claimed by the Fund Creditor, or for part of that amount, and if the Supervisors reject a Notice of Claim in whole or in part they shall prepare a written statement of their reasons for doing so, and send it to the Fund Creditor.

21.3.5

If a Fund Creditor is dissatisfied with the Supervisors' decision with respect to their Notice of Claim, they may apply to the Court under section 7(3) of the Act for the decision to be reversed or varied, and such application must be made within 21 days of the Fund Creditor receiving the written statement from the Supervisors referred to in clause 21.3.4.

21.3.6

A Notice of Claim may, at any time before payment of a dividend in accordance with clause 24, be withdrawn or varied as to the amount claimed by agreement between the relevant Fund Creditor and the Supervisors.

21.3.7

If at any time after the Claim Date the Supervisors become aware of any claim against the Company by any person who has not been given notice of the CVA, the Supervisors shall determine the amount of any such claim to be admitted for the purposes of the CVA, provided that no claim shall be admitted unless the claimant agrees to be fully bound by the terms of the CVA or the Court so directs.

21.4 No Approved Creditor shall be entitled to receive any dividend from the Supervisors or any other person under the terms of the CVA unless they are bound by the CVA by virtue o f section 5 of the Act or by an undertaking to that effect.

21.5 If the CVA is approved and Completion occurs, on and from the Effective Date:

21.5.1 all claims of the Group Companies against the Company (whether present or future, certain or contingent, and ascertained or sounding only in damages) shall

U K -210464869.22

24

be deemed to have been automatically irrevocably waived and released and they shall have no further or additional rights against the Company in respect of their unsecured claims;

21.5.2

subject to clause 21.5.3. all claims of the Fund Creditors (including any Fund Creditor who is not an Approved Creditor) against the Company shall be deemed to have been automatically irrevocably waived and released and they shall have no further or additional rights against the Company in respect of their unsecured claims;

21.5.3

for the avoidance of doubt any Approved Claim which constitutes an administration expenses (as defined and detailed in Rule 2.39B and Rule 4.67 of the Rules) will not be compromised pursuant to clause 21.5.2; and

21.5.4

only the Approved Creditors shall have a claim in respect of the Fund, and the Supervisors shall have no liability to make payment from the Fund other than to Approved Creditors.

22.

RIGHTS TO INTEREST

22.1 The amount of each Approved Claim which carries an entitlement to interest up to and including 5 January 2016 shall include interest at the contracted rate or as otherwise payable in accordance with the law up to 5 January 2016.

22.2 Interest paid pursuant to this clause 22 shall be in lieu of any other interest which would otherwise be payable to the Approved Creditor under contract or at law.

22.3 No interest shall be paid on any Approved Claim in respect of the period from and including the Operative Date.

23.

SET OFF

23.1 Where, before the Operative Date, there have been mutual credits, mutual debits or other mutual dealings between the Company and the Approved Creditor, an account shall be taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of such mutual dealings and the amounts due from one party shall be set off against the amounts due from the other. Only the balance (if any) shall be treated as an Approved Claim for the purposes of clause 24.

23.2 Amounts due from the Company to an Approved Creditor in respect of a claim made under the CVA shall not be included in the account taken under clause 23.1 if a court of competent jurisdiction so orders or if it is agreed by the Supervisors and the Approved Creditor that set-off is not permitted.

24.

DIVIDEND TO APPROVED CREDITORS

24.1 A dividend will only be payable to each of the Approved Creditors after Completion has occurred. Any dividend payable will be paid in pounds.

24.2 Any creditor whose Notice of Claim is submitted but is not approved by the Supervisors will not be entitled to a dividend unless the Fund Creditor applies to the Court in accordance with the procedure in clause 21.3.5 and the Court orders a dividend to be paid to that Fund Creditor.

24.3 The Fund will be divided and allocated in the following priority:

24.3.1 firstly, in payment in full of all sums due to the Preferential Creditors of the Company (of which there are none, as far as the Administrators are aware) as at

U K -210464869.22

25

the Operative Date in accordance with the Act and the Rules, subject to such variation of their rights as may be agreed with them; and

24.3.2 secondly, to each Approved Creditor by way of a dividend or dividends from the Fund pro rata to its Approved Claim.

24.4 The Supervisors shall determine the date or dates when payment of the dividend shall be made. Dividends shall be paid by either:

24.4.1 Bankers' Automated Clearing Services to such bank account as the Approved Creditor notifies to the Supervisors in their Notice of Claim; or

24.4.2

cheque drawn in favour of the relevant Approved Creditor which shall be sent by first class ordinary post in an envelope to the address notified by the relevant Approved Creditor to the Supervisors in their Notice of Claim.

24.5 The encashment of the cheque or the receipt of the amount of a telegraphic transfer into the relevant account shall be a good and proper discharge of the Supervisors' obligations under the CVA. The Supervisors shall not be liable to the relevant Approved Creditor for any loss in transmission of a cheque drawn and sent or a telegraphic transfer made in accordance with clause 24.4.

24.6 Any dividend that is not claimed within three months of payment by the Supervisor under clause 24.4 shall be deemed unclaimed property. The Approved Creditor entitled to that dividend shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived its rights thereto. The Supervisors may in their sole discretion determine how any unclaimed property of the Fund is applied.

25.

DURATION OF COMPANY VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT

25.1 The duration of the CVA shall be such time as is required (i) for the completion of the sale of the Shares; (ii) to receive the Contribution; (iii) to adjudicate and agree the Fund Creditors' claims; and (iv) to pay dividends from the Fund to each of the Approved Creditors according to the provisions of the CVA. It is possible that if certain of the Fund Creditors' claims are the subject of legal dispute, the duration of the CVA may be extended but it is anticipated that it will be no more than nine months in duration and potentially far shorter.

25.2 The CVA shall be completed when the sale of the Shares to the Purchaser has completed and the Fund has been distributed to each of the Approved Creditors by way of dividend and the Supervisors shall have taken any steps required by the CVA and by the Act and the Rules to complete the CVA.

26.

NOMINEES' FEES AND EXPENSES

26.1 The Nominees' fees and expenses will be paid out of the proceeds payable to the Bond Trustee from Huntington during its administration.

26.2 The Nominees' fees and expenses will be charged on the same basis as noted in Schedule 10.

27.

SUPERVISORS' FEES AND EXPENSES

27.1 The Supervisors' fees and expenses will be paid by the Bond Trustee from the proceeds payable to the Bond Trustee from Huntington during its administration. An estimate of the Supervisors' fees and expenses is contained at Schedule 9 for disclosure purposes only and will not affect the amount available to the Approved Creditors from the Fund.

U K -210464869.22

26

27.2 It is proposed that the Supervisors of the CVA be remunerated on a time basis, at a discounted rate (having regard to the complexity, importance and expedition of the matter) together with reimbursement for all out of pocket expenses or other fees, costs and expenses reasonably and properly incurred including but not limited to legal fees.
27.3 Details of the Supervisors' rates and expenses are provided at Schedule 10.

28.

INDEMNITY

28.1 The Supervisors shall at all times on and from the Effective Date be fully and effectively indemnified from the Fund from and against all debts, liabilities and obligations of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising out of or in connection with the performance by either one or both Supervisors of any duties or functions under the CVA or of any acts or omissions of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising in performing and carrying into effect the provisions of the CVA.

28.2 Further, the Supervisors shall not incur any personal liability of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising in connection with or in any way arising from or pursuant to the CVA.

29.

MODIFICATION OR VARIATION OF COMPANY VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT

29.1 The Supervisors will have the power at any time after the approval of the CVA at the Creditors' Meeting to modify the provisions of the CVA provided that such modifications do not materially alter the effect or economic substance of the CVA. The Supervisors shall inform the CVA Creditors and the Company of any such modifications by amending and restating the CVA and making it available to the CVA Creditors and such modifications shall be binding on the Company, the CVA Creditors and the Supervisors.

29.2 If at any time after the approval of the CVA the Supervisors are of the opinion that a material (as determined by the Supervisors) modification, addition or variation of the CVA may be required, they shall call a meeting of the CVA Creditors (and, if necessary, of the Company) for the purpose of considering the same and the provisions of the Rules with regard to notice for meetings shall apply and not less than 14 days' notice shall be given.

30.

AMBIGUITY

Where any part of this CVA Proposal incorporates any provisions of the Act or Rules which gives rise to an ambiguity or inconsistency, then the Supervisors shall in their absolute discretion resolve such ambiguity or inconsistency as they shall think fit and the exercise of such discretion shall not be open to any challenge by legal proceedings or otherwise by any CVA Creditor or by the Company or by any person on their behalf.

31.

RELEASE OF ADMINISTRATORS

31.1 The Company and each CVA Creditor releases the Administrators, their firm, their fellow members, partners and employees, and the legal and other professional advisors to the Administrators and their fellow members, partners and employees, from any liability (whether present, future, prospective or contingent) arising in connection with:

31.1.1 their acts, omissions or defaults as Administrators or professional advisors from and including the Operative Date; and/or

31.1.2 the preparation, negotiation and implementation of the CVA or any matter ancillary to the CVA,

other than arising from fraud, gross negligence or wilful default.

32.

VACANCY IN THE OFFICE OF SUPERVISOR

32.1 Without prejudice to sections 7(5) and (6) of the Act, if for any reason whatsoever a vacancy arises in the office of a sole Supervisor, the CVA Creditors may fill that vacancy at a meeting called for that purpose, such meeting to be called by:

32.1.1 the Administrators;

32.1.2 any CVA Creditor; or

32.1.3 any person who was in partnership with the Supervisor immediately before the vacancy occurred.

32.2 Such a meeting must be chaired by a person qualified to act as an insolvency practitioner or a partner or senior employee of the former Supervisor's firm experienced in insolvency matters.

32.3 Any resignation by a sole Supervisor shall not take effect until a replacement Supervisor is appointed under these provisions or by the Court.

32.4 Where a Supervisor is replaced (whether the replacement is single or multiple) there shall be deemed to be continuation in office for all purposes under the CVA save that a successor Supervisor shall not be personally liable for the negligence, breach of contract, dishonesty, or acts or omissions of any former Supervisor.

33.

RELEASE AND DISCHARGE OF SUPERVISORS

33.1 The Company and each CVA Creditor releases the Supervisors, their firm, their fellow members, partners and employees, and the legal and other professional advisors to the Supervisors and their fellow members, partners and employees, from any liability (whether present, future, prospective or contingent) arising in connection with:

33.1.1 their acts, omissions or defaults taken directly or indirectly in relation to their conduct as Supervisors; and/or

33.1.2 the implementation of the CVA or any matter ancillary to the CVA,

other than arising from fraud, gross negligence or wilful default.

33.2 The Supervisors shall be discharged from their office on completion of the CVA in accordance with clause 25 and after discharging their duties under the Act and under the Rules in connection therewith.

34.

MORATORIUM

The CVA will be binding on all the CVA Creditors upon the approval of the CVA by the Creditors' Meeting summoned under section 3 of the Act and in accordance with the provisions thereof and accordingly none of the CVA Creditors shall thereafter be entitled to require or demand payment of any debt due by the Company, or commence action or other proceedings against the Company, or pursue or continue any action or other proceedings against the Company, in each case in respect of any matter or debt arising or incurred prior to the Operative Date and the only right of each of the Approved Creditors shall be to receive a dividend from the Fund in respect of an Approved Claim.

35.

THIRD PARTIES

Nothing in this CVA Proposal is intended to prevent any of the CVA Creditors from suing or recovering payment from any person who may have become in any manner liable for payment

U K -210464869.22

28

of any debts of the Company (but who are not the Company). The CVA Creditors shall be entitled to exercise all their remedies against such persons in the same manner as if this CVA Proposal and approval had not been made and given respectively.

36.

THE EC REGULATION

36.1 The EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000) (the "EC Regulation") will apply to the CVA. The administration of the Company and the CVA (if approved) will be main proceedings as defined in Article 3 of the EC Regulation as the Company has its registered office in Scotland and the Company's centre of main interests is Scotland in the United Kingdom.

SCHEDULE 7 COMPANY VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENTS - A CREDITORS' GUIDE TO INSOLVENCY
PRACTITIONERS' FEES

1.

INTRODUCTION

1.1

In a voluntary arrangement, as in other types of insolvency, the amount of money available for

creditors is likely to be affected by the level of costs, including the remuneration of the

insolvency practitioner appointed to implement the arrangement. This guide explains how fees

are fixed in voluntary arrangements, how the creditors can affect the level of fees, and the

information which should be made available to them regarding fees.

2.

THE VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT PROCEDURE

2.1

Voluntary arrangements are available to companies and are often referred to asCVAs.

2.2

The procedure enables the company to put a proposal to their creditors for a composition in

satisfaction of their debts or a scheme of arrangement of their affairs. A composition is an

agreement under which creditors agree to accept a certain sum of money in settlement of the

debts due to them. A CVA may be used as a stand-alone procedure or as an exit route from an

administration. It may also be used where a company is in liquidation, but this is extremely rare.

The proposal will be made by the directors, the administrator or the liquidator, depending on the

circumstances. The procedure is extremely flexible and the form which the voluntary

arrangement takes will depend on the terms of the proposal agreed by the creditors. The

proposal must provide for an insolvency practitioner to supervise the implementation of the

arrangement. Until the proposal is approved by the creditors, the practitioner is known as the

nominee. If the proposal is approved, the nominee (or if the creditors choose to replace him, his

replacement) becomes the supervisor.

3.

FEES, COSTS AND CHARGES - STATUTORY PROVISIONS

3.1

The fees, costs, charges and expenses which may be incurred for the purposes of a voluntary

arrangement are set out in Rule 1.22 of the Insolvency (Scotland) Rules 1986 (as amended)

(the "Rules"). They are:

3.1.1 any disbursements made by the nominee prior to the decision approving the arrangement taking effect under section 4A of the Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended), and any remuneration for his services agreed between himself and the company (or the administrator or liquidator, as the case may be); and

3.1.2 any fees, costs, charges or expenses which:

(a)

are sanctioned by the terms of the arrangement (see below); or

(b)

would be payable, or correspond to those which would be payable, in an

administration or winding up.

3.2

Rule 1.3 of the Rules also require the following matters to be stated or otherwise dealt with in

the proposal:

3.2.1 the amount proposed to paid to the nominee (as such) by way of remuneration and expenses; and

UK - 210464869.22

55

3.2.2 the manner in which it is proposed that the supervisor of the arrangement should be remunerated and his expenses defrayed.

4.

THE ROLE OF THE CREDITORS

4.1

It is for the creditors' meeting to decide whether to agree the terms relating to remuneration

along with the other provisions of the proposal. The creditors' meeting has the power to modify

any of the terms of the proposal, including those relating to the fixing of remuneration. The

nominee should be prepared to disclose the basis of his fees to the meeting if called upon to do

so. Although there are no further statutory provisions relating to remuneration in voluntary

arrangements, the terms of the proposal may provide for the establishment of a committee of

creditors and may include among its functions the fixing of the supervisor's remuneration.

5.

WHAT INFORMATION SHOULD THE CREDITORS RECEIVE?

5.1

Whether the basis of the supervisor's remuneration is determined at the meeting which approves

the arrangement or by a committee of creditors, the supervisor, or proposed supervisor should

provide details of the charge-out rates of all grades of staff, including principals, which are

likely to be involved on the case.

5.2

Where the supervisor's fees are to be agreed by a committee of creditors during the course of

the arrangement, the supervisor should provide sufficient supporting information to enable the

committee to form a judgement as to whether the proposed fee is reasonable having regard to all

the circumstances of the case, and should always provide an up to date receipts and payments

account. Where the fee is to be charged on a time basis the supervisor should disclose the

amount of time spent on the case and the charge out value of the time spent, together with such

additional information as may reasonably be required having regard to the size and complexity

of the case and the functions conferred on the supervisor under the terms of the arrangement.

The additional information should comprise a sufficient explanation of what the supervisor has

achieved and how it was achieved to enable the value of the exercise to be assessed and to

establish that the time has been properly spent on the case.

5.3

Where the basis of the remuneration of the supervisor as set out in the proposal does not require

any further approvals by the creditors or any committee of creditors, the supervisor should

specify the amount of remuneration he has drawn in accordance with the provisions of the

proposal in his subsequent reports to creditors on the progress of the arrangement. Where the

fee is based on time costs he should also provide details of the time spent and charge-out value

to date and any material changes in the rates charged for the various grades since the

arrangement was approved. He should also provide such additional information as may be

required in accordance with paragraph 5.2.

5.4

Where the supervisor proposes to recover costs which, whilst being in the nature of expenses or

disbursements, may include an element of shared or allocated costs (such as room hire,

document storage or communication facilities provided by the supervisor's own firm), they

must be disclosed and be authorised by those responsible for approving his remuneration. Such

expenses must be directly incurred on the case and subject to a reasonable method of calculation

and allocation. A charge for disbursements calculated as a percentage of the amount charged for

remuneration is not allowed.

1.

BASIS OF TIME COSTS

1.1

The Supervisors' fees and expenses will be met by the Bond Trustee from the proceeds payable

to the Bond Trustee from Huntington during its administration. The fees and expenses incurred

by the Supervisors will not impact the Fund or the dividends to be distributed out of the Fund.

1.2

The time charged to the CVA is by reference to the time properly given by the Supervisors and

their staff in attending to matters arising in connection with the CVA. It is the Supervisors'

policy to delegate tasks in the CVA to appropriate members of staff considering their levels of

experience and any requisite specialism, supervised accordingly, so as to maximise the cost

effectiveness of the work performance. In addition to the Supervisors' restructuring staff, the

Supervisors may utilise the services of specialist departments within the Supervisors' firm, such

as tax. Those departments will charge hours when the Supervisors require their advice.

1.3

With regard to support staff, we would advise that time spent by cashiers in relation to specific

tasks on an assignment is charged. Only if there is a large block of time incurred by a member

of the secretarial team, e.g. report compilation and distribution, do we seek to charge and

recover our time in this regard.

1.4

The minimum time increment charged by the Supervisors and their staff is 6 mins. The charge

out rates for each category of staff is provided below:
