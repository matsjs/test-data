Forward-looking statements include statements that address activities, events or developments that the Company expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, particularly in
ii

relation to our operations, cash flows, financial position, liquidity and cash available for dividends or distributions, plans, strategies, business prospects and changes and trends in our business and the markets in which we operate. In some cases, predictive, future-tense or forward-looking words such as "believe", "intend", "anticipate", "estimate", "project", "forecast", "plan", "potential", "may", "should", "could" and "expect" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. In addition, we and our representatives may from time to time make other oral or written statements which are forward-looking statements, including in our periodic reports that we file with the SEC, other information sent to our security holders, and other written materials. We caution that these forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this annual report or the date on which such oral or written statements are made, as applicable, about factors that are beyond our ability to control or predict, and are not intended to give any assurance as to future results. Any of these factors or a combination of these factors could materially affect future results of operations and the ultimate accuracy of the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not unduly rely on any forward-looking statements.
Factors that might cause future results and outcomes to differ include, but are not limited to, the following:
· general LNG shipping market conditions and trends, including spot and long-term charter rates, ship values, factors affecting supply and demand of LNG and LNG shipping, technological advancements and opportunities for the profitable operation of LNG carriers;
· continued low prices for crude oil and petroleum products and volatility in gas prices;
· our ability to enter into time charters with new and existing customers;
· increased exposure to spot market and fluctuations in spot charter rates;
· changes in the ownership of our charterers;
· our customers' performance of their obligations under our time charters and other contracts;
· our future operating performance, financial condition, liquidity and cash available for dividends and distributions;
· our ability to obtain financing to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate activities, funding by banks of their financial commitments, and our ability to meet our restrictive covenants and other obligations under our credit facilities;
· future, pending or recent acquisitions of or orders for ships or other assets, business strategy, areas of possible expansion and expected capital spending or operating expenses;
· the time that it may take to construct and deliver newbuildings and the useful lives of our ships;
· number of off-hire days, dry-docking requirements and insurance costs;
· fluctuations in currencies and interest rates;
· our ability to maintain long-term relationships with major energy companies;
· our ability to maximize the use of our ships, including the re-employment or disposal of ships no longer under time charter commitments, including the risk that our vessels may no longer have the latest technology at such time;
· environmental and regulatory conditions, including changes in laws and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities;
· the expected cost of, and our ability to comply with, governmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization standards, requirements imposed by classification societies and standards imposed by our charterers applicable to our business;
· risks inherent in ship operation, including the discharge of pollutants;
· our ability to retain key employees and the availability of skilled labor, ship crews and management;
iii

· potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents, political events, piracy or acts by terrorists;
· potential liability from future litigation; · our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations; · any malfunction or disruption of information technology systems and networks that our operations rely on or any impact of a possible
cybersecurity breach; and · other factors discussed in "Item 3. Key Information--D. Risk Factors" of this annual report.
We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this annual report, whether as a result of new information, future events, a change in our views or expectations or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of these factors.

111 Gives effect to the 238-for-1 share split effected on March 13, 2012.
121 Consists o f our 25.0% ownership interest in Egypt LNG and our 33.33% ownership interest in the Cool Pool. On October 1, 2015, GasLog, Dynagas and Golar signed a LNG carrier pooling agreement to establish the Cool Pool to market their vessels, which are currently operating in the LNG shipping spot market. The Cool Pool allows the participating owners to optimize the operation o f the pool vessels through improved scheduling ability, cost efficiencies and common marketing. The objective o f the Cool Pool is to serve the transportation requirements o f a rapidly growing LNG shipping market by providing customers with reliable, yet flexible, and innovative solutions to meet their increasingly complex shipping requirements. The Cool Pool was incorporated in September 2015.
131 Includes delivered ships (including dry-docking component o f vessel cost) as well as office property and other tangible assets, less accumulated depreciation. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.
(4) Presentation o f fleet data does not include newbuildings on order during the relevant periods. The data presented regarding our owned fleet includes only our owned ships delivered prior to December 31, 2016 including the ships owned by GasLog Partners. The data presented regarding our managed fleet includes our wholly owned vessels as well as ships owned by GasLog Partners, Shell, Egypt LNG and Lepta Shipping that are operating under our management.
(5) The operating days for our owned and bareboat fleet are the total number o f days in a given period that the vessels (including the Methane Julia Louise, our vessel on a bareboat charter) were in our possession less the total number o f days off-hire not recoverable from the insurers. In 2016, operating days include 1,185 days for our vessels operating in the Cool Pool. We define days off-hire as days lost to, among other things, operational deficiencies, dry-docking for repairs, maintenance or inspection, equipment breakdowns, special surveys and vessel upgrades, delays due to accidents, crew strikes, certain vessel detentions or similar problems, our failure to maintain the vessel in compliance with its specifications and contractual standards or to provide the required crew, or periods of commercial waiting time during which we do not earn charter hire.
161 Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
EBITDA is defined as earnings before depreciation, amortization, interest income and expense, gain/loss on swaps and taxes. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before foreign exchange gains/losses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that are used as supplemental financial measures by management and external users of financial statements, such as investors, to assess our financial and operating performance. W e believe that these non-GAAP financial measures assist our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to period. We believe that including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA assists our management and investors in (i) understanding and analyzing the results o f our operating and business performance, (ii) selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives and (iii) monitoring our ongoing financial and operational strength in assessing whether to continue to hold our common shares. This is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods of interest, gain/loss on swaps, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, foreign exchange gains/losses, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect results of operations between periods.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives to, or as substitutes for, or superior to profit, profit from operations or any other measure o f financial performance presented in accordance with IFRS. Some o f these limitations include the fact that they do not reflect (i) our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) changes in, or cash requirements for our working capital needs and (iii) the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt. Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows and other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.
In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the excluded items. Therefore, the non-GAAP financial measures
4

as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures o f other companies in the shipping or other industries. Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Profit:

Profit for the year Depreciation Financial costs Financial income Loss/(gain) on swaps EBITDA Foreign exchange (gains)/losses, net Adjusted EBITDA

D. Risk Factors
Risks Inherent to Our Business
Ourfuture performance and ability to secure future time charters depends on continued growth in LNG production and demandfo r LNG and LNG shipping.
Our future performance, including our ability to profitably expand our fleet, will depend on continued growth in LNG production and the demand for LNG and LNG shipping. A complete LNG project includes production, liquefaction, storage, regasification and distribution facilities, in addition to the marine transportation of LNG. Increased infrastructure investment has led to an expansion of LNG production capacity in recent years, but material delays in the construction of new liquefaction facilities could constrain the amount of LNG available for shipping, reducing ship utilization. The rate of growth of the LNG industry has fluctuated due to several factors, including the global economic crisis and continued economic uncertainty, fluctuations in global commodity prices, including natural gas, oil and coal as well as other sources of energy. Continued growth in LNG production and demand for LNG and LNG shipping could be negatively affected by a number of factors, including:
· continued low prices for crude oil and petroleum products and volatility in gas prices; · increases in interest rates or other events that may affect the availability of sufficient financing for LNG projects on commercially reasonable
terms; · increases in the cost of natural gas derived from LNG relative to the cost of natural gas generally; · increases in the production levels of low-cost natural gas in domestic natural gas consuming markets, which could further depress prices for
natural gas in those markets and make LNG uneconomical; · increases in the production of natural gas in areas linked by pipelines to consuming areas, the extension of existing, or the development of new
pipeline systems in markets we may serve, or the conversion of existing non-natural gas pipelines to natural gas pipelines in those markets; · decreases in the consumption of natural gas due to increases in its price, decreases in the price of alternative energy sources, including coal, or
other factors making consumption of natural gas less attractive; · any significant explosion, spill or other incident involving a LNG facility or carrier; · infrastructure constraints such as delays in the construction of liquefaction facilities, the inability of project owners or operators to obtain
governmental approvals to construct or operate LNG facilities, as well as community or political action group resistance to new LNG infrastructure due to concerns about the environment, safety and terrorism; · labor or political unrest or military conflicts affecting existing or proposed areas of LNG production or regasification; · decreases in the price of LNG, which might decrease the expected returns relating to investments in LNG projects; · new taxes or regulations affecting LNG production or liquefaction that make LNG production less attractive; or · negative global or regional economic or political conditions, particularly in LNG consuming regions, which could reduce energy consumption or its growth.
In recent years, global crude oil prices were very volatile. Any decline in oil prices can depress natural gas prices and lead to a narrowing of the gap in pricing in different geographic regions,
6

which can adversely affect the length of voyages in the spot LNG shipping market and the spot rates and medium term charter rates for charters which commence in the near future. Any continued period of low oil prices could adversely affect both the competitiveness of gas as a fuel for power generation and the market price of gas, to the extent that gas prices are benchmarked to the price of crude oil.
Some production companies have announced delays or cancellations of certain previously announced LNG projects, which, unless offset by new projects coming on stream, could adversely affect demand for LNG charters over the next few years, while the amount of tonnage available for charter is expected to increase.
If the anticipated improvement of charter market conditions does not materialise, we may have difficulty in securing charters at attractive rates and durations on our ships when we are seeking a new charter. Such a failure may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, as well as our ability to meet certain of our debt covenants. A sustained decline in charter rates could also adversely affect the market value of our ships, on which certain of the ratios and financial covenants we are required to comply with are based. See "--Risks Related to Our Business--Our credit facilities are secured by our ships and contain payment obligations and restrictive covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities as well as our ability to pay dividends. A failure by us to meet our obligations under our credit facilities could result in an event of default under such credit facilities and foreclosure on our ships."
A continuation o f the recent volatility in natural gas and oil prices may adversely affect our growth prospects, results o f operations and cash flows.
Natural gas prices are volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including but not limited to the following:
· price and availability of crude oil and petroleum products;
· worldwide demand for natural gas and oil; · the cost of exploration, development, production, transportation and distribution of natural gas;
· expectations regarding future energy prices for both natural gas and other sources of energy;
· the level of worldwide LNG production and exports;
· government laws and regulations, including but not limited to environmental protection laws and regulations;
· local and international political, economic and weather conditions;
· political and military conflicts; and · the availability and cost of alternative energy sources, including alternate sources of natural gas in gas importing and consuming countries.
Natural gas prices have historically varied substantially between regions. This price disparity between producing and consuming regions supports demand for LNG shipping and any convergence of natural gas prices could adversely affect demand or price for LNG shipping. In recent years, global crude oil prices were very volatile. Any decline in oil prices can depress natural gas prices and lead to a narrowing of the gap in pricing in different geographic regions.
Given the significant global natural gas and crude oil price volatility as referenced above, a continuation of volatility in natural gas or oil prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, as a result of, among other things:
· a reduction in exploration for or development of new natural gas reserves or projects, or the delay or cancelation of existing projects as energy companies lower their capital expenditures budgets, which may reduce our growth opportunities;
7

· low oil prices negatively affecting both the competitiveness of natural gas as a fuel for power generation and the market price of natural gas, to the extent that natural gas prices are benchmarked to the price of crude oil;
· lower demand for vessels of the types we own and operate, which may reduce available charter rates and revenue to us upon redeployment of our vessels following expiration or termination of existing contracts or upon the initial chartering of vessels;
· customers potentially seeking to renegotiate or terminate existing vessel contracts, or failing to extend or renew contracts upon expiration; · the inability or refusal of customers to make charter payments to us due to financial constraints or otherwise; or · declines in vessel values, which may result in losses to us upon vessel sales or impairment charges against our earnings.
Ourfuture growth depends on our ability to expand relationships with existing customers, establish relationships with new customers and obtain new time charter contracts, fo r which we willface substantial competition from established companies with significant resources and potential new entrants.
We are seeking to enter into time charter contracts for, (i) the GasLog Singapore, the GasLog Chelsea, the GasLog Savannah, the GasLog Saratoga and the GasLog Salem, which operate in the Cool Pool, and (ii) the GasLog Skagen, which operates on a seasonal contract (i.e., employed for seven months and available to accept other charters for five months per year). We will also seek to enter into new time charter contracts upon the expiration or early termination of our existing charter arrangements, and upon any expansion of our fleet of owned ships beyond our contracted newbuildings. One of our principal objectives is to enter into additional long-term, fixed-rate charters. In addition, we may seek to expand the customer base for our ship management services. The process of obtaining charters for LNG carriers is highly competitive and generally involves an intensive screening procedure and competitive bids, which often extends for several months. We believe LNG carrier time charters are awarded based upon a variety of factors relating to the ship and the ship operator, including:
· size, age, technical specifications and condition of the ship; · efficiency of ship operation; · LNG shipping experience and quality of ship operations; · shipping industry relationships and reputation for customer service; · technical ability and reputation for operation of highly specialized ships; · quality and experience of officers and crew; · safety record; · the ability to finance ships at competitive rates and financial stability generally; · relationships with shipyards and the ability to get suitable berths; · construction management experience, including the ability to obtain on-time delivery of new ships according to customer specifications; and · competitiveness of the bid in terms of overall price.
We expect substantial competition for providing marine transportation services for potential LNG projects from a number of experienced companies, including other independent ship owners as well as state-sponsored entities and major energy companies that own and operate LNG carriers and may compete with independent owners by using their fleets to carry LNG for third parties. Some of these competitors have significantly greater financial resources and larger fleets than we have. A number of marine transportation companies--including companies with strong reputations and extensive resources and experience--have entered the LNG transportation market in recent years, and there are other ship owners and managers who may also attempt to participate in the LNG
8

market in the future. This increased competition may cause greater price competition for time charters. As a result of these factors, we may be unable to expand our relationships with existing customers or to obtain new customers on a profitable basis, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
Hire ratesfo r LNG carriers may fluctuate substantially and are currently below historical average rates. I f rates are lower when we are seeking a new charter, our revenues and cash flows may decline.
Our ability from time to time to charter or re-charter any ship at attractive rates will depend on, among other things, the prevailing economic conditions in the LNG industry. Hire rates for LNG carriers may fluctuate over time as a result of changes in the supply-demand balance relating to current and future ship capacity. This supply-demand relationship largely depends on a number of factors outside our control. The LNG charter market is connected to world natural gas prices and energy markets, which we cannot predict. A substantial or extended decline in demand for natural gas or LNG could adversely affect our ability to charter or re-charter our ships at acceptable rates or to acquire and profitably operate new ships. Hire rates for newbuildings are correlated with the price of newbuildings. Hire rates at a time when we may be seeking new charters may be lower than the hire rates at which our ships are currently chartered. If hire rates are lower when we are seeking a new charter, or at the time option extensions are due to be declared, our revenues and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, may decline, as we may only be able to enter into new charters at reduced or unprofitable rates or may not be able to re-charter our ship, or we may have to secure a charter in the spot market, where hire rates are more volatile. Prolonged periods of low charter hire rates or low ship utilization could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our assets.
These factors, among others, have in turn led to a significant shortening of the average duration of spot charters fixed during 2016, as well as a significant decline in average rates for new spot and shorter-term LNG charters commencing promptly. Unless LNG charter market conditions improve, we may have difficulty in securing new charters at attractive rates and durations for those vessels in the Cool Pool. As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 1,978 open vessel days during 2017, including 1,825 days for the five vessels operating in the Cool Pool.
An oversupply o f LNG carriers may lead to a reduction in the charter hire rates we are able to obtain when seeking charters in the future which could adversely affect our results o f operations and cash flows.
Driven in part by an increase in LNG production capacity, the market supply of LNG carriers has been increasing as a result of the construction of new ships. The development of liquefaction projects in the United States and the anticipated exports beginning in early 2016 have driven significant ordering activity. As of December 31, 2016, the LNG carrier order book totalled 115 vessels, and the delivered fleet stood at 417 vessels. This and any future expansion of the global LNG carrier fleet may have a negative impact on charter hire rates, ship utilization and ship values, which impact could be amplified if the expansion of LNG production capacity does not keep pace with fleet growth.
If charter hire rates are lower when we are seeking new time charters, our revenues and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, may decline.
I f an active short-term or spot LNG carrier charter market continues to develop, our revenues and cash flows may become more volatile and may declinefollowing expiration or early termination o f our current charter arrangements.
Most shipping requirements for new LNG projects continue to be provided on a multi-year basis, though the level of spot voyages and short-term time charters of less than 12 months in duration has grown in the past few years. If an active short-term or spot charter market continues to
9

develop, we may enter into short-term time charters upon expiration or early termination of our current charters, for any ships for which we have not secured charters, or for any new ships we acquire beyond our contracted newbuildings. As a result, our revenues and cash flows may become more volatile. In addition, an active short-term or spot charter market may require us to enter into charters based on changing market prices, as opposed to contracts based on fixed rates, which could result in a decrease in our revenues and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, if we enter into charters during periods when the market price for shipping LNG is depressed.
Further technological advancements and other innovations affecting LNG carriers could reduce the charter hire rates we are able to obtain when seeking new employment, and this could adversely impact the value o f our assets and our results o f operations and cash flows.
The charter rates, asset value and operational life of a LNG carrier are determined by a number of factors, including the ship's efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes speed and fuel economy. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits. Physical life is related to the original design and construction, the ongoing maintenance and the impact of operational stresses on the asset. Ship and engine designs are continually evolving. At such time as newer designs are developed and accepted in the market, these newer vessels may be found to be more efficient or more flexible or have longer physical lives than our ships. Competition from these more technologically advanced LNG carriers and the older technology of our steam-powered ("Steam") vessels, as well as any vessels with older technology which we acquire, could adversely affect our ability to charter or re-charter our ships and the charter hire rates we will be able to secure when we seek to charter or re-charter our ships, and could also reduce the resale value of our ships. This could adversely affect our revenues and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
Risks associated with operating and managing ocean-going ships could affect our business and reputation. The operation and management of ocean-going ships carries inherent risks. These risks include the possibility of: · marine disaster; · piracy; · environmental accidents; · adverse weather conditions; · grounding, fire, explosions and collisions; · cargo and property loss or damage; · business interruptions caused by mechanical failure, human error, war, terrorism, disease and quarantine, or political action in various countries; and · work stoppages or other labor problems with crew members serving on our ships. An accident involving any of our owned or managed ships could result in any of the following: · death or injury to persons, loss of property or environmental damage; · delays in the delivery of cargo; · loss of revenues from termination of charter contracts or ship management agreements; · governmental fines, penalties or restrictions on conducting business; · litigation with our employees, customers or third parties; · higher insurance rates; and · damage to our reputation and customer relationships generally. 10

Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
Our insurance may be insufficient to cover losses that may occur to our property or result from our operations which could adversely affect our results o f operations and cash flows.
The operation of any ship includes risks such as mechanical failure, personal injury, collision, fire, contact with floating objects, property loss or damage, cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to a number of reasons, including political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities and labor strikes. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of a marine disaster, including explosion, spills and other environmental mishaps, and other liabilities arising from owning, operating or managing ships in international trade.
Although we carry protection and indemnity, hull and machinery and loss of hire and delay insurance covering our owned ships consistent with industry standards, we can give no assurance that we are adequately insured against all risks or that our insurers will pay a particular claim. We also may be unable to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future. Even if our insurance coverage is adequate to cover our losses, we may not be able to obtain a timely replacement ship in the event of a loss of a ship. Any uninsured or underinsured loss could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to shareholders. Similarly, although we carry ship manager insurance in connection with our management of third-party ships, we can give no assurance that such insurance will adequately insure us against all risks associated with our ship management services, that our insurers will pay a particular claim or that we will be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future.
In addition, some of our insurance coverage is maintained through mutual protection and indemnity associations, and as a member of such associations we may be required to make additional payments over and above budgeted premiums if member claims exceed association reserves.
The required dry-docking o f our ships could be more expensive and time consuming than we anticipate, which could adversely affect our results o f operations and cash flows.
Dry-dockings of our owned ships require significant capital expenditures and result in loss of revenue while our ships are off-hire. Any significant increase in either the number of off-hire days due to such dry-dockings or in the costs of any repairs carried out during the dry-dockings could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and our cash flows. We may not be able to accurately predict the time required to dry-dock any of our ships or any unanticipated problems that may arise. If more than one of our ships is required to be out of service at the same time, or if a ship is dry-docked longer than expected or if the cost of repairs during the dry-docking is greater than budgeted, our results of operations and our cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, could be adversely affected. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the dry-dockings of the Methane Rita Andrea and the Methane Jane Elizabeth (ships owned by GasLog Partners) were completed. The dry-dockings of the remainder of our vessels are expected to be carried out between 2018 and 2021.
We may experience operational problems with vessels that reduce revenue and increase costs.
LNG carriers are complex and their operations are technically challenging. Marine transportation operations are subject to mechanical risks and problems. Operational problems may lead to loss of revenue or higher than anticipated operating expenses or require additional capital expenditures. Any of these results could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our shareholders.
11

Changes in global and regional economic conditions could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results o f operations and cash flows.
Weak global or regional economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders in ways that we cannot predict. Our ability to expand our fleet beyond our contracted newbuildings will be dependent on our ability to obtain financing to fund the acquisition of additional ships. In addition, uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions may cause our customers to defer projects in response to tighter credit, decreased capital availability and declining customer confidence, which may negatively impact the demand for our ships and services and could also result in defaults under our current charters or termination of our ship management contracts. Global financial markets and economic conditions have been volatile in recent years and remain subject to significant vulnerabilities. In particular, despite recent measures taken by the European Union, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries, including Greece, and their ability to meet future financial obligations, and the overall stability of the euro. Furthermore, a tightening of the credit markets may further negatively impact our operations by affecting the solvency of our suppliers or customers which could lead to disruptions in delivery of supplies such as equipment for conversions, cost increases for supplies, accelerated payments to suppliers, customer bad debts or reduced revenues. Similarly, such market conditions could affect lenders participating in our financing agreements, making them unable to fulfill their commitments and obligations to us. Any reductions in activity owing to such conditions or failure by our customers, suppliers or lenders to meet their contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
GasLog LNG Services, our vessels' management company, and a substantial number of its staff are located in Greece. The current economic instability in Greece could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business. We have sought to minimize this risk and preserve operational stability by carefully developing staff deployment plans, an information technology recovery site, an alternative ship to shore communications plan and funding mechanisms. While we believe these plans, combined with the international nature of our operations, will mitigate the impact of any disruption of operations in Greece, there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in all circumstances.
Disruptions in worldfinancial markets could limit our ability to obtain future debtfinancing or refinance existing debt.
Global financial markets and economic conditions have been disrupted and volatile in recent years. Credit markets as well as the debt and equity capital markets were exceedingly distressed and at certain times in recent years it was difficult to obtain financing and the cost of any available financing increased significantly. If global financial markets and economic conditions significantly deteriorate in the future, we may experience difficulties obtaining financing commitments, including commitments to refinance our existing debt as substantial balloon payments come due under our credit facilities, in the future if lenders are unwilling to extend financing to us or unable to meet their funding obligations due to their own liquidity, capital or solvency issues. As a result, financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our future obligations as they come due. Our failure to obtain the funds for these capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. In the absence of available financing, we also may be unable to take advantage of further business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures.
Compliance with safety and other requirements imposed by classification societies may be very costly and may adversely affect our business.
The hull and machinery of every commercial LNG carrier must be classed by a classification society. The classification society certifies that the ship has been built and subsequently maintained
12

in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of that classification society. Moreover, every ship must comply with all applicable international conventions and the regulations of the ship's flag state as verified by a classification society. Finally, each ship must successfully undergo periodic surveys, including annual, intermediate and special surveys performed under the classification society's rules.
If any ship does not maintain its class, it will lose its insurance coverage and be unable to trade, and the ship's owner will be in breach of relevant covenants under its financing arrangements. Failure to maintain the class of one or more of our ships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
I f we cannot meet our charterers' quality and compliance requirements we may not be able to operate our vessels profitably which could have an adverse effect on ourfuture performance, results o f operations, cash flows andfinancial position.
Customers, and in particular those in the LNG industry, have a high and increasing focus on quality and compliance standards with their suppliers across the entire value chain, including the shipping and transportation segment. Our continuous compliance with these standards and quality requirements is vital for our operations. Related risks could materialize in multiple ways, including a sudden and unexpected breach in quality and/or compliance concerning one or more vessels, or a continuous decrease in the quality concerning one or more LNG carriers occurring over time. Moreover, continuous increasing requirements from LNG industry constituents can further complicate our ability to meet the standards. Any noncompliance by us, either suddenly or over a period of time, on one or more LNG carriers, or an increase in requirements by our charterers above and beyond what we deliver, may have a material adverse effect on our future performance, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
The LNG shipping industry is subject to substantial environmental and other regulations, which may significantly limit our operations or increase our expenses.
Our operations are materially affected by extensive and changing international, national, state and local environmental laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards which are in force in international waters, or in the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which our ships operate and in the countries in which our ships are registered. These requirements include those relating to equipping and operating ships, providing security and minimizing or addressing impacts on the environment from ship operations. We may incur substantial costs in complying with these requirements, including costs for ship modifications and changes in operating procedures. We also could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, the suspension or termination of operations and third-party claims as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, such laws and regulations.
In addition, these requirements can affect the resale value or useful lives of our ships, require a reduction in cargo capacity, necessitate ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions or lead to decreased availability of insurance coverage for environmental matters. They could further result in the denial of access to certain jurisdictional waters or ports or detention in certain ports. We are required to obtain governmental approvals and permits to operate our ships. Delays in obtaining such governmental approvals may increase our expenses, and the terms and conditions of such approvals could materially and adversely affect our operations.
Additional laws and regulations may be adopted that could limit our ability to do business or increase our operating costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business. For example, new or amended legislation relating to ship recycling, sewage systems, emission control (including emissions of greenhouse gases) as well as ballast water treatment and ballast water handling may be adopted. The United States has recently enacted ballast water management system legislation and regulations that require more stringent controls of air and water emissions from ocean-going ships. Such legislation or regulations may require additional capital expenditures or operating expenses (such as increased costs for low-sulfur fuel) in order for us to maintain our ships' compliance with
13

international and/or national regulations. We also may become subject to additional laws and regulations if we enter new markets or trades.
We also believe that the heightened environmental, quality and security concerns of insurance underwriters, regulators and charterers will generally lead to additional regulatory requirements, including enhanced risk assessment and security requirements, as well as greater inspection and safety requirements on all LNG carriers in the marine transportation market. These requirements are likely to add incremental costs to our operations, and the failure to comply with these requirements may affect the ability of our ships to obtain and, possibly, recover from, insurance or to obtain the required certificates for entry into the different ports where we operate.
Some environmental laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or "OPA", provide for potentially unlimited joint, several and/or strict liability for owners, operators and demise or bareboat charterers for oil pollution and related damages. OPA applies to discharges of any oil from a ship in U.S. waters, including discharges of fuel and lubricants from a LNG carrier, even if the ships do not carry oil as cargo. In addition, many states in the United States bordering a navigable waterway have enacted legislation providing for potentially unlimited strict liability without regard to fault for the discharge of pollutants within their waters. We also are subject to other laws and conventions outside the United States that provide for an owner or operator of LNG carriers to bear strict liability for pollution, such as the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims of 1976, or the "London Convention".
Some of these laws and conventions, including OPA and the London Convention, may include limitations on liability. However, the limitations may not be applicable in certain circumstances, such as where a spill is caused by a ship owner's or operator's intentional or reckless conduct. These limitations are also subject to periodic updates and may otherwise be amended in the future.
Compliance with OPA and other environmental laws and regulations also may result in ship owners and operators incurring increased costs for additional maintenance and inspection requirements, the development of contingency arrangements for potential spills, obtaining mandated insurance coverage and meeting financial responsibility requirements.
Climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions may adversely impact our operations and markets.
Due to concern over the risks of climate change, a number of countries and the International Maritime Organization, or "IMO", have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emission from ships. These regulatory measures may include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Although emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping currently are not subject to agreements under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, such as the "Kyoto Protocol" and the "Paris Agreement", a new treaty may be adopted in the future that includes additional restrictions on shipping emissions to those already adopted under the International Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships, or the "MARPOL Convention". Compliance with future changes in laws and regulations relating to climate change could increase the costs of operating and maintaining our ships and could require us to install new emission controls, as well as acquire allowances, pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. Revenue generation and strategic growth opportunities may also be adversely affected.
Adverse effects upon the oil and gas industry relating to climate change, including growing public concern about the environmental impact of climate change, may also have an effect on demand for our services. For example, increased regulation of greenhouse gases or other concerns relating to climate change may reduce the demand for oil and natural gas in the future or create greater incentives for use of alternative energy sources. Any long-term material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry could have significant financial and operational adverse impacts on our business that we cannot predict with certainty at this time.
14

We operate our ships worldwide, which could expose us to political, governmental and economic instability that could harm our business.
Because we operate our ships in the geographic areas where our customers do business, our operations may be affected by political, governmental and economic conditions in the countries where our ships operate or where they are registered. Any disruption caused by these factors could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. In particular, our ships frequent LNG terminals in countries including Egypt, Equatorial Guinea and Trinidad as well as transit through the Gulf of Aden and the Strait of Malacca. Economic, political and governmental conditions in these and other regions have from time to time resulted in military conflicts, terrorism, attacks on ships, mining of waterways, piracy and other efforts to disrupt shipping. Future hostilities or other political instability in the geographic regions where we operate or may operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. In addition, our business could also be harmed by tariffs, trade embargoes and other economic sanctions by the United States or other countries against countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia or elsewhere as a result of terrorist attacks, hostilities or diplomatic or political pressures that limit trading activities with those countries.
Terrorist attacks, international hostilities, political change and piracy could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results o f operations and cash flows.
Terrorist attacks, piracy and the current conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere, as well as other current and future conflicts and political change, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. The continuing hostilities in the Middle East may lead to additional acts of terrorism, further regional conflicts, other armed actions around the world and civil disturbance in the United States or elsewhere, which may contribute to further instability in the global financial markets. These uncertainties could also adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
In the past, political conflicts have also resulted in attacks on ships, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. Acts of terrorism and piracy have also affected ships trading in regions such as the South China Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Any terrorist attacks targeted at ships may in the future negatively materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders and could directly impact our ships or our customers.
We currently employ armed guards onboard certain vessels operating in areas that may be prone to hijacking or terrorist attacks. The presence of armed guards may increase the risk of damage, injury or loss of life in connection with any attacks on our vessels, in addition to increasing crew costs.
We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from acts of terrorism, piracy, regional conflicts and other armed actions, including losses relating to the employment of armed guards.
LNG facilities, shipyards, ships, pipelines and gas fields could be targets of future terrorist attacks or piracy. Any such attacks could lead to, among other things, bodily injury or loss of life, as well as damage to the ships or other property, increased ship operating costs, including insurance costs, reductions in the supply of LNG and the inability to transport LNG to or from certain locations. Terrorist attacks, war or other events beyond our control that adversely affect the production, storage or transportation of LNG to be shipped by us could entitle our customers to terminate our charter contracts in certain circumstances, which would harm our cash flows and our business.
Terrorist attacks, or the perception that LNG facilities and LNG carriers are potential terrorist targets, could materially and adversely affect expansion of LNG infrastructure and the continued supply of LNG. Concern that LNG facilities may be targeted for attack by terrorists has contributed significantly to local community and environmental group resistance to the construction of a number
15

of LNG facilities, primarily in North America. If a terrorist incident involving a LNG facility or LNG carrier did occur, in addition to the possible effects identified in the previous paragraph, the incident may adversely affect the construction of additional LNG facilities and could lead to the temporary or permanent closing of various LNG facilities currently in operation.
A cyber-attack could materially disrupt GasLog's business.
GasLog's business operations could be targeted by individuals or groups seeking to sabotage or disrupt GasLog's information technology systems and networks, or to steal data. A successful cyber-attack could materially disrupt GasLog's operations, including the safety of its operations, or lead to unauthorized release of information or alteration of information on its systems. Any such attack or other breach of GasLog's information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on GasLog's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
In the future, the ships we own or manage could be required to call on ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the United States and other governments.
The United States and other governments and their agencies impose sanctions and embargoes on certain countries and maintain lists of countries they consider to be state sponsors of terrorism. For example, in 2010, the United States enacted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act, or "CISADA", which expanded the scope of the former Iran Sanctions Act. Among other things, CISADA expanded the application of the prohibitions imposed by the U.S. government to non-U.S. companies, such as us, and limits the ability of companies and persons to do business or trade with Iran when such activities relate to the investment, supply or export of refined petroleum or petroleum products, as well as LNG.
In 2012, President Obama signed Executive Order 13608, which prohibits foreign persons from violating or attempting to violate, or causing a violation of, any sanctions in effect against Iran, or facilitating any deceptive transactions for or on behalf of any person subject to U.S. sanctions. The Secretary of the Treasury may prohibit any transactions or dealings, including any U.S. capital markets financing, involving any person found to be in violation of Executive Order 13608. Also in 2012, the U.S. enacted the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, or the "ITRA", which created new sanctions and strengthened existing sanctions. Among other things, the ITRA intensifies existing sanctions regarding the provision of goods, services, infrastructure or technology to Iran's petroleum or petrochemical sector. The ITRA also includes a provision requiring the President of the United States to impose five or more sanctions from Section 6(a) of the Iran Sanctions Act, as amended, on a person the President determines is a controlling beneficial owner of, or otherwise owns, operates, or controls or insures a vessel that was used to transport crude oil from Iran to another country and (1) if the person is a controlling beneficial owner of the vessel, the person had actual knowledge the vessel was so used or (2) if the person otherwise owns, operates, or controls, or insures the vessel, the person knew or should have known the vessel was so used. Such a person could be subject to a variety of sanctions, including exclusion from U.S. capital markets, exclusion from financial transactions subject to U.S. jurisdiction, and exclusion of such person's vessels from U.S. ports for up to two years. The ITRA also includes a requirement that issuers of securities must disclose to the SEC in their annual and quarterly reports filed after February 6, 2013 whether the issuer or "any affiliate" has "knowingly" engaged in certain sanctioned activities involving Iran during the timeframe covered by the report. Finally, in January 2013, the U.S. enacted the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 or the "IFCA", which expanded the scope of U.S. sanctions on any person that is part of Iran's energy, shipping or shipbuilding sector and operators of ports in Iran, and imposes penalties on any person who facilitates or otherwise knowingly provides significant financial, material or other support to these entities.
On January 16, 2016, the United States suspended certain sanctions against Iran applicable to non-U.S. companies, such as us, pursuant to the nuclear agreement reached between Iran, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. To
16

implement these changes, beginning on January 16, 2016, the United States waived enforcement of many of the sanctions against Iran's energy and petrochemical sectors described above, including, among other things, certain provisions of CISADA, ITRA, and IFCA. While non-U.S. companies may now engage in certain business or trade with Iran that was previously prohibited, the U.S. has the ability to reimpose sanctions against Iran if, in the future, Iran does not comply with its obligations under the nuclear agreement.
Although the ships we own and those we manage have not called on ports in countries subject to sanctions or embargoes or in countries identified as state sponsors of terrorism, including Iran, North Korea and Syria, we cannot assure you that these ships will not call on ports in these countries in the future. While we intend to maintain compliance with all sanctions and embargoes applicable to us, U.S. and international sanctions and embargo laws and regulations do not necessarily apply to the same countries or proscribe the same activities, which may make compliance difficult. Additionally, the scope of certain laws may be unclear, and these laws may be subject to changing interpretations and application and may be amended or strengthened from time to time, including by adding or removing countries from the proscribed lists. Violations of sanctions and embargo laws and regulations could result in fines or other penalties and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their investment, or not to invest, in us.
Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and other anti-bribery legislation in otherjurisdictions could result in fines, criminal penalties, contract terminations and an adverse effect on our business.
We operate our ships worldwide, requiring our ships to trade in countries known to have a reputation for corruption. We are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anti-corruption laws and have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics which is consistent and in full compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the "FCPA", and the Bribery Act 2010 of the United Kingdom or the "UK Bribery Act". We are subject, however, to the risk that we, our affiliated entities or our or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents may take actions determined to be in violation of such anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, or curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business. Furthermore, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management.
Changing laws and evolving reporting requirements could have an adverse effect on our business.
Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to reporting requirements, including the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, may create additional compliance requirements for us. To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, GasLog has invested in, and intends to continue to invest in, reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards.
The Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires any commercial organization that carries on a business or part of a business in the UK which both (i) supplies goods or services, and (ii) has an annual worldwide turnover of £36 million to prepare a slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year ending on or after March 31, 2016. In this statement, the commercial organization must set out the steps it has taken to ensure there is no modern slavery in its own business and its supply chain, or state that it has taken no such steps. The UK Secretary of State may enforce the duty to prepare a slavery and human trafficking statement by means of civil proceedings against the organization concerned. To the extent that we are found to be non-compliant, whether with or without our knowledge, we may face governmental or other regulatory claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay distributions.
17

Reliability o f suppliers may limit our ability to obtain supplies and services when needed.
We rely, and will in the future rely, on a significant supply of consumables, spare parts and equipment to operate, maintain, repair and upgrade our fleet of ships. Delays in delivery or unavailability of supplies could result in off-hire days due to consequent delays in the repair and maintenance of our fleet. This would negatively impact our revenues and cash flows. Cost increases could also negatively impact our future operations, although the impact of significant cost increases may be mitigated to some extent with respect to the vessels that are employed under charter contracts with automatic periodic adjustment provisions or cost review provisions.
Governments could requisition our ships during a period o f war or emergency, resulting in loss o f earnings.
The government o f a jurisdiction where one or more o f our ships are registered could requisition for title or seize our ships. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a ship and becomes its owner. Also, a government could requisition our ships for hire. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a ship and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency, although governments may elect to requisition ships in other circumstances. Although we would expect to be entitled to government compensation in the event of a requisition of one or more of our ships, the amount and timing of payments, if any, would be uncertain. A government requisition of one or more of our ships would result in off-hire days under our time charters and may cause us to breach covenants in certain of our credit facilities, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
Maritime claimants could arrest our ships, which could interrupt our cash flows.
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a ship, shippers or receivers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a ship for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lienholder may enforce its lien by arresting a ship. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our ships which is not timely discharged could cause us to default on a charter or breach covenants in certain of our credit facilities and, to the extent such arrest or attachment is not covered by our protection and indemnity insurance, could require us to pay large sums of money to have the arrest or attachment lifted. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
Additionally, in some jurisdictions, such as the Republic of South Africa, under the "sister ship" theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the ship that is subject to the claimant's maritime lien and any "associated" ship, which is any ship owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert "sister ship" liability against one ship in our fleet for claims relating to another of our ships.
We may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on us.
We may in the future be involved from time to time in litigation matters. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, toxic tort claims, employment matters and governmental claims for taxes or duties, as well as other litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any claim or other litigation matter. The ultimate outcome of any litigation matter and the potential costs associated with prosecuting or defending such lawsuits, including the diversion of management's attention to these matters, could have an adverse effect on us and, in the event of litigation that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us, could lead to an event of default under certain of our credit facilities.
18

Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us
Any limitation in the availability or operation o f our ships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results o f operations and cash flows.
Our owned fleet consists of 22 LNG carriers that are in operation (including the nine LNG carriers owned by GasLog Partners) and five newbuildings on order. If any of our vessels is unable to generate revenues for any significant period of time for any reason, including unexpected periods of off-hire, early charter termination (which could result from damage to our vessels) or failure to secure employment for any vessels for which we have not secured charters, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, could be materially and adversely affected. The impact of any limitation in the operation of our vessels or any early charter termination would be amplified during the period prior to delivery of our newbuildings, as a substantial portion of our cash flows and income are dependent on the revenues earned by the chartering of our 22 LNG carriers in operation. In addition, the costs of vessel repairs are unpredictable and can be substantial. In the event of repair costs that are not covered by our insurance policies, we may have to pay for such repair costs, which would decrease our earnings and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
We depend upon one customerfo r nearly all o f our revenues. This customer was recently acquired by another energy company which could impact our ability to maintain our relationship with this customer. The loss o f this customer would result in a significant loss o f revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results o f operations and cash flows.
We have historically derived nearly all of our revenues from one customer, MSL, a subsidiary of BG Group and a subsidiary of Shell. For the year ended December 31, 2016, MSL and other subsidiaries of Shell accounted for 84.30% and 10.66% of our revenues, respectively. Following the delivery of our five new LNG carriers on order, MSL will continue to be a key customer, as three of our newbuildings will be chartered to MSL upon delivery for a total of 19 owned vessels chartered to MSL. Although MSL's contractual obligations under the charter agreements are not impacted by the acquisition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain the same business relationship with MSL following its integration into Shell. In addition, the combination of BG Group and Shell has increased our customer concentration because all of our on the water vessels that are on multi-year contracts are now chartered to subsidiaries of Shell. Furthermore, we could lose a customer or the benefits of our time charter or ship management arrangements for many different reasons, including if the customer is unable or unwilling to make charter hire or other payments to us because of a deterioration in its financial condition, disagreements with us or otherwise. If our customer terminates its charters, chooses not to re-charter our ships after the initial charter terms or is unable to perform under its charters and we are not able to find replacement charters on similar terms, we will suffer a loss of revenues that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. Our revenues would also be impacted if MSL terminates or is unable to perform under our ship management contracts.
Any charter termination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results o f operations and cash flows.
Our charterers have the right to terminate a ship's time charter in certain circumstances, such as:
· loss of the ship or damage to it beyond repair;
· if the ship is off-hire for any reason other than scheduled dry-docking for a period exceeding 90 consecutive days, or for more than 90 days or 110 days, depending on the charter, in any one-year period;
· defaults by us in our obligations under the charter; or
19

· the outbreak of war or hostilities involving two or more major nations, such as the United States or the People's Republic of China, that would materially and adversely affect the trading of the ship for a period of at least 30 days.
A termination right under one ship's time charter would not automatically give the charterer the right to terminate its other charter contracts with us. However, a charter termination could materially affect our relationship with the customer and our reputation in the LNG shipping industry, and in some circumstances the event giving rise to the termination right could potentially impact multiple charters. Accordingly, the existence of any right of termination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
If we lose a charter, we may be unable to obtain a new time charter on terms as favorable to us or with a charterer of comparable standing, particularly if we are seeking new time charters at a time when charter rates in the LNG industry are depressed. Consequently, we may have an increased exposure to the volatile spot market, which is highly competitive and subject to significant price fluctuations. In the event that we are unable to re-deploy a ship for which a charter has been terminated, we will not receive any revenues from that ship, and we may be required to pay expenses necessary to maintain the ship in proper operating condition. In addition, in the event of a charter termination we could be required under certain of our credit facilities to deposit cash in an account held with the applicable lender until we have obtained a new time charter on terms acceptable to such lender, or under some other of our credit facilities repay the outstanding loan amount, which could restrict our cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
Our ship management agreements may be terminated with limited advance notice.
Unlike our time charters, our ship management agreements with MSL and Egypt LNG may be terminated at any time by either party with a short period of advance notice. In the event that a ship management agreement is terminated by MSL other than in connection with the sale of a ship, MSL would generally be entitled to immediately terminate the ship management agreements for the other ships we manage on its behalf. If a customer were to terminate our ship management agreements, we may be unable to find new customers for our ship management services or we may choose not to continue providing ship management services to third-party customers, which could adversely impact our revenues and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
Due to our lack o f diversification, adverse developments in the LNG transportation industry could adversely affect our business, particularly if such developments occur at a time when we are seeking a new charter.
We rely exclusively on cash flow generated from charters for our LNG vessels and management of third party LNG vessels. Due to our lack of diversification, an adverse development in the LNG transportation industry could have a significantly greater impact on our business, particularly if such developments occur at a time when our ships are not under charter or nearing the end of their charters, than if we maintained more diverse assets or lines of businesses.
Our contracts fo r the five newbuildings we have on order are subject to risks that could cause delays in the delivery o f the ships, which could adversely affect our results o f operations and cash flows.
Our five contracted newbuildings are scheduled to be delivered to us on various dates between 2018 and 2019. Significant delays in the delivery of one or more of these ships, which are expected to generate a substantial portion of our contracted revenue in future years, would delay our receipt of revenues under the related time charters. For prolonged delays, the customer may terminate the charter and, in addition to the resulting loss of revenues, we may be responsible for additional substantial liquidated damages, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. In addition,
20

the delivery of any of these ships with substantial defects or unexpected operational problems could have similar consequences.
The completion of newbuildings could be delayed because of: · shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor; · delays in the receipt of necessary construction materials, such as steel, or equipment, such as engines or generators; · failure of equipment to meet quality and/or performance standards; · the shipyards over-committing to new ships to be constructed; · changes in governmental regulations or maritime self-regulatory organization standards; · political or economic disturbances; · financial or operating difficulties experienced by equipment vendors or the shipyards; · requests for changes to the original vessel specifications; · inability to obtain required permits or approvals; · disputes with the shipyards; · inability to finance the construction or conversion of the vessels; · work stoppages and other labor disputes; and · adverse weather conditions or any other events of force majeure, including war or hostilities between South Korea, where we have ships on
order at Samsung and Hyundai, and North Korea.
If delivery of a vessel is materially delayed, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
As we take delivery o f our newbuildings or any secondhand ships we acquire in the future, we will need to expand our staff and crew. I f we cannot recruit and retain employees and provide adequate compensation, our business, financial condition, results o f operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.
Our ability to acquire and retain customers depends on a number of factors, including our ability to man our vessels with masters, officers and crews of suitable experience in operating LNG carriers. As we take delivery of our newbuildings or any secondhand ships we acquire in the future, we expect to hire a significant number of seafarers qualified to man and operate our new vessels, as well as additional shoreside personnel. As the global LNG carrier fleet continues to grow, we expect the demand for technically skilled and experienced officers and crew to increase. This could lead to an industry-wide shortfall of qualified personnel, resulting in increased crew costs, which could constrain our ability to recruit suitable employees to operate our LNG carriers within our budget parameters.
Material increases in crew costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. In addition, if we cannot recruit and retain sufficient numbers of quality on-board seafaring personnel, we may not be able to fully utilize our expanded fleet, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
We must make substantial capital expenditures to acquire the five newbuildings we have on order and any additional ships we may acquire in the future.
We are obligated to make substantial capital expenditures to fund our commitments for the five newbuildings we have on order. We are scheduled to take delivery of the vessels on various dates between 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2016, the total remaining balance of the contract prices
21

for the five vessels was $0.95 billion, which amounts are payable under each shipbuilding contract in installments upon the attainment of certain specified milestones. The largest portion of the purchase price for each vessel will come due upon its delivery to us from the shipyard. We intend to fund these commitments with the undrawn $664.03 million under the financing agreement we entered into on October 16, 2015 (the "October 2015 Facility"), available cash and cash from operations.
To the extent that we are unable to draw down the amounts committed under our credit facilities, whether due to our failure to comply with the terms of such facilities or the lenders' failure to fund the committed amounts, we will need to find alternative financing. If we are unable to find alternative financing, we will not be capable of funding all of our commitments for capital expenditures relating to our five contracted newbuildings. In the event that we fail to meet our payment obligations under a shipbuilding contract, we would be in default under the applicable contract and the shipbuilder would have the option of cancelling the contract and retaining any previously funded installment payments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
In addition, we may choose to make substantial capital expenditures to expand the size of our fleet in the future. We expect to finance the cost of any new vessels through available cash, cash from operations and debt or equity financings. Our ability to obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering, as well as by adverse market conditions resulting from, among other things, general economic conditions, changes in the LNG industry and further contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Even if we are successful in obtaining necessary funds, the terms of any debt financings could limit our ability to further expand our fleet and to pay dividends to our shareholders.
We may have difficulty further expanding ourfleet in the future.
We may expand our fleet beyond our contracted newbuildings by ordering additional newbuildings or by making selective acquisitions of highquality secondhand vessels to the extent that they are available in the same way that we acquired the GasLog Chelsea and the eight vessels acquired from MSL in 2014 and 2015. Our future growth will depend on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including our ability to:
· identify attractive ship acquisition opportunities and consummate such acquisitions; · obtain newbuilding contracts at acceptable prices; · obtain required equity and debt financing on acceptable terms; · secure charter arrangements on terms acceptable to our lenders; · expand our relationships with existing customers and establish new customer relationships; · recruit and retain additional suitably qualified and experienced seafarers and shore-based employees; · continue to meet technical and safety performance standards; · manage joint ventures; and · manage the expansion of our operations to integrate the new ships into our fleet.
We may not be successful in executing any future growth plans, and we cannot give any assurances that we will not incur significant expenses and losses in connection with such growth efforts.
Our credit facilities are secured by our ships and contain payment obligations and restrictive covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities as well as our ability to pay
22

dividends. A failure by us to meet our obligations under our creditfacilities could result in an event o f default under such creditfacilities and foreclosure on our ships.
Our credit facilities impose, and any future credit facility we enter into will impose, operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These restrictions in our credit facilities generally limit our shipowning subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:
· incur additional indebtedness, create liens or provide guarantees;
· provide any form of credit or financial assistance to, or enter into any non-arms' length transactions with, us or any of our affiliates;
· sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including our ships;
· engage in merger transactions;
· enter into, terminate or amend any charter;
· amend our shipbuilding contracts;
· change the manager of our ships;
· undergo a change in ownership; or
· acquire assets, make investments or enter into any joint venture arrangements outside of the ordinary course of business.
Our credit facilities also impose certain restrictions relating to us and our other subsidiaries, including restrictions that limit our ability to make any substantial change in the nature of our business or to engage in transactions that would constitute a change of control, as defined in the relevant credit facility, without repaying all of our indebtedness in full.
Our credit facilities also impose specified financial covenants that apply to us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or, in the case of the GasLog Partners' $450.0 million credit facility, or the "GasLog Partners Credit Facility", to GasLog Partners and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, or in the case of the credit facility provided under the credit agreement entered into on February 18, 2016 to refinance the existing indebtedness on five of our contracted vessels of up to $576.50 million, or the "Five Vessel Refinancing", to us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and to GasLog Partners and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These financial covenants generally include the following:
· net working capital (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) must be not less than $0 (not included in the GasLog Partners financial covenants);
· total indebtedness divided by our total assets must not exceed 75.0% (in the case of the GasLog Partners financial covenants, must be less than 60.0%);
· the ratio of EBITDA over our debt service obligations (including interest and debt repayments) on a trailing 12 months basis must be not less than 110.0%;
· the aggregate amount of all unencumbered cash and cash equivalents must be not less than the higher of 3.0% of total indebtedness and $50.0 million ($15.0 million under the GasLog Partners financial covenants);
· being permitted to pay dividends, provided that unencumbered cash and cash equivalents equal to at least 4.0% of total indebtedness, subject to no event of default having occurred or occurring as a consequence of the payment of such dividends (in the case of the GasLog Partners financial covenants, being permitted to pay dividends subject to no event of default having occurred or resulting from such payment); and
· market value adjusted net worth must be not less than $350.0 million (not included in the GasLog Partners financial covenants).
In addition, our credit facilities contain covenants requiring us and certain of our subsidiaries to maintain the aggregate of (i) the market value, on a charter exclusive basis, of the mortgaged vessel or vessels and (ii) the market value of any additional security provided to the lenders, not less than 120.0% (in the case of the October 2015 Facility, 115.0% for the first two years after each drawdown and 120.0% at any time thereafter and in the case of the Five Vessel Refinancing,
23

115.0% until the maturity of the junior tranche and 120.0% at any time thereafter) of the then outstanding amount under the applicable facility. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are not able to obtain covenant waivers or modifications, our lenders could require us to make prepayments or provide additional collateral sufficient to bring us into compliance with such covenants, and if we fail to do so our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness.
Further, GasLog has two NOK denominated bonds which also impose specified financial covenants that apply to it and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Under the NOK denominated bond agreement signed on June 25, 2013, between GasLog Ltd. and the bond trustee, as amended, or the "2018 Bond Agreement", GasLog is required to comply with the following financial covenants:
· GasLog's total indebtedness divided by its total assets must not exceed 75.0%;
· the ratio of EBITDA over GasLog's debt service obligations (including interest and debt repayments) on a trailing 12 months basis must be not less than 110.0%;
· the aggregate amount of all unencumbered cash and cash equivalents must be not less than the higher of 3.0% of GasLog's total indebtedness and $20.0 million after the first drawdown; and
· GasLog's market value adjusted net worth must at all times be not less than $350.0 million.
The 2018 Bond Agreement also includes a dividend restriction according to which GasLog may not (i) declare or make any dividend payment or distribution, whether in cash or in kind, (ii) repurchase any of GasLog's shares or undertake other similar transactions (including, but not limited to, total return swaps related to GasLog's shares), or (iii) grant any loans or make other distributions or transactions constituting a transfer of value to GasLog's shareholders (items (i), (ii) and (iii) collectively referred to as the "Distributions") that in aggregate exceed during any calendar year 50.0% of GasLog's consolidated net profit after taxes based on the audited annual accounts for the previous financial year (any unutilized portion of the permitted dividend pursuant to the above may not be carried forward). Notwithstanding the above, GasLog is permitted to make Distributions up to an aggregate maximum per share, for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 of $1.10/share, $1.20/share and $1.30/share, respectively, provided that total indebtedness divided by total assets (giving pro forma effect for the distribution) does not exceed 67.5% immediately after the Distribution is made, the ratio of EBITDA over debt service obligations on a trailing 12 months basis ending the quarter immediately prior to that in which the Distribution is made is not less than 115.0% and no event of default would result from such distribution. The 2018 Bond Agreement also prohibits GasLog from providing any debt or committed debt availability to GasLog Partners in excess of $75.0 million.
Under the NOK denominated bond agreement signed on June 22, 2016, between GasLog Ltd. and the bond trustee, as amended, or the "2021 Bond Agreement", GasLog is required to comply with the following financial covenants:
· net working capital (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) must be not less than $0;
· total indebtedness divided by total assets must not exceed 75.0%;
· the ratio of EBITDA over debt service obligations (including interest and debt repayments) on a trailing 12 months basis must be not less than 110.0% ;
· the aggregate amount of all unencumbered cash and cash equivalents must be not less than the higher of 3.0% of total indebtedness and $50.0 million;
· GasLog is permitted to pay dividends, provided that it holds unencumbered cash and cash equivalents equal to at least 4.0% of total indebtedness, subject to no event of default having occurred or occurring as a consequence of the payment of such dividends; and
· GasLog's market value adjusted net worth must at all times be not less than $350.0 million.
In addition, the 2021 Bond Agreement includes a dividend restriction according to which GasLog may not (i) declare or make any dividend payment or distribution, whether in cash or in kind, (ii) re-purchase any of GasLog's shares or undertake other similar transactions (including, but
24

not limited to, total return swaps related to GasLog's shares), or (in) grant any loans or make other distributions or transactions constituting a transfer of value to GasLog's shareholders (items (i), (ii) and (iii) collectively referred to as the "Distributions") that in aggregate exceed during any calendar year, 50% of GasLog's consolidated net profit after taxes based on the audited annual accounts for the previous financial year (any unutilized portion of the permitted Distributions pursuant to the above may not be carried forward). For the purposes of the above, the consolidated net profit after taxes of GasLog shall not include any profits related to the sale of assets (and consequently any such profits related to such profits shall not form the basis for Distributions). Under the 2021 Bond Agreement GasLog is permitted to make Distributions up to a maximum amount per share per annum for the years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 of $1.00/share, $1.10/share, $1.10/share, $1.20/share, $1.20/share and $1.20/share, respectively, provided that GasLog can demonstrate by delivering a compliance certificate to the bond trustee that no event of default is continuing or would result from such Distributions.
Certain of our credit facilities also contain vessel employment conditions, pursuant to which we could be required in the event of a charter termination or in certain other circumstances to deposit cash in an account held with the applicable lender until we have obtained a new time charter on terms acceptable to such lender, or under certain of our credit facilities repay the outstanding loan amount.
Our ability to comply with covenants and restrictions contained in our financing arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. A failure to comply with covenants and restrictions or to meet our payment and other obligations could lead to defaults under our credit facilities which could cause our payment obligations to be accelerated. We may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. Because obligations under our financing arrangements are secured by our ships and are guaranteed by our ship-owning subsidiaries, if we are unable to repay debt under our financing arrangements, the lenders could seek to foreclose on those assets, which would materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. In addition, a default under one of our credit facilities could result in the cross-acceleration of our other indebtedness. For more information regarding our credit facilities, please read "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-- B. Liquidity and Capital Resources--Credit Facilities".
The significant global natural gas and crude oil price volatility, amongst other factors referenced above, have in turn led to a significant shortening of the average duration of spot charters fixed during 2016, as well as a significant decline in average rates for new spot and shorter-term LNG charters commencing promptly. Over the next 18 months, unless LNG charter market conditions improve, we may have difficulty in securing new charters at attractive rates and durations for the five vessels in the Cool Pool. As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 1,978 open vessel days during 2017, including 1,825 days for the five vessels operating in the Cool Pool. A failure to obtain charters at acceptable rates on these vessels could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, as well as our ability to meet certain of our debt covenants later in 2017, particularly the required ratio of EBITDA to debt service and the minimum cash requirement.
Ship values may fluctuate substantially, which could result in an impairment charge, could impact our compliance with the covenants in our loan agreements and, i f the values are lower at a time when we are attempting to dispose o f ships, could cause us to incur a loss.
Values for ships can fluctuate substantially over time due to a number of different factors, including:
· prevailing economic conditions in the natural gas and energy markets;
· a substantial or extended decline in demand for LNG;
· the level of worldwide LNG production and exports;
· changes in the supply-demand balance of the global LNG carrier fleet;
25

· changes in prevailing charter hire rates;
· the physical condition of the ship;
· the size, age and technical specifications of the ship;
· demand for LNG carriers; and
· the cost of retrofitting or modifying existing ships, as a result of technological advances in ship design or equipment, changes in applicable environmental or other regulations or standards, customer requirements or otherwise.
If the market value of our ships declines, we may be required to record an impairment charge in our financial statements, which could adversely affect our results of operations. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects -B. Liquidity and Capital Resourced--Critical Accounting Policies--Impairment of Vessels". In addition, any such deterioration in market value of our ships may trigger a breach of some of the covenants contained in our credit facilities. If we do breach such covenants and we are unable to remedy the relevant breach, our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness and seek to foreclose on the ships in our fleet securing those credit facilities. In addition, if a charter contract expires or is terminated by the customer, we may be unable to re-deploy the affected ships at attractive rates and, rather than continue to incur costs to maintain and finance them, we may seek to dispose of them. Any foreclosure on our ships, or any disposal by us of a ship at a time when ship prices have fallen, could result in a loss and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
Our debt levels may limit ourflexibility in obtaining additionalfinancing, pursuing other business opportunities and paying dividends to our shareholders.
As of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of $2.65 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our credit agreements and Bonds, of which $147.45 million was repayable within one year, and a $220.40 million finance lease liability related to the sale and leaseback of the Methane Julia Louise, of which $5.95 million was repayable within one year. As of December 31, 2016 there was an undrawn available capacity of $88.4 million under the revolving facility of the credit agreement we entered into on July 19, 2016 to refinance the existing indebtedness on eight of our on-thewater vessels of up to $1,050.0 million (the "Legacy Facility Refinancing"). In addition, there is one loan facility with an aggregate undrawn amount of $664.03 million available that will be used to finance a portion of the contract price of four of our five newbuildings on their delivery. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future as we grow our fleet. This level of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following:
· our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, ship acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;
· our costs of borrowing could increase as we become more leveraged;
· we will need a substantial portion of our cash flow to make principal and interest payments on our debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and dividends to our shareholders;
· our debt level may make us more vulnerable than our competitors with less debt to competitive pressures or a downturn in our industry or the economy generally; and
· our debt level may limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.
Our ability to service our debt depends upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital
26

or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms, or at all.
Our ability to obtain additional debtfinancing fo r future acquisitions o f ships or to refinance our existing debt may depend on the creditworthiness o f our charterers and the terms o f ourfuture charters.
Our ability to borrow against the ships in our existing fleet and any ships we may acquire in the future largely depends on the value of the ships, which in turn depends in part on charter hire rates and the ability of our charterers to comply with the terms of their charters. The actual or perceived credit quality of our charterers, and any defaults by them, may materially affect our ability to obtain the additional capital resources that we will require to purchase additional ships and to refinance our existing debt as balloon payments come due, or may significantly increase our costs of obtaining such capital. Our inability to obtain additional financing or committing to financing on unattractive terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
Our ability to pay dividends or to redeem our Preference Shares may be limited by the amount o f cash we generate front operations, by restrictions in our creditfacilities and by additional factors unrelated to our profitability.
We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends. The declaration and payment of any dividend (including cumulative dividends payable with respect to our Preference Shares) is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and the requirements of Bermuda law. The timing and amount of any dividend or redemption payments will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, restrictions in our debt agreements, the provisions of Bermuda law and other factors. The amount of cash we generate from operations and the actual amount of cash we will have available for dividends or to redeem our Preference Shares will vary based upon, among other things:
· general LNG shipping market conditions and trends, including charter rates, ship values, factors affecting supply and demand, technological advancements and opportunities for the profitable operations of LNG carriers;
· our ability to comply with the specified financial covenants in our loan facilities and the Bonds and as corporate guarantor for certain loan facilities on a consolidated basis;
· our ability to obtain new charters for our vessels at favourable rates; · the charter hire payments we obtain from our charters as well as our ability to re-charter the vessels and the rates obtained upon the expiration
of our existing charters; · our fleet expansion and associated uses of our cash as well as any financing requirements; · the due performance by our charterers of their obligations; · delays in the delivery of newbuild vessels and the beginning of payments under charters relating to those vessels; · the level of our operating costs, such as the costs of crews, lubricants and insurance, as well as the costs of repairs, maintenance or
modifications of our ships; · the number of unscheduled off-hire days for our fleet and the timing of, and number of days required for, scheduled dry-docking of our ships; · our ability to obtain financing to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate activities, funding by banks of their financial
commitments, and our ability to meet our obligations under our credit facilities; · prevailing global and regional economic or political conditions; · changes in interest rates;
27

· the effect of governmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization standards on the conduct of our business;
· changes in the basis of taxation of our activities in various jurisdictions;
· modification or revocation of our dividend policy by our board of directors; and
· the amount of any cash reserves established by our board of directors.
For information regarding the dividend payment restrictions in our financing agreements, see "--Risks Related to Our Business--Our credit facilities are secured by our ships and contain payment obligations and restrictive covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities as well as our ability to pay dividends. A failure by us to meet our obligations under our credit facilities could result in an event of default under such credit facilities and foreclosure on our ships."
The amount of cash we generate from our operations may differ materially from our profit or loss for the period, which will be affected by non cash items. We may incur other expenses or liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the cash available for dividends.
Under Bermuda law, a company may not declare or pay dividends if there are reasonable grounds for believing that: (i) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (ii) the realizable value of the company's assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. Under our bye-laws, each common share is entitled to dividends as and when any such dividends are declared by our board of directors.
As a result of these and the other factors mentioned above, we may pay dividends during periods when we record losses and may not pay dividends during periods when we record a profit. We can give no assurance that dividends will be paid in the future.
We are a holding company and we depend on the ability o f our subsidiaries, including GasLog Partners, to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy ourfinancial obligations and to make dividend payments.
We are a holding company. Our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own all of our operating assets, including our ships. As of February 27, 2017, we have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our subsidiaries, including GasLog Partners, in which we hold a 27.57% equity interest (including our 2.0% general partner interest) as well as all of the incentive distribution rights. As a result, our ability to pay our obligations and to make dividend payments depends entirely on our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us, including cash distributions and management and administrative services fees received from GasLog Partners. The ability of a subsidiary to make these distributions could be affected by a claim or other action by a third party, including a creditor, or by the law of its jurisdiction of incorporation which regulates the payment of dividends. Other factors which may impact the value of our equity interest in GasLog Partners and its ability to distribute funds to us are described in its public filings with the SEC. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, our board of directors may exercise its discretion not to declare or pay dividends.
Fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates could result in financial lossesfo r us.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates may have an impact on our financial performance. We receive virtually all of our revenues in dollars, while some of our operating expenses, including employee costs and certain crew costs, are denominated in euros. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk. However, we also maintain cash balances in euros, which amounted to approximately $14.08 million as of December 31, 2016. We monitor exchange rate fluctuations on a continuous basis and we also hedge movements in currency exchange rates. However, there is still a risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
In addition, we are exposed to a market risk relating to fluctuations in interest rates because our credit facilities bear interest costs at a floating rate based on London Interbank Offered Rate,
28

or "LIBOR". Significant increases in LIBOR could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders and ability to service our debt. We use interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk, and hedge a portion of our outstanding indebtedness. There is no assurance that our derivative contracts will provide adequate protection against adverse changes in interest rates or that our bank counterparties will be able to perform their obligations.
The derivative contracts used to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates could result in reductions in our shareholders' equity as well as charges against our profit.
We enter into interest rate swaps from time to time for purposes of managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates applicable to floating rate indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, we had 15 interest rate swaps in place with a notional amount of $870.0 million. The changes in the fair value of the 15 derivative contracts that have not been designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recognized in our statement of profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of any derivative contracts that do not qualify for treatment as cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes would affect, among other things, our profit, earnings per share and compliance with the market value adjusted net worth covenants in our credit facilities.
As of December 31, 2016, we had six Cross Currency Swaps, or "CCSs", to exchange interest payments and principal on maturity on the same terms as the Bonds, in order to hedge the variability of the functional currency equivalent cash flows on the Bonds. As of December 31, 2016, the six CCSs had a notional amount of $159.05 million and qualified as cash flow hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of CCSs is recognized in other comprehensive income while the ineffective portion impacts the statement of profit or loss for the period.
We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts from time to time for purposes of managing our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates applicable to payments in foreign currencies (mainly euros and British Pounds Sterling). As of December 31, 2016, we had 36 forward foreign exchange contracts in place with an aggregate notional amount of 43.2 million and 12 with an aggregate notional amount of £6.2 million. The changes in the fair value of these 48 contracts that have not been designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recognized in our statement of profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of any derivative contracts that do not qualify for treatment as cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes would affect, among other things, our profit, earnings per share and compliance with the market value adjusted net worth covenants in our credit facilities.
There is no assurance that our derivative contracts will provide adequate protection against adverse changes in interest rates or that our bank counterparties will be able to perform their obligations. In addition, as a result of the implementation of new regulation of the swaps markets in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere over the next few years, the cost and availability of interest rate and currency hedges may increase or suitable hedges may not be available.
Our earnings and business are subject to the credit risk associated with our contractual counterparties.
We enter into, among other things, time charters, ship management agreements and other contracts with our customers, shipbuilding contracts and refund guarantees relating to newbuildings, credit facilities and commitment letters with banks, insurance contracts and interest rate swaps. Such agreements subject us to counterparty credit risk. The ability and willingness of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with us will depend upon a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the natural gas and LNG markets and charter hire rates. Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under agreements with us, we could sustain significant losses which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.
29

Our business depends on certain o f our senior executives who are subject to increasing demands as a result o f our growth and who may not necessarily continue to workfo r us.
Increasing demands are placed on our management as a result of our growth. As we expand operations, we must monitor our operations, control costs and maintain quality control. In addition, the provision of management services to our publicly traded subsidiary, GasLog Partners, has increased the complexity of our business and placed additional demands on our management. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and the efforts of our Chairman, Peter G. Livanos, and certain of our senior executives. Mr. Livanos has substantial experience in the shipping industry and has worked with us for many years. He and certain of our senior executives are important to the execution of our business strategies and to the growth and development of our business. If Mr. Livanos or one or more of our senior executives ceased to be affiliated with us, we may be unable to recruit other employees with equivalent talent and experience, and our business and financial condition could suffer.
We are a partial owner o f Egypt LNG. The dividends we receive on account o f our ownership interest may decline in the future and we may have to write down the value o f our investment.
We currently own a 25.0% stake in Egypt LNG, an entity whose principal asset is the LNG carrier M e th a n e N ile E a g le , which is currently operating under a 20-year time charter with MSL. On October 29, 2015, Egypt LNG and BG Group mutually agreed to lay up the M e th a n e N ile E a g le for a period of approximately one year. The charterer continued to pay charter hire costs adjusted for net savings in operating expenses and insurance as a result of the vessel being laid up. The M e th a n e N ile E a g le was re-activated on October 15, 2016.
The declaration and payment of dividends by Egypt LNG is subject to the discretion of its board of directors, which we do not control, as well as other restrictions, including a minimum cash reserve requirement. As a result, the dividends we receive on account of our ownership interest may decline in the future, which would adversely impact our cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. In the event of an adverse change in the operating results of Egypt LNG resulting from, among other things, unscheduled off-hire days, damage to or loss of the M e th a n e N ile E a g le or early termination of the ship's charter, we would expect the amount of dividends we receive to be reduced or eliminated, and we may be required to record an impairment of our investment. The loss may limit our ability to borrow against our assets for future credit and could also adversely affect our share price. In addition, we have entered into a shareholders' agreement with the other shareholders of Egypt LNG that imposes restrictions, including preemption rights, on each party's ability to transfer, grant any security interest over or otherwise dispose of its ownership interest.
Risks Related to Our Securities
The price o f our equity securities may be volatile.
The price of our equity securities may be volatile and may fluctuate due to factors including: · actual or anticipated fluctuations in quarterly and annual results; · fluctuations in the seaborne transportation industry, including fluctuations in the LNG carrier market; · mergers and strategic alliances in the shipping industry; · changes in governmental regulations or maritime self-regulatory organizations standards; · shortfalls in our operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts; · our payment of dividends; · announcements concerning us or our competitors; · the failure of securities analysts to publish research about us, or analysts making changes in their financial estimates;
30

· general economic conditions;
· terrorist acts; · future sales of our shares or other securities; · investors' perceptions of us and the LNG shipping industry; · our payment of cash dividends to our shareholders; · the general state of the securities markets; and · other developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors.
Securities markets worldwide are experiencing significant price and volume fluctuations. The market price for our common shares may also be volatile. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common shares despite our operating performance.
Increases in interest rates may cause the market price o f our securities to decline.
An increase in interest rates may cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity investments in general. Any such increase in interest rates may result in a reduction in demand for our securities resulting from other relatively more attractive investment opportunities and may cause the trading price of our securities to decline.
We are a "foreign private issuer" under NYSE rules, and as such we are entitled to exemption from certain NYSE corporate governance standards, and you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders o f companies that are subject to all o f the NYSE corporate governance requirements.
We are a "foreign private issuer" under the securities laws of the United States and the rules of the NYSE. Under the securities laws of the United States, "foreign private issuers" are subject to different disclosure requirements than U.S. domiciled registrants, as well as different financial reporting requirements. Under the NYSE rules, a "foreign private issuer" is subject to less stringent corporate governance requirements. Subject to certain exceptions, the rules of the NYSE permit a "foreign private issuer" to follow its home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of the NYSE, including (i) the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (ii) the requirement that the nominating/corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors and have a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities, (in) the requirement that the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors and have a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities and (iv) the requirement of an annual performance evaluation of the nominating/corporate governance and compensation committees.
As permitted by these exemptions, as well as by our bye-laws and the laws of Bermuda, we have one or more non-independent directors serving as committee members on our compensation committee and our corporate governance and nominating committee. As a result, non-independent directors may, among other things, participate in fixing the compensation of our management, making share and option awards and resolving governance issues regarding our Company.
Accordingly, in the future you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.
Future sales o f our equity securities could cause the market price o f our equity securities to decline.
Sales of a substantial number of our equity securities in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, may depress the market price for our equity securities. These sales could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities in the future.
In the future we may issue additional equity securities which may be pari passu with or senior to our common shares. The issuance by us of additional common shares or other equity securities
31

that are contractually or structurally pari passu with or senior to our common shares would have the following effects:
· our shareholders' proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;
· the dividend amount payable per share on our common shares may be lower;
· the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common share may be diminished; and
· the market price of our common shares may decline.
Our shareholders also may elect to sell large numbers of equity securities held by them from time to time. The number of our equity securities available for sale in the public market will be limited by restrictions applicable under securities laws.
Our Preference Shares are subordinated to our debt obligations and investors' interests could be diluted by the issuance o f additional preference shares and by other transactions.
Our Preference Shares are subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had an average of $2.45 billion of outstanding indebtedness. Our existing indebtedness restricts, and our future indebtedness may include restrictions on, our ability to pay dividends to shareholders. Our memorandum of association and bye-laws currently authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number of preference shares out of the 500,000,000 shares of share capital in one or more classes or series. The issuance of additional preference shares on a parity with or senior to our Preference Shares would dilute the interests of the holders of our Preference Shares, and any issuance of preference shares senior to or on a parity with our Preference Shares or of additional indebtedness could affect our ability to pay dividends on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on our Preference Shares. No provisions relating to our Preference Shares protect the holders of our Preference Shares in the event of a highly leveraged or other transaction, including the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all our assets or business, which might adversely affect the holders of our Preference Shares.
Our Preference Shares rank pari passu with any other class or series of shares established after the original issue date of the Preference Shares that is not expressly subordinated or senior to the Preference Shares as to the payment of dividends and amounts payable upon liquidation or reorganization. If less than all dividends payable with respect to the Preference Shares and any parity securities are paid, any partial payment shall be made pro rata with respect to shares of Preference Shares and any parity securities entitled to a dividend payment at such time in proportion to the aggregate amounts remaining due in respect of such shares at such time.
Holders o f our Preference Shares have extremely limited voting rights.
Our common shares are the only class of our shares carrying full voting rights. Holders of the Preference Shares generally have no voting rights. However, if and whenever dividends payable on the Preference Shares are in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of Preference Shares (voting together as a class with all other classes or series of parity securities upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to elect one additional director to serve on our board of directors, and the size of our board of directors will be increased as needed to accommodate such change (unless the size of our board of directors already has been increased by reason of the election of a director by holders of parity securities upon which like voting rights have been conferred and with which the Preference Shares voted as a class for the election of such director). The right of such holders of Preference Shares to elect a member of our board of directors will continue until such time as all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Preference Shares have been paid in full. In addition, holders of Preference Shares are entitled to vote together with holders of common shares on matters related to the approval of an amalgamation or merger.
32

The Preference Shares represent perpetual equity interests and holders have no right to receive any greater payment than the liquidation preference regardless o f the circumstances.
The Preference Shares represent perpetual equity interests in us and, unlike our indebtedness, will not give rise to a claim for payment of a principal amount at a particular date. As a result, holders of the Preference Shares may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Preference Shares for an indefinite period of time.
The payment due to a holder of Preference Shares upon a liquidation is fixed at the redemption preference of $25.00 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to the date of liquidation. If, in the case of our liquidation, there are remaining assets to be distributed after payment of this amount, holders of Preference Shares will have no right to receive or to participate in these amounts. Furthermore, if the market price for Preference Shares is greater than the liquidation preference, holders of Preference Shares will have no right to receive the market price from us upon our liquidation.
Entities controlled by members o f the Livanos fam ily are our principal shareholders and can effectively control the outcome o f most matters on which our shareholders are entitled to vote; their interests may be differentfront yours.
Entities controlled by members of the Livanos family, including our Chairman, may be deemed to beneficially own approximately 40% of our issued and outstanding common shares. As a result of shareholding, Mr. Livanos can effectively control the outcome of most matters on which our shareholders are entitled to vote, including the election of our entire board of directors and other significant corporate actions. The interests of these shareholders may be different from yours.
Provisions in our organizational documents may have anti-takeover effects.
Our bye-laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions require an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes attaching to all issued and outstanding shares to approve any merger, consolidation, amalgamation or similar transactions. Our bye-laws also provide for restrictions on the time period in which directors may be nominated.
These provisions could make it difficult for our shareholders to replace or remove our current board of directors or could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing an offer by a third party to acquire us, even if the third party's offer may be considered beneficial by many shareholders. As a result, shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.
Tax Risks
In addition to the following risk factors, you should read "Item 10. Additional Information--E. Tax Considerations" for a more complete discussion of the material Bermuda and U.S. Federal income tax considerations relating to us and the ownership and disposition of our common shares and Preference Shares.
We will have to pay tax on U.S.-source income, which would reduce our earnings.
Under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the "Code", the U.S. source gross transportation income of a ship owning or chartering corporation, such as ourselves, is subject to a 4% U.S. Federal income tax without allowance for deduction, unless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax under a tax treaty or Section 883 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. U.S. source gross transportation income consists of 50% of the gross shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States.
We do not currently qualify for a tax treaty exemption or a statutory tax exemption, and therefore we are subject to the 4% U.S. Federal income tax described above. We do not expect any
33

resulting U.S. tax liability to be material or materially reduce the earnings available for distribution to our shareholders for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. For 2016, the U.S. source gross transportation tax was $0.30 million. Changes to our business could change this expectation and in such circumstances we may attempt to qualify for the exemption from tax under Section 883. For a more detailed discussion, see the section entitled "Item 10. Additional Information--E. Tax Considerations--United States Federal Income Tax Considerations-- U.S. Taxation of Our Operating Income".
I f we were treated as a "passive foreign investment company", certain adverse U.S. Federal income tax consequences could result to U.S. shareholders.
A foreign corporation will be treated as a "passive foreign investment company", or "PFIC", for U.S. Federal income tax purposes if at least 75% of its gross income for any tax year consists of certain types of "passive income", or at least 50% of the average value of the corporation's assets produce or are held for the production of those types of "passive income". For purposes of these tests, "passive income" includes dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties that are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. For purposes of these tests, income derived from the performance of services does not constitute "passive income". U.S. shareholders of a PFIC are subject to a disadvantageous U.S. Federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the distributions they receive from the PFIC and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their shares in the PFIC. If we are treated as a PFIC for any tax year, we will provide information to U.S. shareholders who request such information to enable them to make certain elections to alleviate certain of the adverse U.S. Federal income tax consequences that would arise as a result of holding an interest in a PFIC.
Based on our method of operation, we do not believe that we are a PFIC for this tax year. In this regard, we intend to treat the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from our time chartering activities as services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, we believe that our income from our time chartering activities does not constitute "passive income", and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income do not constitute passive assets.
There is, however, no legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing our proposed method of operation. Accordingly, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the "IRS", or a court of law may not accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, we could constitute a PFIC for a future tax year if there were to be changes in the nature and extent of our operations.
If the IRS were to find that we are or have been a PFIC for any tax year, U.S. shareholders would face adverse tax consequences. Under the PFIC rules, unless those shareholders make certain elections available under the Code, such shareholders would be liable to pay U.S. Federal income tax at the then prevailing income tax rates on ordinary income plus interest upon excess distributions and upon any gain from the disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares, as if the excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder's holding period. Please read "Item 10. Additional Information--E. Tax Considerations--United States Federal Income Tax Considerations--Taxation of United States Holders--PFIC Status and Significant Tax Consequences" for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. Federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders if we are treated as a PFIC.
ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY
A. History and Development of the Company
GasLog was incorporated in Bermuda on July 16, 2003. GasLog and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the ownership, operation and management of vessels in the LNG market, providing maritime services for the transportation of LNG on a worldwide basis and LNG vessel
34

management services. The Group conducts its operations through its vessel-owning subsidiaries and through its vessel management services subsidiary.
Our company and its founders have a long history in shipping and in LNG carriers. Our largest shareholder is Ceres Shipping, whose founding family's shipping activities commenced more than 100 years ago and who is currently controlled by our Chairman, Peter G. Livanos. The late Mr. George P. Livanos, father of our current Chairman, established the predecessor to Ceres Shipping. Ceres Shipping also has interests in tankers, dry bulk carriers and containerships. Ceres Shipping entered the LNG sector in 2001 by undertaking the management of BG Group's owned fleet of LNG carriers through our subsidiary GasLog LNG Services, and in 2003 GasLog Ltd. was incorporated. Until 2010, when we took delivery of the C a sL o g S a va n n a h and the G a sL o g S in g a p o re, our business principally consisted of providing technical ship management services, as well as plan approval and construction supervision services for newbuilding LNG carriers. As a result, we have had a longer presence in LNG shipping than many other independent owners currently operating in the sector. For a description of our historical and current capital expenditures, see "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects--B. Liquidity and Capital Resources--Capital Expenditures".
On April 4, 2012, we completed our initial public offering, or "IPO", and our common shares began trading on the NYSE on March 30, 2012 under the ticker symbol "GLOG". On January 22, 2014, GasLog completed a follow-on public offering of 10,925,000 common shares (including 1,425,000 common shares in relation to the over-allotment option exercised in full by the underwriters) and a concurrent private placement of 2,317,460 common shares at the public offering price to certain of its directors and officers and one of its major shareholders. The offering and private placement resulted in net proceeds of $199.02 million, which were used to partially finance the acquisition of the first three ships acquired from MSL in 2014. On April 16, 2014, GasLog completed a second follow-on public offering of 4,887,500 common shares (including 637,500 common shares in relation to the over-allotment option exercised in full by the underwriters). The offering resulted in net proceeds of $109.94 million, which were used to partially finance the acquisition of the additional three ships acquired from MSL in 2014.
On May 12, 2014, our subsidiary GasLog Partners completed an IPO of 9,660,000 common units (including 1,260,000 units in relation to the over-allotment option exercised in full by the underwriters), resulting in net proceeds of $186.03 million. GasLog Partners is a Marshall Islands master limited partnership formed by us to own and operate LNG carriers under long-term charters. Its common units representing limited partner interests are traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "GLOP". Concurrently with the initial public offering, GasLog Partners acquired a 100.0% ownership interest in GAS-three Ltd., GAS-four Ltd. and GAS-five Ltd., the entities that owned the G a sL o g S h a n g h a i, the G asL o g S a n tia g o and the G a sL o g Sydney, from GasLog, in exchange for (i) 162,358 common units and 9,822,358 subordinated units issued to GasLog representing a 49.8% ownership interest and all of the incentive distribution rights that entitle GasLog to increasing percentages of the cash that the Partnership distributes in excess of $0.43125 per unit per quarter, (ii) 400,913 general partner units issued to GasLog Partners GP LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of GasLog, representing a 2.0% general partner interest and (iii) $65.70 million of cash consideration paid directly to us from the offering proceeds. In addition to the cash consideration of $65.70 million paid to us, GasLog Partners used the $186.03 million net proceeds of its IPO to (a) prepay $82.63 million of debt plus accrued interest of $0.42 million and (b) make a payment of $2.28 million (including $0.27 million accrued interest) to settle the mark-to-market loss on termination of one interest rate swap and reduction of a second interest rate swap in connection with the aforementioned debt prepayment. The balance of $35.0 million was retained by GasLog Partners for general corporate purposes.
On September 29, 2014, GasLog Partners completed a follow-on public offering of 4,500,000 common units at an offering price of $31.00 per unit. The total net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses were $133.0 million. GasLog Partners used the proceeds to partially finance the acquisition from GasLog of the 100.0% ownership interests in GAS-sixteen Ltd. and GAS-seventeen Ltd., the entities that owned the M e th a n e R ita
35

A n d re a and the M e th a n e J a n e E liza b e th , respectively, and to prepay $25.0 million of debt secured by those carriers in October 2014.
On April 7, 2015, GasLog completed a public offering of 4,600,000 Preference Shares, par value $0.01 per share, liquidation preference $25.00 per share and priced at $25.00 per share, including 600,000 shares issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional Preference Shares. The net proceeds from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses were $110.65 million to be used for general corporate purposes. The Preference Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "GLOG PR A".
On June 26, 2015, GasLog Partners completed a follow-on public offering of 7,500,000 common units at an offering price of $23.90 per unit. The total net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses were $171.83 million. The Partnership used the proceeds from the public offering to partially finance the acquisition from GasLog of 100.0% of the ownership interests in GAS-nineteen Ltd., GAS-twenty Ltd. and GAS-twenty one Ltd., the entities that own the M e th a n e A liso n V ictoria, the M e th a n e S h irley E lisa b e th and the M e th a n e H e a th e r Sa lly, respectively. The acquisition closed on July 1, 2015.
On August 5, 2016, GasLog Partners completed a follow-on public offering of 2,750,000 common units at an offering price of $19.50 per unit. The total net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses were $52.30 million. The Partnership used the proceeds from the public offering to partially finance the acquisition from GasLog of 100.0% of the ownership interests in GAS-seven Ltd., the entity that owns the G a sL o g Seattle. The acquisition closed on November 1, 2016.
On January 27, 2017, GasLog Partners completed a follow-on public offering of 3,750,000 common units at an offering price of $20.50 per unit. The total net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses were $75.49 million. On February 24, 2017, GasLog Partners issued additional 120,000 common units in relation to the exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option resulting in additional net proceeds of $2.44 million. The Partnership plans to use the net proceeds from the public offering for general partnership purposes, which may include future acquisitions, debt repayment, capital expenditures and additions to working capital.
As of February 27, 2017, GasLog holds a 27.57% interest in the Partnership and, as a result of its ownership of the general partner and the fact that the general partner elects the majority of the Partnership's directors in accordance with the Partnership's partnership agreement, or the "Partnership Agreement", GasLog, has the ability to control the Partnership's affairs and policies. Consequently, GasLog Partners is consolidated in the Group's financial statements. The Group's control of the general partner and consequently of the Partnership could be challenged with a 66.67% vote by other unitholders. However, as the Partnership Agreement limits any single unitholder to a maximum of 4.9% of the vote, it is highly unlikely that a coordinated vote of widely held unitholders will be organized to change the Group's control of the general partner. As a result, the Group continues to assume that control of the general partner is a relevant basis on which to conclude control of the Partnership.
As described elsewhere herein, GasLog Partners holds options to acquire from GasLog an additional seven vessels and GAS-twenty six Ltd. with its long-term bareboat charter of (and right to acquire) the M e th a n e J u lia L o u ise (which is subject to a multi-year charter to MSL). In general, we would expect the exercise of these options to be beneficial to GasLog, as it can be expected to reduce our consolidated indebtedness and, if GasLog Partners increases its per unit distributions, increase the return on our incentive distribution rights (although our common unit interest will be diluted by any GasLog Partners equity issuance). GasLog Partners will determine whether, and when, to exercise any of the options and rights that it holds. The timing of those decisions will depend in part on the price and availability of debt and equity financing to GasLog Partners. See "Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions--B. Related Party Transactions--Relationship with GasLog Partners--Omnibus Agreement".

On October 1, 2015, GasLog, Dynagas and Golar established the Cool Pool to market their vessels, which are currently operating in the LNG shipping spot market. The Cool Pool allows the participating owners to optimize the operation of the pool vessels through improved scheduling ability, cost efficiencies and common marketing. The objective of the Cool Pool is to serve the transportation requirements of a rapidly growing LNG shipping market by providing customers with reliable, yet flexible, and innovative solutions to meet their increasingly complex shipping requirements.
As of February 27, 2017, the Cool Pool consists of 18 modern high quality and essentially equivalent vessels powered by tri-fuel diesel electric ("TFDE") propulsion technology. The three owners' vessels eligible for participation in the Cool Pool are as follows: GasLog: five vessels; Dynagas: three vessels; and Golar: ten vessels. Each vessel owner continues to be fully responsible for the manning and technical management of its respective vessels. The Cool Pool focuses on charters of 12 months' duration or less. The scheduling of employment opportunities in excess of 12 months will remain the mandate of the respective vessel owner. If a Cool Pool vessel is scheduled by an owner for a charter that exceeds 12 months in duration, such vessel will cease to be part of the Cool Pool.
We maintain our principal executive offices at Gildo Pastor Center, 7 Rue du Gabian, MC 98000, Monaco. Our telephone number at that address is +377 97 97 51 15. We are registered with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda under registration number 33928. We maintain a registered office in Bermuda at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton, HM 11, Bermuda.
B. Business Overview
Overview
We are an international owner, operator and manager of LNG carriers providing support to international energy companies as part of their LNG logistics chain. Our owned fleet consists of 27 owned LNG carriers, including 22 ships on the water and five LNG carriers on order at two of the world's leading LNG shipbuilders, Samsung and Hyundai. This includes nine LNG carriers in operation that are owned by our NYSE-listed subsidiary GasLog Partners, with which we have entered into certain agreements governing our relationship, including purchase options for certain of our ships. We currently manage and operate 24 LNG carriers including 12 of our wholly owned ships in operation (one is managed by a subsidiary of Shell), the nine ships contributed or sold to the Partnership, one ship owned by Shell, one additional LNG carrier in which we have a 25.0% interest and a vessel secured under a long-term bareboat charter from Lepta Shipping, a subsidiary of Mitsui. We are also supervising the construction of our newbuildings. We have secured multi-year time and seasonal time charter contracts for eight of our owned ships, the nine ships owned by the Partnership, our five newbuildings on order and the one vessel secured under a long-term bareboat charter with Lepta Shipping. As of December 31, 2016, these contracts are expected to provide total contracted revenues of $3.57 billion during their initial terms, which expire between 2018 and 2029.
We also have a 25.0% interest in an additional ship, the Methane Nile Eagle, a 2007-built LNG carrier technically managed by us that is currently operating under a 20-year time charter to MSL.
Our current time charters have initial terms of up to ten years and include options that permit the charterers to extend the terms for successive periods under hire rate provisions. We will continue to evaluate the attractiveness of longer and shorter-term chartering opportunities as the commercial characteristics of the LNG carrier industry evolve. We have structured our order book of new LNG carriers to have staggered delivery dates, facilitating a smooth integration of the ships into our fleet as well as significant annual growth through 2019. This has the additional advantage of spreading our exposure to the re-employment of these ships over several years upon expiration of their current charters.
Each of our 27 owned LNG carriers is designed with a capacity of between approximately 145,000 cbm and 180,000 cbm. We believe this size range maximizes their operational flexibility, as these ships are compatible with most existing LNG terminals around the world. All but three of the LNG carriers in our owned fleet are of the same specifications (in groups of ten, eight and six
37

ships), which allows us to benefit from economies of scale and operating efficiencies in ship construction, crew training, crew rotation and shared spare parts. Upon delivery of the last of our five contracted newbuildings, our owned fleet will have an average age of 6.3 years, making it one of the youngest in the industry. By comparison, as of December 31, 2016, the average age for the global fleet of LNG carriers, including LNG carriers of all sizes, was 11.9 years.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, GasLog LNG Services, exclusively handles the technical management of our fleet, including plan approval for new ship orders, supervision of ship construction and planning and supervision of dry-dockings, as well as technical operations, crewing, training, maintenance, regulatory and classification compliance and health, safety, security and environmental, or "HSSE", management and reporting. As the sole technical manager of BG Group's owned fleet of LNG carriers for over 15 years, we have established a track record for the efficient, safe and reliable operation of LNG carriers, which is evidenced by our safety performance and the limited off-hire days of the 24 ships currently operating under our management.
In 2015 we began to develop a floating LNG storage and regasification unit ("FSRU") strategy and signed two front-end engineering design ("FEED") studies with Keppel Offshore and Marine Ltd. for the potential conversion of both a Steam and TFDE vessel from our existing fleet. On December 5, 2016 we announced that Keppel Shipyard Limited had begun ordering the long lead items required for the conversion of a GasLog or Gaslog Partners LNG carrier to a FSRU. In addition, on December 22, 2016 we announced that a wholly owned subsidiary of GasLog has entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire a 20% shareholding in Gastrade S.A ("Gastrade"). Gastrade is licensed to develop an independent natural gas system offshore Alexandroupolis in Northern Greece utilizing a FSRU along with other fixed infrastructure. The acquisition of the 20% shareholding in Gastrade closed on February 9, 2017.

111 Indicates the expiration o f the initial term.
121 The period shown reflects the expiration of the minimum optional period and the maximum optional period. The charterer o f the GasLog Shagen has unilateral options to extend the term o f the charter for up to ten years, on a seasonal charter basis. The charterer o f the GasLog Seattle and the Solaris has unilateral options to extend the term o f the time charter for periods ranging from five to ten years, provided that the charterer provides us with advance notice of declaration o f any option in accordance with the terms o f the applicable charter. The charterer of the Methane Lydon Volney has a unilateral option to extend the term for a period o f either three or five years at its election. In addition, the charterer o f the Methane Shirley Elisabeth, the Methane Heather Sally and the Methane Alison Victoria has a unilateral option to extend the term o f two o f the related time charters for a period o f either three or five years at its election. The charterers o f the GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog Santiago and the GasLog Sydney have the option to extend the charters for two consecutive periods o f three or four years each plus or minus 30 days, and each charter extension and the length thereof is to be nominated by charterers at least 18 months before the end o f each current charter period and shall follow in direct continuation o f the then preceding period. No such nominations have been made in respect of the GasLog Shanghai and the GasLog Santiago. The charterer of the Methane Rita Andrea and the Methane Jane Elizabeth may extend either or both of these charters for one extension period o f three or five years, and each charter requires that the charterer provide us with advance notice o f its exercise o f any extension option. The charterer o f the Methane Becki Anne and the Methane Julia Louise has a unilateral option to extend the term o f the time charters for a period o f either three or five years at its election. The charterer o f the GasLog Greece and the GasLog Glasgow has the right to extend the charters for a period o f five years at the charterer's option. The charterer of the GasLog Geneva has the right to extend the charter by two additional periods o f five and three years, respectively, provided that the charterer provides us with advance notice o f declaration.
,3) Vessels operating in the spot market that participate in the Cool Pool. See "Item 4. Information o f the Company--A. History and Development o f the Company."
|4) Time charter provides for full employment for three years and a subsequent five year seasonal charter under which the ship is employed for seven months and available to accept other charters for five months.
(.si p ursuant to the agreement signed with MSL on April 21, 2015, with respect to the GasLog Sydney, whose charter was shortened by eight months under such agreement, if MSL does not exercise the charter extension options for the GasLog Sydney, and GasLog Partners does not enter into a third-party charter for the GasLog Sydney, GasLog and GasLog Partners intend to enter into a bareboat or time charter arrangement that is designed to guarantee the total cash distribution from the vessel for any period o f charter shortening.
|6) On February 24, 2016, GasLog's subsidiary, GAS-twenty six Ltd., completed the sale and leaseback o f the Methane Julia Louise with Lepta Shipping. Lepta Shipping has the right to on-sell and lease back the vessel. The vessel was sold to Lepta Shipping for a total consideration approximately equivalent to its current book value. GasLog has leased back the vessel under a bareboat charter from Lepta Shipping for a period o f up to 20 years. GasLog has the option to re-purchase the vessel on pre-agreed terms no earlier than the end o f year ten and no later than the end o f year 17 o f the bareboat charter. The vessel remains on its eleven-year- charter with MSL, a subsidiary o f Shell.

Under the omnibus agreement entered into with GasLog Partners and certain of its subsidiaries in connection with the Partnership's initial public offering, GasLog Partners has the option to purchase from us: (i) the Solaris, the G a sL o g G reece, the G a sL o g G lasgow , the G a sL o g G eneva and the G a sL o g G ib ra lta r within 36 months after we notify the Partnership's board of directors of the vessel's acceptance by her charterer, (ii) the M e th a n e L y d o n V olney within 36 months after the closing of GasLog Partners' IPO on May 12, 2014 which option will expire in May 2017 if not extended, and (iii) the M e th a n e B e c k i A n n e and the right to acquire GAS-twenty six Ltd. with its long-term bareboat charter of (and the right to acquire) the M e th a n e J u lia L o u ise (which is subject to a multi-year charter to MSL) within 36 months after the completion of its acquisition by GasLog on March 31, 2015. In each case, GasLog Partners' option to purchase is at fair market value as determined pursuant to the omnibus agreement.
The key characteristics of our current owned fleet include the following:
· each ship is sized at between approximately 145,000 cbm and 180,000 cbm capacity, which places our ships in the medium- to large-size class of LNG carriers; we believe this size range maximizes their operational flexibility, as these ships are compatible with most existing LNG terminals around the world, and minimizes excess LNG boil-off;
· each ship is double-hulled, which is standard in the LNG industry;
· each ship has a membrane containment system incorporating current industry construction standards, including guidelines and recommendations from Gaztransport and Technigaz (the designer of the membrane system) as well as updated standards from our classification society;
· each of our ships is modern steam powered or has TFDE or dual-fuel two-stroke engine propulsion technology;
· Bermuda is the flag state of each ship;
· each of our delivered ships has received, and each of our newbuildings is expected to receive, an ENVIRO+ notation from our classification society, which denotes compliance with its published guidelines concerning the most stringent criteria for environmental protection related to design characteristics, management and support systems, sea discharges and air emissions; and
· upon delivery of the last of our five contracted newbuildings in 2019, our owned fleet will have an average age of 6.3 years, making it one of the youngest in the industry, compared to a current average age of 11.9 years for the global LNG carrier fleet including LNG carriers of all sizes as of December 31, 2016.
In addition to our owned fleet, we have a 25.0% ownership interest in Egypt LNG, an entity whose principal asset is the M e th a n e N ile E agle. The M e th a n e N ile E a g le is a 145,000 cbm LNG carrier that was built in 2007. It is currently chartered to MSL under a 20-year time charter, which
40

is subject to extension for up to 10 years at the charterer's option. On October 29, 2015, Egypt LNG and BG Group mutually agreed to lay up the M e th a n e N ile E a g le for a period of approximately one year. The charterer continued to pay charter hire costs adjusted for net savings in operating expenses and insurance as a result of the vessel being laid up. The M e th a n e N ile E a g le was re-activated on October 15, 2016.
We continually evaluate short and long-term charter opportunities for our vessels, including the newbuildings for which we do not currently have charters fixed. Our discussions with potential charterers are at various stages of advancement; however, we cannot provide assurance that we will conclude any particular charter or, if concluded, the charter rate that will apply.

Managed Fleet

Through GasLog LNG Services, we provide technical ship management services for three LNG carriers owned by third parties (including the bareboat vessel) in addition to management of the 21 LNG carriers currently operating in our owned fleet (the S o la ris is managed by a subsidiary of Shell). We supervised the construction by Samsung of each LNG carrier in our managed fleet, and each ship has operated under our technical management since its delivery from the shipyard with the exception of the Solaris.

111 The Methane Nile Eagle is owned by Egypt LNG in which we indirectly hold a 25.0% equity interest. BG Asia Pacific Pte. Limited, a subsidiary o f Shell, and Eagle Gas Shipping Co. E.S.A., an entity affiliated with the government of Egypt, have 25.0% and 50.0% equity interests, respectively, in Egypt LNG.

Ship Time Charters
We provide the services of our ships under time charters. A time charter is a contract for the use of the ship for a specified term at a daily hire rate. Under a time charter, the ship owner provides crewing and other services related to the ship's operation, the cost of which is covered by the hire rate, and the customer is responsible for substantially all of the ship voyage costs (including bunker fuel, port charges and canal fees and LNG boiloff).
We entered into four master time charters with MSL that established the general terms under which the G a sL o g S h a n g h a i, the G a sL o g S a n tia g o , the G a sL o g S y d n ey , the G a sL o g Shagen, the G a sL o g G reece, the G a slo g G lasgow , the G a sL o g G en eva and the G a sL o g G ib ra lta r and the three newbuildings identified by Hull numbers 2130, 2131 and 2800 will be chartered to MSL. We enter into separate confirmation memorandums for each ship in order to supplement the master time charter and specify the charter term, extension options (if any), hire rate and other provisions applicable to each ship's charter. For the six vessels acquired from MSL in 2014, the two vessels acquired in 2015 and the G a sL o g S a va n n a h we entered into separate time charters for each vessel.
We have entered into maiden voyage time charter agreements and time charter agreements with a subsidiary of Shell, establishing the terms under which the G a sL o g S e a ttle and the S o la ris will be chartered to Shell.
The G a sL o g C helsea, the G a sL o g S a ra to g a , the G a sL o g S alem , the G a sL o g S in g a p o re and the G a sL o g S a va n n a h are operating in the Cool Pool and from time to time enter into short-term time charters.
We have entered into time charter agreements with Total establishing the terms under which Hull No. 2801 will be chartered to Total; and with Centrica establishing the terms under which Hull No. 2212 will be chartered to Centrica.

The following discussion describes the material terms of the time charters for our owned ships.
Initial Term, Extensions and Redeiivety
The initial terms of the time charters for the the C a sL o g S h a n g h a i, the C a sL o g S a n tia g o , the C a sL o g S y d n e y and the C a sL o g Sha g en began upon delivery of the ships and will terminate in 2018, 2018, 2018 and 2021, respectively. The charter for the C a sL o g Shagen provides for full employment for three years and a subsequent five year seasonal charter under which the ship is employed for seven months and available to accept other charters for five months. The charterer has options to extend the terms of the charters as follows: for the C a sL o g S h a n g h a i, the C a sL o g S a n tia g o and the C a sL o g S ydney, for up to eight years; for the C a sL o g Shagen for up to 10 years (on the seasonal charter basis); in each case at specified hire rates. The options to extend have not been exercised by the charterer with respect to the C a sL o g S h a n g h a i and the C a sL o g S a n tiago.
The initial term of the time charters for the M e th a n e L y d o n V olney. the M e th a n e R ita A n d re a , the M e th a n e J a n e E liza b e th , the M e th a n e S h irley E lisa b e th , the M e th a n e A liso n V ictoria and the M e th a n e H e a th e r S a lly began upon delivery to GasLog following their acquisition from MSL in 2014, and will terminate on various dates in 2019 and 2020. For the M e th a n e L y d o n V olney, the M e th a n e R ita A n d re a and the M e th a n e J a n e E liza b eth , MSL has the option to extend the term of two of the time charters for a period of either three or five years beyond the initial charter expiration date. For the other vessels, MSL has the option to extend the term of the time charters for two of the ships for an additional period of either three or five years beyond the initial charter expiration date.
The initial term of the time charter for the C a sL o g G reece, the C a sL o g G lasgow , the C a sL o g G eneva and the C a sL o g G ib ra lta r b e g a n upon delivery of the ships and will terminate in 2026, 2026, 2023 and 2023 respectively. For the C a sL o g G reece and the C a sL o g G lasgow MSL has option to extend the terms of the charters for up to five years and for the C a sL o g G eneva and the C a sL o g G ib ra lta r MSL has the option to extend the terms of the charters for up to 8 years.
Our time charters to MSL for Hull No. 2130 and Hull No. 2800 will begin three and 14 months, respectively, after the delivery of the vessels in 2018 and for Hull No. 2131 will begin five months after the delivery of the vessel in 2019. The initial charter terms for the ships will terminate for one ship in 2027, one ship in 2028 and one ship in 2029. MSL has options to extend terms of the charters for Hulls No. 2130, 2131 and 2800 for two consecutive periods of three years each, all at specified hire rates.
The initial term of the time charter for the C a sL o g S e a ttle and the S o la ris began upon delivery of the ships following an initial period during which the ships operated under maiden voyage time charters, the purpose of which was to facilitate completion by Shell of an operational discharge inspection of the ships. The time charters for the C a sL o g S e a ttle and the S o la ris will terminate in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In each case, Shell has options to extend the charter terms for periods ranging from five to ten years at specified hire rates.
The initial term of the time charters for the M e th a n e B ec h i A n n e and the M e th a n e J u lia L o u ise began upon delivery to GasLog and will terminate in 2024 and 2026. MSL will have options to extend the term of the time charter for the M e th a n e B ech i A n n e and the long-term bareboat charter of the M e th a n e Ju lia L o u ise which is now owned by Lepta Shipping and leased back to GasLog, for an additional period of either three or five years beyond the initial charter expiration date.
Our time charter to Total for Hull No. 2801 will begin upon delivery of the vessel in 2018. The initial charter term will terminate in 2025. Total has the option to extend the term of the charter by a three-year period at the charterer's option at a specified hire rate.
Our time charter to Centrica for Hull No. 2212 will begin upon delivery of the vessel in 2019. The initial charter term will terminate in 2026. Centrica has the option to extend the term of the charter by three consecutive periods of two years each at the charterer's option.
The terms and period for fixtures o f the G a sL o g S in g a p o re , the G a sL o g S a v a n n a h , the G a sL o g C helsea, the G a sL o g S a ra to g a and the G a sL o g S alem vary from charter to charter, as is the nature of trading in the spot market.
42

Our time charters provide for redelivery of the ship to us at the expiration of the term, as such term may be extended upon the charterer's exercise of its extension options, or upon earlier termination of the charter (as described below) plus or minus 30 days. Under all of our charters, the charterer has the right to extend the term for most periods in which the ship is off-hire. Our charter contracts do not provide the charterers with options to purchase our ships during or upon expiration of the charter term.
Hire Rate Provisions
"Hire rate" refers to the basic payment from the customer for use of the ship. Under all of our time charters, the hire rate is payable to us monthly in advance in U.S. dollars. Depending on the time charter contract, there are three methods by which the daily hire rate for our owned ships is determined:
· Under the first method, the hire rate includes two components--a capital cost component and an operating cost component. The capital cost component relates to the cost of the ship's purchase and is a fixed daily amount that is structured to provide a return on our invested capital. Some of the charters provide for the capital cost component to increase by a specified amount during any option period. The operating cost component is a fixed daily amount that increases annually at a fixed percentage. Although the daily amount of the operating cost component is fixed (subject to a specified annual increase), it is intended to correspond to the costs of operating the ship and related expenses. In the event of a material increase or decrease in the actual costs we incur in operating the ship, a clause in the charter provides each party the right in certain circumstances to seek a review and potential adjustment of the operating cost component. Under one of our time charters, the hire rate for an initial period of three years is as discussed above and the subsequent five years are a seasonal charter under which the ship is committed for seven consecutive months at a fixed monthly charter hire (one component) and available to accept other charters for the remaining five months.
· Under the second method, the hire rate includes only one component that is a fixed daily amount that will either remain the same, increase or decrease by a specified amount during any option period as compared to the firm period.
· Under the third method, the hire rate for an initial period of up to two years, at the charterer's option, will be set at the prevailing market rate for a comparable ship, subject to a cap and a floor. Following such initial period, the hire rate will be calculated based on three components--a capital cost component, an operating cost component and a ship management fee. The capital cost component is a fixed daily amount, which will increase by a specified amount during any option period. The daily amount of the operating cost component, which is intended to fully pass-through to the charterer the costs of operating the ship, is set annually and adjusted at the end of each year to compensate us for the actual costs we incur in operating the ship. Dry-docking expenses are budgeted in advance and are reimbursed by the charterers immediately following a dry-docking. The ship management fee is a daily amount set in line with industry practice for fees charged by ship managers and is intended to compensate us for management of the ship.
The hire rates for each of our ships may be reduced if the ship does not perform to certain of its specifications or if we breach our obligations under the charter. We have had no instances of hire rate reductions since the first two of our owned ships commenced operations in 2010.
Off-Hire
When a ship is "off-hire"--or not available for service--a time charterer generally is not required to pay the hire rate, and we remain responsible for all costs, including the cost of any LNG cargo lost as boil-off during such off-hire periods. Our time charters provide an annual allowance period for us to schedule preventative maintenance work on the ship. A ship generally will be deemed off-hire under our time charters if there is a specified time outside of the annual allowance period when the ship is not available for the charterer's use due to, among other things, operational
43

deficiencies (including the failure to maintain a certain guaranteed speed), dry-docking for repairs, maintenance or inspection, equipment breakdowns, deficiency of personnel or neglect of duty by the ship's officers or crew, deviation from course, or delays due to accidents, quarantines, ship detentions or similar problems. We have obtained loss of hire insurance to protect us against loss of income as a result of a ship being off-hire. See "--Risk of Loss, Insurance and Risk Management--Loss of Hire Insurance".
All ships are dry-docked at least once every five years as required by the ship's classification society for a special survey. Our ships are considered to be off-hire under our time charters during such periods.
Termination and Cancellation
Under our existing time charters, each party has certain termination rights which include, among other things, the automatic termination of a charter upon loss of the relevant ship. Either party may elect to terminate a charter upon the occurrence of specified defaults or upon the outbreak of war or hostilities involving two or more major nations, such as the United States or the People's Republic of China, if such war or hostilities materially and adversely affect the trading of the ship for a period of at least 30 days. In addition, our charterers have the option to terminate a charter if the relevant ship is off-hire for any reason other than scheduled dry-docking for a period exceeding 90 consecutive days, or for more than 90 days or 110 days, depending on the charter, in any one-year period. Certain of our charters give the charterer a termination option for shorter periods of off-hire, if such off-hire is due to an uncured breach of our obligations to maintain the applicable ship.
In addition to its termination rights, Shell has the right to convert the time charter with respect to the relevant ship into a bareboat charter upon the occurrence of specified defaults or in the event that Shell's quality assurance review is not successfully completed upon delivery of the ship.
All of the time charters applicable to our newbuildings permit the charterer to cancel the charter in the event of a prolonged delay in the delivery of the ship from the shipyard, and in certain circumstances obligate us to pay liquidated damages to the charterer in the event of a less significant delivery delay. However, the cancellation and liquidated damages provisions in our charters are structured to mirror the provisions of our contracts with the shipyard, giving us the right to receive liquidated damages from the shipyard or cancel the shipbuilding contract in the same circumstances that would trigger the charterer's right to cancel the charter contract or receive liquidated damages because of delivery delays.
The Cool Pool
Five of our vessels are operating as part of the Cool Pool established in October 2015, with Dynagas and Golar. The Cool Pool was established to market certain of each company's vessels which are currently operating in the LNG shipping spot market. The Cool Pool allows the participating owners to optimize the operation of the pool vessels through improved scheduling ability, cost efficiencies and common marketing. The objective of the Cool Pool is to serve the transportation requirements of a rapidly growing LNG shipping market by providing customers with reliable, yet flexible, and innovative solutions to meet their increasingly complex shipping requirements.
As of February 27, 2017, the Cool Pool consists of 18 modern high quality and essentially equivalent vessels powered by fuel efficient TFDE propulsion technology. The three owners' vessels eligible for participation in the Cool Pool are as follows: GasLog: five vessels; Dynagas: three vessels; and Golar: ten vessels. Each vessel owner continues to be fully responsible for the manning and technical management of its respective vessels.
The Cool Pool focuses on charters of 12 months' duration or less. The scheduling of employment opportunities in excess of 12 months will remain the mandate of the respective vessel owner. If a Cool Pool vessel is scheduled by an owner for a charter that exceeds 12 months in duration, such vessel will cease to be part of the Cool Pool.
44

Gross pool revenues represent time charter revenues earned by GasLog vessels participating in the pool under charter agreements where GasLog contracts directly with charterers. Revenue is recognised on a monthly basis, when the vessel is made available and services are provided to the charterer during the period, the amount can be estimated reliably and collection of the related revenue is reasonably assured.
Voyage expenses and commissions include the net allocation from the pool which represents GasLog's share of the net revenues earned from the other pool participants' vessels less the other participants' share of the net revenues earned by GasLog's vessels included in the pool. Each participant's share of the net pool revenues is based on the number of pool points attributable to its vessels and the number of days such vessels participated in the pool.

The Bareboat Charter
On February 24, 2016, GasLog's subsidiary, GAS-twenty six Ltd., completed the sale and leaseback of the Methane Julia Louise with Lepta Shipping. Lepta Shipping has the right to on-sell and lease back the vessel. The vessel was sold to Lepta Shipping for a total consideration approximately equivalent to its current book value. GasLog has leased back the vessel under a bareboat charter from Lepta Shipping for a period of up to 20 years. GasLog has the option to re-purchase the vessel on pre-agreed terms no earlier than the end of year ten and no later than the end of year 17 of the bareboat charter. The vessel remains on its 11 year charter with MSL.

Shipbuilding Contracts
We have entered into shipbuilding contracts with Samsung and Hyundai in respect of three and two newbuildings, respectively, which have an aggregate contract price of approximately $1.04 billion. As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding balance in the aggregate was $0.95 billion, which will be paid in installments upon steel cutting, keel laying and launching of the ship, with the largest portion of the purchase price for each ship coming due upon its delivery. All of our obligations under the shipbuilding contracts are payable in U.S. dollars.
As of December 31, 2016, our remaining payment obligations under the shipbuilding contracts were as follows:

Amounts due in less than one year Amounts due in one to three years Total

As of December 31, 2016111

$

63,656

883,276

$

946,932

111 Amounts do not reflect installments o f $10.36 million paid in 2017.
The shipbuilding contracts provide for the five newbuildings to be delivered and ready for immediate operation on various dates in 2018 through 2019. The shipbuilding contracts require Samsung and Hyundai to pay us liquidated damages in the event of certain delays in the delivery of a ship unless such delays are attributable to a force majeure event, and in the event of a prolonged delay we would have the right to cancel the contract and receive a refund of any installment payments previously made on the ship.
In the event that we fail to meet our payment obligations under a shipbuilding contract, we would be in default under the applicable contract and would be obligated to pay interest under the contract. If such a default by us were to continue for more than five business days, the delivery date of the applicable ship would be delayed by one day for each day that we remain in default, and if a default by us were to continue for more than 15 business days, Samsung and Hyundai would have the option of cancelling the applicable shipbuilding contract and retaining any installment payments previously funded by us under the contract.

Ship Management Services and Construction Supervision
Management of our owned fleet, which includes plan approval for new ship orders, supervision of ship construction and planning and supervision of dry-dockings, as well as technical operations, crewing, training, maintenance, regulatory and classification compliance and HSSE management and reporting, is provided in-house by our wholly owned subsidiary, GasLog LNG Services, an entity incorporated in Bermuda with an office in Piraeus, Greece. In addition to management of our owned fleet, through GasLog LNG Services we provide technical ship management services for a fleet of three ships, which consists of one ship we manage on behalf of MSL, the M e th a n e N ile E a g le , a ship in which we have a 25.0% ownership interest and the M e th a n e J u lia L o u ise, which we lease from Lepta Shipping. During the year ended December 31, 2016, ship management services provided to external customers accounted for approximately 0.40% of our consolidated revenues.
Construction Supervision
We supervise and manage the construction of our newbuildings through GasLog LNG Services. We have employees on-site in South Korea whose responsibilities include inspecting the ships under construction for non-conformities, attending trials of the ship and its machinery and equipment, consulting with the shipyard in the event of any modifications to the ship's specifications, reviewing the shipyard's choice of suppliers and sub-contractors and keeping our management informed of the progress of the construction. Through GasLog LNG Services, we also supervised the construction of the three LNG carriers in Shell's owned fleet and the M e th a n e N ile E a g le , all of which were constructed at Samsung.
Technical and Operational Management
Pursuant to ship management agreements, through GasLog LNG Services we manage the day-to-day aspects of ship operations, including crewing, training, employing armed guards for transport in certain high-risk areas, insurance, maintenance and repair, procurement of supplies and equipment, regulatory and classification compliance and HSSE management and reporting, as well as dry-docking under certain charters, for our owned fleet (with the exception of the S o la ris) and for the three ships in our managed fleet not owned by us. We utilize certain third-party sub contractors and suppliers in carrying out our technical management responsibilities. In the case of ships owned by Shell, Egypt LNG and Lepta Shipping, the crewing and other operational costs are fully passed-through to the ship owner, and for our technical management services the customers pay us a management fee per ship per month.
In connection with our ship management services, we also enter into consultant service agreements pursuant to which we provide specialized services relating to the management of LNG carriers. These services include the development and installation of a ship's ship management system, which includes installing onboard hardware and software systems and providing related training to the ship's personnel.
The terms of our ship management agreements and related contracts permit the customer to terminate our services for any reason upon a short period of advance notice, and both parties have termination rights upon the occurrence of specified defaults. In the event of the loss of a ship, or the owner's sale of a ship to a third party, the ship management agreement in respect of the ship would terminate automatically. Under our ship management agreements with Shell, in some circumstances Shell would be obligated to reimburse us for certain crew support and severance costs incurred as a result of a termination of the ship management agreement by Shell.
Competition
We operate in markets that are highly competitive and based primarily on supply and demand. Generally, competition for LNG time charters is based primarily on price, ship availability, size, age, technical specifications and condition, LNG shipping experience, quality and efficiency of ship operations, shipping industry relationships and reputation for customer service, and technical ability and reputation for operation of highly specialized ships. In addition, through the G a sL o g S in g a p o re,
46

the CasLog Chelsea, the CasLog Savannah, the CasLog Saratoga and the CasLog Salem we operate in the spot market that covers short-term charters of one year or less.
Although we believe that we are one of the few independent owners that focus on newly-built, technically advanced LNG carriers and provide in-house technical management of the fleet, other independent shipping companies also own and operate, and in some cases manage, LNG carriers and have new ships under construction. There are other ship owners and managers who may also attempt to participate in the LNG market in the future. We believe that our strategy of focusing on charter contracts with initial terms of five to ten years, as well as the scale of our technical ship management operations, differentiates us to some extent from other independent owners.
In addition to independent owners, some of the major oil and gas producers own LNG carriers and in the recent past they have contracted for the construction of new LNG carriers. National gas and shipping companies also have large fleets of LNG carriers that have expanded and may continue to expand. Some of these companies may compete with independent owners by using their fleets to carry LNG for third parties.
Seagoing and Shore-Based Employees
As of December 31, 2016 we had 173 full-time employees and contractors based in our offices in Greece, Monaco, London, New York, Singapore or the newbuildings site in South Korea. In addition to our shore-based employees and contractors, we had approximately 1,340 seafaring staff serving on our owned and managed ships. These seafarers are retained through crewing agencies based in Ukraine, the Philippines and Spain or, in the case of Greek seafarers, through direct hire. As we take delivery of our newbuildings, we expect to retain a significant number of additional seafarers qualified to man and operate our new ships, as well as additional shore-based personnel. We intend to focus our seafaring hiring efforts in the Ukrainian, Philippine and Spanish markets, where we have crewing agency agreements in place, and in Greece.
LNG marine transportation is a specialized area requiring technically skilled officers and personnel with specialized training. We regard attracting and retaining motivated, well-qualified seagoing and shore-based personnel as a top priority, and we offer our people competitive compensation packages and training and development opportunities. In addition, we provide intensive onboard training for our officers and crews to instill a culture of the highest operational and safety standards. As a result, we have historically enjoyed high retention rates. In 2016, our retention rate was 95% for senior seagoing officers, 98% for other seagoing officers and 99% for shore staff.
Although we have historically experienced high employee retention rates, the demand for technically skilled officers and crews to serve on LNG carriers has been increasing as the global fleet of LNG carriers continues to grow. This increased demand has and may continue to put inflationary cost pressure on ensuring qualified and well trained crew are available to GasLog. However, we expect that the impact of cost increases would be mitigated to some extent by certain provisions in our time charters, including automatic periodic adjustment provisions and cost review provisions.
Classification, Inspection and Maintenance
Every large, commercial seagoing ship must be "classed" by a classification society. The classification society certifies that the ship is "in class", signifying that the ship has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the ship's country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned. The classification society also undertakes on request other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned.
To ensure each ship is maintained in accordance with classification society standards and for maintenance of the class certificate, regular and extraordinary surveys of hull and machinery,
47

including the electrical plant, and any special equipment classes are required to be performed periodically. Surveys are based on a five-year cycle that consists of annual surveys, intermediate surveys that are typically completed between the second and third years of every five-year cycle, and comprehensive special surveys (also known as class renewal surveys) that are completed at each fifth anniversary of the ship's delivery.
All areas subject to surveys as defined by the classification society are required to be surveyed at least once per five-year class cycle, unless shorter intervals between surveys are otherwise prescribed. All ships are also required to be dry-docked at least once during every five-year class cycle for inspection of their underwater parts and for repairs related to inspections. If any defects are found, the classification surveyor will issue a "recommendation" which must be rectified by the ship owner within prescribed time limits. We intend to dry-dock our ships at five-year intervals that coincide with the completion of the ship's special survey.
Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a ship be certified as "in class" by a classification society that is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies. All but one of our delivered ships is certified by the American Bureau of Shipping, or "ABS"; the other delivered ship is certified by the Det Norske Veritas. Each ship has been awarded International Safety Management ("ISM") certification and is currently "in class". Under our shipbuilding contracts, all of our contracted newbuildings must be certified prior to delivery to us.
The following table lists the years in which we expect to carry out the next or initial dry-dockings and special surveys for our owned fleet and the bareboat vessel as of December 31, 2016:

Risk of Loss, Insurance and Risk Management
The operation of any ship has inherent risks. These risks include mechanical failure, personal injury, collision, property loss or damage, ship or cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to a number of reasons, including mechanical failure, political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities and labor strikes. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of marine disaster, including explosion, spills and other environmental mishaps, and the liabilities arising from owning and operating ships in international trade.
We maintain hull and machinery insurance on all our owned ships against marine and war risks in amounts that we believe to be prudent to cover such risks, as well as loss of hire insurance against loss of income as a result of a ship being off-hire or otherwise suffering a loss of operational time for events falling under our hull and machinery insurance. In addition, we maintain protection and indemnity insurance on all our owned ships up to the maximum insurable limit available at any given time. We also maintain ship manager insurance in respect of our managed fleet. While we believe that our insurance coverage will be adequate, not all risks can be insured, and there can be no guarantee that we will always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates or at all, or that any specific claim we may make under our insurance coverage will be paid.
Hull & Machinery Marine Risks Insurance and Hull & Machinery War Risks Insurance
We maintain hull and machinery marine risks insurance and hull and machinery war risks insurance on our owned ships, which cover loss of or damage to a ship due to marine perils such as collisions, fire or lightning, and loss of or damage to a ship due to war perils such as acts of war, terrorism or piracy. Each of our ships is insured under these policies for a total amount that exceeds what we believe to be its fair market value. We also maintain hull disbursements and increased value insurance policies covering each of our owned ships, which provide additional coverage in the event of the total or constructive loss of a ship. Our marine risks insurance policies contain deductible amounts for which we will be responsible, but there are no deductible amounts under our war risks policies or our total loss policies.
Loss o f Hire Insurance/Delay Insurance
We maintain loss of hire insurance to protect us against loss of income as a result of a ship being off-hire or otherwise suffering a loss of operational time for events falling under the terms of our hull and machinery insurance or hull and machinery/war risks insurance. Under our loss of hire policy, our insurer will pay us the hire rate agreed in respect of each ship for each day, in excess of a certain number of deductible days, for the time that the ship is out of service as a result of damage, for a maximum of 180 days. The number of deductible days for the ships in our fleet is 14 days per ship. In addition to the loss of hire insurance, we also have in place delay insurance which, like loss of hire, covers all of our owned vessels for time lost due to events falling under the terms of our hull and machinery insurance, plus additional protection and indemnity related incidents. The policy has a deductible of two days with a maximum of 12 days (which brings it in line with the loss of hire deductible of 14 days) and a daily rate per vessel of $40,000 for our wholly owned vessels or the hire rate agreed as per the loss of hire insurance policy for the Partnership's vessels.
Additionally, we buy piracy loss of hire and kidnap and ransom insurance when our ships are ordered to sail through the Indian Ocean to insure against potential losses relating to the hijacking of a ship and its crew by pirates.
Protection and Indemnity Insurance
Protection and indemnity insurance is typically provided by a protection and indemnity association, or "P&I association", and covers third-party liability, crew liability and other related expenses resulting from injury to or death of crew, passengers and other third parties, loss of or damage to cargo, third-party claims arising from collisions with other ships (to the extent not recovered by the hull and machinery policies), damage to other third-party property, pollution arising from oil or other substances and salvage, towing and other related costs, including wreck removal.

Our protection and indemnity insurance covering our owned ships is provided by P&I associations that are members of the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs, or "International Group". The thirteen P&I associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90.0% of the world's commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association's liabilities. Insurance provided by a P&I association is a form of mutual indemnity insurance.
Our protection and indemnity insurance is currently subject to limits of $3 billion per ship per event in respect of liability to passengers and seamen, $2 billion per ship per event in respect of liability to passengers, and $ 1 billion per ship per event in respect of liability for oil pollution.
As a member of a P&I association, we will be subject to calls payable to the P&I association based on the International Group's claim records as well as the claim records of all other members of the P&I association of which we are a member.
Safety Performance
We provide intensive onboard training for our officers and crews to instill a culture of the highest operational and safety standards. During 2016, GasLog's fleet experienced one lost time injury.
Permits and Authorizations
We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses, financial assurances and certificates with respect to our ships. The kinds of permits, licenses, financial assurances and certificates required will depend upon several factors, including the waters in which the ship operates, the nationality of the ship's crew and the age of the ship. We have obtained all permits, licenses, financial assurances and certificates currently required to operate our ships. Additional laws and regulations, environmental or otherwise, may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost of our doing business.
Environmental and Other Regulation
The carriage, handling, storage and regasification of LNG are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety and other matters. These laws and regulations include international conventions and national, state and local laws and regulations in the countries where our ships now or in the future will operate, or where our ships are registered. Compliance with these laws and regulations may entail significant expenses and may impact the resale value or useful lives of our ships. Our ships may be subject to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections by a variety of governmental, quasi-governmental and private organizations, including the local port authorities, national authorities, harbor masters or equivalent, classification societies, flag state administrations (countries of registry) and charterers. Failure to maintain permits, licenses, certificates or other authorizations required by some of these entities could require us to incur substantial costs or result in the temporary suspension of the operation of one or more of our ships or lead to the invalidation of our insurance coverage reduction.
We believe that our ships operate in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our ships in operation have all material permits, licenses, certificates or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. In fact, each of our ships have an ENVIRO, an ENVIRO+ or a CLEAN notation from our classification societies, which denote compliance with their published guidelines concerning stringent criteria for environmental protection related to design characteristics, management and support systems, sea discharges and air emissions. Because environmental laws and regulations are frequently changed and may impose increasingly stricter requirements, however, it is difficult to accurately predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our ships. Moreover, additional legislation or regulation applicable to the operation of our ships that may be implemented in the future could negatively affect our profitability.

International Maritime Regulations
The IMO, the United Nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of pollution by ships, has adopted several international conventions that regulate the international shipping industry, including the SOLAS Convention, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, and the MARPOL Convention. Ships that transport gas, including LNG carriers, are also subject to regulations under amendments to SOLAS implementing the International Code for Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk, or the "IGC Code", and the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention, or the "ISM Code". The ISM Code requires, among other things, that the party with operational control of a ship develop an extensive safety management system, including the adoption of a policy for safety and environmental protection setting forth instructions and procedures for operating its ships safely and also describing procedures for responding to emergencies. Through GasLog LNG Services, we have developed a safety management system for our ships that meets these requirements. The IGC Code prescribes design and construction standards for ships involved in the transport of gas. Compliance with the IGC Code must be evidenced by a Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Liquefied Gases of Bulk. Each of our ships is in compliance with the IGC Code and each of our newbuilding contracts requires that the ship receive certification that it is in compliance with applicable regulations before it is delivered. Non-compliance with the IGC Code or other applicable IMO regulations may subject a ship owner or a bareboat charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected ships and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports.
The MARPOL Convention establishes environmental standards relating to oil leakage or spilling, garbage management, sewage, air emissions, handling and disposal of noxious liquids and the handling of harmful substances in packaged form. In September 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL to address air pollution from ships. Annex VI came into force on May 19, 2005. It sets limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons. Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions. Annex VI has been ratified by many, but not all, IMO member states. In October 2008, the Marine Environment Protection Committee, or "MEPC", of the IMO approved amendments to Annex VI regarding particulate matter, nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions standards. These amendments became effective in July 2010. These requirements establish a series of progressive standards to further limit the sulfur content in fuel oil, which are being phased in between 2012 and 2020, and by establishing new tiers of nitrogen oxide emission standards for new marine diesel engines, depending on their date of installation. Additionally, more stringent emission standards could apply in coastal areas designated as Emission Control Areas, or "ECAs". For example, "Tier III" emission standards apply in North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECAs to all marine diesel engines installed on a ship constructed after January 1, 2016. The European Union Directive 2005/EC/33, which became effective on January 1, 2010, parallels Annex VI and requires ships to use reduced sulfur content fuel for their main and auxiliary engines. Our owned ships currently in operation comply with the relevant legislation and have the relevant certificates including certificates evidencing compliance with Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention.
Although the United States is not a party, many countries have ratified the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, or the "CLC". Under this convention a ship's registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject under certain circumstances to certain defenses and limitations. Ships carrying more than 2,000 gross tons of oil, and trading to states that are parties to this convention, must maintain evidence of insurance in an amount covering the liability of the owner. In jurisdictions where the CLC has not been adopted, various legislative schemes or common law impose liability either on the basis of fault or in a manner similar to the CLC.
51

The IMO also has adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, or the "Bunker Convention", which imposes liability on ship owners for pollution damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of bunker fuel and requires registered owners of ships over 1,000 gross tons to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime. We maintain insurance in respect of our owned ships that satisfies these requirements.
Noncompliance with the ISM Code or with other IMO regulations may subject a ship owner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected ships and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports, including United States and European Union ports.
United States
O il P ollution A ct and CERCLA
Because our ships could trade with the United States or its territories or possessions and/or operate in U.S. waters, our operations could be impacted by OPA, which establishes an extensive regulatory and liability regime for environmental protection and cleanup of oil spills, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or "CERCLA", which imposes liability on owners and operators of ships for cleanup and natural resource damage from the release of hazardous substances (other than oil). Under OPA, ship owners, operators and bareboat charterers are responsible parties who are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from oil spills from their ships. OPA currently limits the liability of responsible parties with respect to ships over 3,000 gross tons to the greater of $2,000 per gross ton or $17,088,000 per double hull ship and permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters. Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5.0 million for ships carrying a hazardous substance as cargo and the greater of $300 per gross ton or $0.5 million for any other ship.
These limits of liability do not apply under certain circumstances, however, such as where the incident is caused by violation of applicable U.S. Federal safety, construction or operating regulations, or by the responsible party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. In addition, a marine incident that results in significant damage to the environment could result in amendments to these limitations or other regulatory changes in the future. We maintain the maximum pollution liability coverage amount of $1 billion per incident for our owned ships. We also believe that we will be in substantial compliance with OPA, CERCLA and all applicable state regulations in the ports where our ships will call.
OPA also requires owners and operators of ships to establish and maintain with the National Pollution Fund Center of the U.S. Coast Guard evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the limit of their potential strict liability under the act. Such financial responsibility can be demonstrated by providing a guarantee from an appropriate guarantor, who can release the required guarantee to the National Pollution Fund Center against payment of the requested premium. We have purchased such a guarantee in order to provide evidence of financial responsibility and have received the mandatory certificates of financial responsibility from the U.S. Coast Guard in respect of all of our delivered ships, we intend to obtain such certificates in the future for each of our vessels, if required to have them.
Clean W ater A ct
The U.S. Clean Water Act of 1972, or "CWA", prohibits the discharge of oil, hazardous substances and ballast water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a duly-issued permit or exemption, and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and
52

complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA. Furthermore, most U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. Federal law.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency, or "EPA", has enacted rules requiring ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain ships within United States waters to be authorized under the Ship General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of Ships, or the "VGP". To be covered by the VGP, owners of certain ships must submit a Notice of Intent, or "NOI", at least 30 days before the ship operates in United States waters. Compliance with the VGP could require the installation of equipment on our ships to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other disposal arrangements, and/or otherwise restrict our ships from entering United States waters. In March 2013, the EPA published a VGP that includes numeric effluent limits for ballast water expressed as the maximum concentration of living organisms in ballast water. These VGP requirements also are the subject of litigation by certain environmental groups seeking more stringent ballast water requirements. In addition, the VGP also imposes a variety of changes for non-ballast water discharges including more stringent Best Management Practices for discharges of oil-to-sea interfaces in an effort to reduce the toxicity of oil leaked into U.S. water. We have submitted NOIs for all of our delivered ships and intend to submit NOIs for our ships in the future, where required, and do not believe that the costs associated with obtaining and complying with the VGP will have a significant impact on our operations.
Clean A ir A ct
The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 and 1990, or the "CAA", requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. Our ships may be subject to vapor control and recovery requirements for certain cargoes when loading, unloading, ballasting, cleaning and conducting other operations in regulated port areas and emission standards for so-called "Category 3" marine diesel engines operating in U.S. waters. The marine diesel engine emission standards are currently limited to new engines beginning with the 2004 model year. On April 30, 2010, the EPA adopted final emission standards for Category 3 marine diesel engines equivalent to those adopted in the amendments to Annex VI to MARPOL. However, our tri-fuel diesel electric LNG carriers have the ability to burn natural gas as fuel to power the ship, which can significantly reduce relevant emissions compared with steam-powered ships.
The CAA also requires states to adopt State Implementation Plans, or "SIPs", designed to attain national health-based air quality standards in primarily major metropolitan and/or industrial areas. Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting from ship loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. The MEPC has designated as an ECA the area extending 200 miles from the territorial sea baseline adjacent to the Atlantic/Gulf and Pacific coasts and the eight main Hawaiian Islands and the Baltic Sea, North Sea and Caribbean Sea, under the Annex VI amendments. Fuel used by vessels operating in the ECA cannot exceed 0.10% sulfur. As of January 1, 2016, NOx after-treatment requirements also apply. Our vessels can store and burn low-sulfur fuel oil or alternatively burn natural gas which contains no sulfur. Additionally, burning natural gas will ensure compliance with IMO Tier III NOx emission limitations without the need for after-treatment. Charterers must supply compliant fuel for the vessels before ordering vessels to trade in areas where restrictions apply. As a result, we do not expect such restrictions to have a materially adverse impact on our operations or costs.
Other Environmental Initiatives
U.S. Coast Guard regulations adopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act, or "NISA", impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all ships equipped with ballast water tanks entering U.S. waters, which could require the installation of equipment on our ships to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal
53

arrangements or procedures, and/or otherwise restrict our ships from entering U.S. waters. In June 2012, the U.S. Coast Guard rule establishing standards for the allowable concentration of living organisms in ballast water discharged in U.S. waters and requiring the phase-in of Coast Guard approved ballast water management systems, or "BWMS", became effective. The rule requires installation of Coast Guard approved BWMS (none of which have received full approval by the Coast Guard to date) by new vessels constructed on or after December 1, 2013 and existing vessels as of their first dry-docking after January 1, 2016. Several states have adopted legislation and regulations relating to the permitting and management of ballast water discharges.
At the international level, the IMO adopted an International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments in February 2004, or the "BWM Convention". The BWM Convention's implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits. The threshold ratification requirements for the convention to enter into force were met earlier in 2016, and the convention will become effective on September 8, 2017. While we believe that our delivered ships comply with existing requirements, when these new ballast water treatment requirements are instituted, the cost of compliance could increase for ocean carriers. It is difficult to accurately predict the overall impact of such a requirement on our operations.
Our vessels may also become subject to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, 1996 as amended by the Protocol to the HNS Convention, adopted in April 2010, or "HNS Convention," if it is entered into force. The HNS Convention creates a regime of liability and compensation for damage from hazardous and noxious substances, or "HNS", including a two-tier system of compensation composed of compulsory insurance taken out by shipowners and HNS Fund which comes into play when the insurance is insufficient to satisfy a claim or does not cover the incident. To date, the HNS Convention has not been ratified by a sufficient number of countries to enter into force.
Greenhouse Gas R egulations
The MEPC of IMO adopted two new sets of mandatory requirements to address greenhouse gas emissions from ships at its July 2011 meeting. The Energy Efficiency Design Index requires a minimum energy efficiency level per capacity mile and is applicable to new vessels, and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan is applicable to currently operating vessels. The requirements, which entered into force in January 2013, were fully implemented by GasLog as of December 31, 2012. The IMO is also considering the development of a market-based mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions from ships, but it is impossible to predict the likelihood that such a standard might be adopted or its potential impact on our operations at this time.
The European Union has indicated that it intends to propose an expansion of the existing European Union emissions trading scheme to include emissions of greenhouse gases from marine ships. Requirements to monitor, report and verify carbon dioxide emissions from vessels calling to EU ports are under contemplation for adoption by the European Parliament. In the United States, the EPA has issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and safety and has adopted regulations under the CAA to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain mobile sources and large stationary sources. Although the mobile source emissions do not apply to greenhouse gas emissions from ships, the EPA is considering a petition from the California Attorney General and environmental groups to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from ocean-going ships. Any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, the European Union, the United States or other countries where we operate, or any new treaty adopted at the international level, that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant financial expenditures that we cannot predict with certainty at this time.
We believe that LNG carriers, which have the inherent ability to burn natural gas to power the ship, and in particular LNG carriers like ours that utilize fuel-efficient diesel electric propulsion, can be considered among the cleanest of large ships in terms of emissions.

Ship Security Regulations
A number of initiatives have been introduced in recent years intended to enhance ship security. On November 25, 2002, the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, or "MTSA", was signed into law. To implement certain portions of the MTSA, the U.S. Coast Guard issued regulations in July 2003 requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard ships operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Similarly, in December 2002, amendments to SOLAS created a new chapter of the convention dealing specifically with maritime security. This new chapter came into effect in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on ships and port authorities, most of which are contained in the newly created International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code, or "ISPS Code". Among the various requirements are:
· on-board installation of automatic information systems to enhance ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communications; · on-board installation of ship security alert systems; · the development of ship security plans; and · compliance with flag state security certification requirements.
The U.S. Coast Guard regulations, intended to align with international maritime security standards, exempt non-U.S. ships from MTSA ship security measures, provided such ships have on board a valid "International Ship Security Certificate" that attests to the ship's compliance with SOLAS security requirements and the ISPS Code. We have implemented the various security measures required by the IMO, SOLAS and the ISPS Code and have approved ISPS certificates and plans certified by the applicable flag state on board all our ships.

We are an international owner, operator and manager of LNG carriers. Our wholly owned fleet consists of 18 LNG carriers, including 13 ships in operation, three LNG carriers on order at Samsung and two LNG carriers on order at Hyundai. GasLog is also the general and controlling partner in GasLog Partners, which owns nine LNG carriers, and GasLog has leased back one vessel sold to Lepta Shipping in February 2016, for a period of up to 20 years. We currently manage and operate 24 LNG carriers including 12 of our wholly owned vessels in operation (one is managed by a subsidiary of Shell), the nine ships contributed or sold to the Partnership, the bareboat vessel, one ship owned by MSL and one additional LNG carrier in which we have a 25.0% interest. We are also supervising the construction of our newbuildings. We have secured multi-year and seasonal time charter contracts for eight of our operating ships, the nine ships owned by the Partnership, the bareboat vessel and our five newbuildings on order, while five of our ships are operating in the spot/short-term market. As of December 31, 2016 these contracts are expected to provide total contracted revenue of $3.6 billion during their initial terms, which expire between 2018 and 2029.
We also have a 25.0% interest in an additional ship, the M e th a n e N ile E a g le , a 2007-built LNG carrier owned by Egypt LNG and technically managed by us. It is currently operating under a 20-year time charter to a subsidiary of Shell. The information about our owned fleet presented in this report does not include our ownership interest in the M e th a n e N ile E a g le.
We generate revenues by chartering our ships to customers on multi-year time charters, seasonal time charters and spot/short-term charters and by providing technical ship management services, including crewing, training, maintenance, regulatory and classification compliance and HSSE management and reporting through our wholly owned subsidiary GasLog LNG Services. The Group's chief operating decision maker (the "CODM") being the Chief Executive Officer, reviews the Group's operating results on a consolidated basis as one operating segment.
Known Trends
As referenced in the Risk Factors above, global crude oil prices have been depressed since 2014. This has in turn applied downward pressure on natural gas prices and led to a narrowing of the gap in pricing in different geographic regions, which has adversely affected the length of voyages in the spot LNG shipping market and the spot rates and medium term charter rates for charters which commence in the near future.
In the shorter-term shipping market in the fourth quarter 2016, brokers reported that spot rates in the Atlantic Basin increased to approximately $45,000 per day, with one end of year fixture reported above $50,000. The catalyst was greater ton-mile demand with many cargoes going from the U.S. to Asia through the Panama Canal. Spot charter terms have also improved with round trip economics now seen on some short term voyages. In the Pacific Basin, reported rates were lower at around $38,000 per day than the Atlantic, largely due to the greater availability of vessels during the period.
During the fourth quarter of 2016, U.S. natural gas prices increased 30% to $4 per million British thermal units ("mmbtu"). However, Northeast Asian LNG prices rose by 60% to approximately $10 per mmbtu due to a cold start to winter in key demand centers such as Japan, China and Korea. Destination flexibility allowed offtakers to send more LNG cargos to Asia, which increased ton-mile demand. For 2016 in total, there were approximately 275 short term fixtures, an increase of more than 50% over 2015. Whilst it is too early to predict a sustained recovery we believe that fundamentals continue to point to a recovery, through 2017 and beyond.
56

In the longer term, there remain uncertainties in the legacy of several years of low oil prices: oil may undermine natural gas as a fuel for power generation, although natural gas may in turn become more attractive than coal, nuclear and renewables. Amidst this uncertainty, some production companies have announced delays or cancellations of previously-announced LNG projects that, unless offset by new projects coming on stream, could adversely affect demand for LNG charters over the next few years. And although there is broad market consensus that LNG ship demand is expected to outstrip ship supply over the next few years, delays to start up or unexpected downtime of LNG supply projects may reduce demand and increase supply. Reduced demand for LNG or LNG shipping, or any reduction or limitation in LNG production capacity, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure future time charters at attractive rates and durations upon expiration or early termination of our current charter arrangements, for any ships for which we have not yet secured charters or for any new ships we acquire, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to shareholders.
Depending on prevailing LNG charter market conditions, we may have difficulty in securing renewed or new charters at attractive rates and durations on ships when their multi-year charters expire. Such a failure could adversely affect our future liquidity, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to shareholders, as well as our ability to meet certain of our debt covenants. A sustained decline in charter rates could also adversely affect the market value of our ships, on which certain of the ratios and financial covenants we are required to comply with are based. However, in 2017, we expect projects coming onstream will add approximately 25 million tonnes (annualized, mtpa) of new liquefaction capacity in both Australia and the U.S., and a further -100 mtpa from 2018 to 2020. Although much of the shipping required to transport this additional volume has been contracted and is currently under construction, encouraging levels of tendering activity are being noted and we continue to see a future shortfall of vessels that will be required for the Australian and U.S. projects that have taken final investment decision ("FID").
In the fourth quarter 2016, there were several announcements which highlighted continued growth of LNG supply and shipping demand. BP committed to purchase 100% of the LNG produced by ENI's Coral South Floating LNG ("FLNG") facility. The facility is expected to be installed offshore Mozambique and to have a capacity of approximately 3.3 million tonnes per annum ("mtpa"). This commitment allowed ENI to authorize development of the project. BP also announced an investment of approximately $1 billion to develop gas reserves offshore Mauritania and Senegal and to create a new LNG hub in Africa. PETRONAS' 1.2 mtpa Malaysian FLNG facility was one of eight LNG liquefaction projects that successfully came online in 2016 (others include Sabine Pass, Australia Pacific, Gladstone and Gorgon). Total announced a $207 million investment in Tellurian's Driftwood LNG project. Finally, the rising LNG supply in the quarter was slightly offset by a supply outage at Chevron's Gorgon facility where Train 1 was shut down for maintenance.
During the quarter, there were also several announcements for new FSRUs. These projects continue the trend of new and existing importing nations selecting FSRUs, which are typically quicker to market and more flexible than land-based terminals.
Global Energy Infrastructure Limited signed a 20-year FSRU charter for its LNG import project in Port Qasim, Pakistan. This will be the third FSRU in Port Qasim, demonstrating the growing demand in the region. The CI-GNL (Ivory Coast LNG) consortium led by Total was awarded the rights to build and operate a 3 mtpa FSRU in the Ivory Coast. The Brazilian gas-to-power Porto de Sergipe Project took FID. In connection with the FID, the project's sponsor entered into a 25-year FSRU charter agreement. Also in the quarter, Turkey chartered its first FSRU, the GDF Suez Neptune, from the French utility company Engie. There were seven new FSRU awards during the year, a significant increase on previous years, demonstrating the growing demand for offshore re-gasification infrastructure. This compares to around 20 existing FSRU projects in operation around the world today.

A. Operating Results
Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations We believe the principal factors that will affect our future results of operations include: · the number of LNG carriers in our owned and managed fleets; · the timely delivery of our ships under construction; · our ability to maintain good working relationships with our existing customers and our ability to increase the number of our customers through the development of new working relationships; · the performance of our charterers; · the supply-demand relationship for LNG shipping services; · our ability to successfully re-employ the ships we own, including our LNG carriers on order, at economically attractive rates; · the effective and efficient technical management of the ships under our management; · our ability to obtain acceptable debt financing in respect of our capital commitments; · our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and to satisfy technical, health, safety and compliance standards that meet our customers' requirements; and · economic, regulatory, political and governmental conditions that affect shipping and the LNG industry, which include changes in the number of new LNG importing countries and regions, as well as structural LNG market changes impacting LNG supply that may allow greater flexibility and competition of other energy sources with global LNG use. In addition to the general factors discussed above, we believe certain specific factors have impacted, or will impact, our results of operations.
These factors include: · the hire rate earned by our owned ships; · unscheduled off-hire days; · the fees we receive for construction supervision and technical ship management services; · the level of our ship operating expenses, including crewing costs, insurance and maintenance costs; · our access to capital required to acquire additional ships and/or to implement our business strategy; · our level of debt, the related interest expense and the timing of required payments of principal; · mark-to-market changes in interest rate swaps and foreign currency fluctuations; and · the level of our general and administrative expenses, including salaries and costs of consultants.
Principal Components of Revenues and Expenses
Revenues Our revenues are driven primarily by the number of LNG carriers in our owned fleet, the amount of daily charter hire that they earn under time
charters and the number of operating days during which they generate revenues. These factors, in turn, are affected by our decisions relating to ship acquisitions and disposals, the amount of time that our ships spend in dry-dock undergoing repairs, maintenance and upgrade work, the age, condition and technical specifications of our ships as well as the relative levels of supply and demand in the LNG carrier charter market. Under the terms of some of our time charter arrangements, the operating cost component of the daily hire rate is intended to correspond to the costs of operating the ship. Accordingly, we will receive additional revenue under certain of our time charters through an annual escalation of the operating cost
58

component of the daily hire rate and, in the event of more material increases in a ship's operating costs, we may be entitled to receive additional revenues under those charters. Under some of the other time charter arrangements, most of our operating costs are passed-through to the charterer in the form of an adjustment to the operating cost component of the daily hire rate. We believe these adjustment provisions provide substantial protection against significant cost increases. See "Item 4. Information on the Company--B. Business Overview-- Ship Time Charters--Hire Rate Provisions" for a more detailed discussion of the hire rate provisions of our charter contracts.
Our LNG carriers are employed through time charter contracts. Revenues under our time charters are recognized when services are performed, revenue is earned and the collection of the revenue is reasonably assured. The charter hire revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant time charter. We do not recognize revenue during days when the ship is off-hire, unless it is recoverable from insurers. Advance payments under time charter contracts are classified as liabilities until such time as the criteria for recognizing the revenue are met.
The table below provides additional information about our contracted charter revenues based on contracts in effect as of December 31, 2016 for (a) the eight ships in our wholly owned fleet, the nine ships in the GasLog Partners' fleet and the bareboat vessel for which we have secured time charters and (b) our five newbuildings on order. Other than the assumptions reflected in the footnotes to the table, including our assumption that our newbuildings are delivered on schedule, the table does not reflect events occurring after December 31, 2016. The table reflects only our contracted charter revenues for the ships in our owned fleet for which we have secured time charters, and it does not reflect the costs or expenses we will incur in fulfilling our obligations under the charters, nor does it include other revenues we may earn, such as revenues for technical management of customer-owned ships. In particular, the table does not reflect any revenues from the GasLog Singapore, the GasLog Chelsea, the GasLog Savannah, the GasLog Saratoga and the GasLog Salem that are operating in the Cool Pool, any additional ships we may acquire in the future, nor does it reflect the options under our time charters that permit our charterers to extend the time charter terms for successive multi-year periods. The entry into time charter contracts for the GasLog Singapore, the GasLog Chelsea, the GasLog Savannah, the GasLog Saratoga, the GasLog Salem and any additional ships we may acquire or the exercise of options extending the terms of our existing charters, would result in an increase in the number of contracted days and the contracted revenue for our fleet in the future. Although the contracted charter revenues are based on contracted charter hire rate provisions, they reflect certain assumptions, including assumptions relating to future ship operating costs. We consider the assumptions to be reasonable as of the date of this report, but if these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual time charter revenues could differ from those reflected in the table. Furthermore, any contract is subject to various risks, including performance by the counterparties or an early termination of the contract pursuant to its terms. If the charterers are unable or unwilling to make charter payments to us, or if we agree to renegotiate charter terms at the request of a charterer or if contracts are prematurely terminated for any reason, we would be exposed to prevailing market conditions at the time, and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Please see "Item 3. Key Information--D. Risk Factors". For these reasons, the contracted charter revenue information presented below is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information. Neither the Company's independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the information presented in the table, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the information in the table.

111 Reflects time charter revenues and contracted days for eight o f our wholly owned ships, the nine ships owned by the Partnership, the bareboat vessel, and our five newbuildings on order for which we have secured time charters. Does not include charter revenues for the vessels operating in the spot/short-term market under the Cool Pool agreement and the Methane Nile Eagle, in which we hold a 25.0% minority interest. Contracted revenue calculations assume: (a) 365 revenue days per annum, with 30 off-hire days when the ship undergoes scheduled dry-docking (every five years); (b) all LNG carriers on order are delivered on schedule; and (c) no exercise o f any option to extend the terms of charters. For time charters that include a fixed operating cost component subject to annual escalation, revenue calculations include that fixed annual escalation. For time charters that give the charterer the option to set the charter hire rate at prevailing market rates during an initial portion o f the time charter's term, revenue calculations assume that the charterer does not elect such option. Revenue calculations for such charters include an estimate o f the amount of the operating cost component and the management fee component.
Available days represent total calendar days after deducting 30 off-hire days when the ship undergoes scheduled dry-docking. The available days for the vessels operating in the spot/short-term market are included.
131 Represents available days for ships after the expiration of existing charters (assuming charterers do not exercise any option to extend the terms o f the charters) and the available days for the vessels operating in the spot/short-term market.
The revenues of GasLog LNG Services, our wholly owned subsidiary, are driven primarily by the number of ships operating under our technical management and the amount of the fees we earn for each of these ships as well as the amount of fees that we may earn for plan approval and construction supervision of newbuilding LNG carriers. In addition to revenues from external customers, GasLog LNG Services receives revenues for technical management, plan approval and construction supervision services provided to our owned fleet, which are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue from ship management and ship construction project supervision contracts is recognized in the statement of profit or loss when earned and when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to us and such benefits can be measured reliably.

Vessel Operating and Supervision Costs
We are generally responsible for ship operating expenses, which include costs for crewing, insurance, repairs, modifications and maintenance, including dry-docking, lubricants, spare parts and consumable stores and other miscellaneous expenses, as well as the associated cost of providing these items and services. However, as described above, the hire rate provisions of our time charters are intended to reflect the operating costs borne by us. Our charters contain provisions that significantly reduce our exposure to increases in operating costs, including review provisions and cost pass-through provisions. Ship operating expenses are recognized as expenses when incurred.
In addition, we pay fees to GasLog LNG Services in connection with our own newbuildings on order for plan approval and construction supervision services provided by GasLog LNG Services and to cover third-party expenses incurred by GasLog LNG Services in respect of the newbuildings. These fees, other than any inter-segment profit, are capitalized as part of the asset value of our ships. The fees paid for technical ship management services, which are considered vessel operating and supervision costs of our owned fleet (and corresponding revenues of GasLog LNG Services), are eliminated on consolidation.
Vessel operating and supervision costs of GasLog LNG Services include staff costs, such as salaries, social security and training for the technical management team and project specialists, and project-related expenses.
60

Voyage Expenses and Commissions
Under our time charter arrangements, charterers bear substantially all voyage expenses, including bunker fuel, port charges and canal tolls, but not commissions, which we have historically paid to unaffiliated ship brokers based on a flat fee per ship. Commissions are recognized as expenses on a pro rata basis over the duration of the period of the time charter.
Vessel operating costs and voyage expenses and commissions are expensed as incurred, with the exception of commissions, which are recognized on a pro-rata basis over the duration of the period of the time charter. Bunkers consumption represents mainly bunkers consumed during vessels' unemployment and off-hire.
Furthermore, in relation to the vessels participating in the Cool Pool, voyage expenses and commissions include the net allocation from the pool which represents GasLog's share of the net revenues earned from the other pool participants' vessels less the other participants' share of the net revenues earned by GasLog's vessels included in the pool. Each participant's share of the net pool revenues is based on the number of pool points attributable to its vessels and the number of days such vessels participated in the pool.
Depreciation
The majority of our consolidated depreciation expenses relate to the cost of our ships. We depreciate the cost of our ships on the basis of two components: a vessel component and a dry-docking component. The vessel component is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of each ship, based on the cost of the ship less its estimated residual value. We estimate the useful lives of our ships to be 35 years from the date of delivery from the shipyard. Secondhand vessels are depreciated from the date of their acquisition through their remaining estimated useful life. Management estimates residual value of its vessels to be equal to the product of its lightweight tonnage ("LWT"), and an estimated scrap rate per LWT, which represents our estimate of the market value of the ship at the end of its useful life. We review scrap rates on an annual basis.
We must periodically dry-dock each of our ships for inspection, repairs and maintenance and any modifications to comply with industry certification or governmental requirements. All our ships are required to be dry-docked for these inspections at least once every five years. At the time of delivery of a ship, we estimate the dry-docking component of the cost of the ship, which represents the estimated cost of the ship's first dry docking based on our historical experience with similar types of ships. The dry-docking component of the ship's cost is depreciated over five years, in case of new ships, and until the next dry-docking for secondhand ships, unless we determine to dry-dock the ships at an earlier date. In the event a ship is dry-docked at an earlier date, the unamortized dry-docking component is written off immediately.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel costs for administrative and support staff, board of directors fees, expense recognized in connection with share-based compensation, rent, utilities, travel expenses, legal expenses, other professional services and consultants, training for crew familiarization and other advisor costs.
Financial Costs
We incur interest expense on the outstanding indebtedness under our existing credit facilities, Bonds and our swap arrangements that qualify for treatment as cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes, which we include in our financial costs. Financial costs also include amortization of other loan issuance costs incurred in connection with establishing our credit facilities. We will incur additional interest expense and other borrowing costs in the future on our outstanding borrowings and under the undrawn or future borrowings and commitments. For a description of our credit facilities, including our loan agreements, see "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-- B. Liquidity and Capital Resources--Credit Facilities".
61

Interest expense and the amortization of loan issuance costs that relate directly to a specific loan to finance a LNG carrier under construction and are incurred during the construction period are capitalized as part of the cost of the ship. Otherwise, interest expense and amortization of loan issuance costs are expensed as incurred.

Financial Income
Financial income consists of interest income, which will depend on the level of our cash deposits, investments and prevailing interest rates. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis.

Gain/(Loss) on Interest Rate Swaps
Any gain or loss derived from the fair value of the swaps at their inception, the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the swaps that meet hedge accounting criteria, net interest on interest rate swaps held for trading, the movement in the fair value of the interest rate swaps that have not been designated as hedges and the amortization of the cumulative unrealized loss for the interest rate swaps that hedge accounting was discontinued are presented as gain or loss on interest rate swaps in our consolidated statements of profit or loss.

Share o f Profit o f Associate
The share of profit of associate consists of our share of profits from our 25.0% ownership interest in Egypt LNG, a Bermuda exempted company whose principal asset is the LNG carrier Methane Nile Eagle.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had an average of 20.7 ships operating in our owned and bareboat fleet (including ships owned by the Partnership), having 7,439 operating days and an average of 23.6 ships operating under our technical management (including 19.7 of our owned and bareboat ships). During the year ended December 31, 2015, we had an average of 18.2 ships operating in our owned fleet having 6,097 operating days and an average of 21.7 ships operating under our technical management (including 17.2 of our owned ships).
Revenues: Revenues increased by 12.28%, or $50.98 million, from $415.08 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $466.06 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The
62

increase is mainly attributable to an increase in revenues of $66.08 million due to the full operation of the Methane Becki Anne and the Methane Julia Louise which were both acquired from BG Group on March 31, 2015 and the deliveries of the CasLog Greece, the GasLog Glasgow, the GasLog Geneva and the GasLog Gibraltar on March 29, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and October 31, 2016, respectively. These acquisitions and deliveries resulted in an increase in operating days. There was also an increase in revenues of $8.97 million caused mainly by the fewer off-hire days due to scheduled dry-dockings of our vessels in 2016 as compared to 2015. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a decrease of $24.68 million due to the expiration of two charter party agreements in 2016 and a decrease of $1.25 million in earnings from our vessels operating in the spot market, mitigated by a net increase of $2.62 million in revenues from the remaining vessels. The daily hire rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $67,650 as compared to $62,400 for the year ended December 31, 2016 affected by the decline in the spot market. There was also a decrease of $0.76 million in revenues from technical management services mainly due to the decrease in the average number of the managed vessels owned by third parties following the acquisition of the two vessels from BG Group.
Vessel Operating and Supervision Costs: Vessel operating and supervision costs increased by 14.29%, or $14.08 million, from $98.55 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $112.63 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase in our fleet in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015, as described above, combined with an increase in scheduled technical maintenance expenses such as scheduled main engine overhaulings, various planned repairs, as well as other regulatory periodical certifications, partially offset by decreased vessels' tax and crew social contributions. As a result, the average daily operating cost per vessel increased from $14,847 per day in 2015 to $15,253 per day in 2016.
Voyage Expenses and Commissions: Voyage and commission expenses increased by 6.23%, or $0.89 million, from $14.29 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $15.18 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly attributable to the increased operating days in the year ended December 31, 2016 affecting the commissions on revenue.
Depreciation: Depreciation increased by 15.30%, or $16.32 million, from $106.64 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $122.96 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in depreciation resulted mainly from the increase in the average number of vessels in our fleet in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015.
General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses decreased by 6.40%, or $2.64 million, from $41.28 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $38.64 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is mainly attributable to a decrease of $4.21 million in legal fees and other professional services relating mainly to consultancy fees recorded in 2015, which was partially offset by an increase of $1.00 million in non-cash share-based compensation expense and an increase of $0.55 million in net foreign exchange losses.
Financial Costs: Financial costs increased by 49.33%, or $45.36 million, from $91.96 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, to $137.32 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is attributable to (a) an increase of $23.79 million in the amortization of deferred loan fees, mainly driven by (i) a write-off of $18.21 million of unamortized loan fees associated with the six legacy facilities that were refinanced by the Legacy Facility Refinancing, (ii) a $1.84 million write-off of unamortized bond fees and premium as a result of the re-purchase and cancellation of NOK 588 million of bonds in June 2016, (iii) an increase of $2.51 million in the refinanced loan facilities and Bonds and (iv) an increase of $1.23 million in the facilities drawn during 2016, (b) an increase of $8.63 million in interest expense on loans, Bonds and cash flow hedges, (c) an increase of $9.37 million due to finance lease charges in 2016, (d) a loss of $2.12 million arising upon the re-purchase of the NOK 588 million of bonds at a premium in June 2016 and (e) an increase of $1.45 million in other financial costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had an average of $2,452.88 million of outstanding indebtedness, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.54%, while during the year ended December 31, 2015, we had an average of $2,362.58 million of outstanding indebtedness having an aggregate weighted average interest rate of 3.32%. These
63

weighted average interest rates include interest expense on loans and cash flow hedges and interest expense on Bonds and CCSs.
Loss on Swaps: Loss on swaps increased by 29.91%, or $3.09 million, from $10.33 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, to $13.42 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in loss is mainly attributable to an increase of $22.22 million in loss that was reclassified from equity to the statement of profit or loss related to the interest rate swaps which were terminated in 2016, offset by a decrease of $18.68 million in loss from mark-to-market valuation of our interest rate swaps carried at fair value through profit or loss, which reflected a gain of $18.53 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a loss of $0.15 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and a decrease of $0.47 million in realized loss from interest rate swaps held for trading.
Profit fo r the Year: Profit decreased by 47.74%, or $25.62 million, from $53.67 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, to $28.05 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the aforementioned factors.
Profit/(Loss) Attributable to Owners o f the Group: Profit attributable to owners of the Group decreased by $32.32 million, from a profit of $10.83 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, to a loss of $21.49 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in profit attributable to owners of the Group was a result of the aforementioned factors and was also affected by the increase in profit attributable to the non controlling interest (non-controlling unitholders of GasLog Partners) pursuant to the dropdowns of three vessels to GasLog Partners in July 2015 and one more vessel in November 2016.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we had an average of 18.2 ships operating in our owned fleet having 6,097 operating days and an average of 21.7 ships operating under our technical management (including 17.2 of our owned ships). During the year ended December 31, 2014, we had an average of 12.4 ships operating in our owned fleet having 4,392 operating days and an average of 20.0 ships operating under our technical management (including our 11.9 owned ships).
Revenues: Revenues increased by 26.29%, or $86.40 million, from $328.68 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 to $415.08 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase in revenues by $122.02 million due to the full operation of the Methane Rita Andrea, the Methane Jane Elizabeth, the Methane Lydon Volney, the Methane Shirley Elisabeth, the Methane Heather Sally and the Methane Alison Victoria which were acquired
64

from BG Group in April 2014 and June 2014, the acquisition of the Methane Becki Anne and the Methane Julia Louise which were both acquired from BG Group on March 31, 2015 and the deliveries of the Solaris, the CasLog Saratoga, and the CasLog Salem on June 30, 2014, December 16, 2014 and April 30, 2015, respectively. These acquisitions and deliveries resulted in an increase in operating days. The increase in revenues was partially offset by a decrease of $13.61 million in earnings of a vessel operating in the spot market and a decrease of $6.71 million in revenues from all other vessels, as well as a decrease in revenues of $10.20 million caused mainly by the off-hire days due to the dry-dockings of our vessels in 2015, as opposed to only one in 2014. The daily hire rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $73,081 as compared to $67,650 for the year ended December 31, 2015 affected by the decline in the spot market. There was also a decrease of $5.10 million in revenues from technical management services mainly due to the decrease in the average number of the managed vessels owned by third parties following the acquisition of the eight vessels from BG Group and the termination of a project with another customer.
Vessel Operating and Supervision Costs: Vessel operating and supervision costs increased by 39.33%, or $27.82 million, from $70.73 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $98.55 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase in our fleet in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014, as described above and increased technical maintenance expenses mainly due to repairs undertaken during eight dry-dockings in 2015, as opposed to only one in 2014, partially offset by the decreased average daily operating cost per vessel from $15,649 per day in 2014 to $14,847 per day in 2015, reflecting the favorable movement of the EUR/USD exchange rate affecting mainly crew wages.
Voyage Expenses and Commissions: Voyage and commission expenses increased by 84.63%, or $6.55 million, from $7.74 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $14.29 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly attributable to the increased operating days in the year ended December 31, 2015 affecting the commissions on revenue and increased voyage expenses from the vessels operating in the spot market.
Depreciation: Depreciation increased by 50.83%, or $35.94 million, from $70.70 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $106.64 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in depreciation resulted mainly from the increase in the average number of vessels in our fleet in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014.
General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses increased by 20.88%, or $7.13 million, from $34.15 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $41.28 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is mainly attributable to a $3.44 million increase in legal fees and other professional services including those related to the Partnership's listing requirements, an increase of $0.93 million in personnel related expenses related to the growth of the Group, an increase of $1.02 million in share-based compensation expense, an increase of $0.51 million in board of directors' fees, an increase of $0.40 million in rent and utilities related to the new offices in London, New York and Singapore and an increase of $0.96 million in net foreign exchange losses. The above increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.13 million in various other expenses.
Financial Costs: Financial costs increased by 28.47%, or $20.38 million, from $71.58 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, to $91.96 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase of $26.31 million in interest expense on loans, Bonds and realized loss on cash flow hedges. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we had an average of $2,362.58 million of outstanding indebtedness, including the Bonds, having an aggregate weighted average interest rate of 3.32%, and during the year ended December 31, 2014, we had an average of $1,613.50 million of outstanding indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 3.26%. These weighted average interest rates include interest expense on loans and cash flow hedges and interest expense on Bonds and CCSs.
Loss on Swaps: Loss on swaps decreased by $14.46 million, from $24.79 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, to $10.33 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in loss is mainly attributable to a decrease of $7.72 million in loss from mark-to-market valuation of our interest rate swaps carried at fair value through profit or loss, which reflected a loss of
65

$0.15 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a loss of $7.87 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $1.41 million in realized loss from interest rate swaps held for trading and a decrease of $5.35 million in loss that was reclassified from equity to the statement of profit or loss related to the interest rate swaps for which hedge accounting was discontinued. In 2015, the loss derived from the fact that the LIBOR yield curve, which was used to calculate the present value of the estimated future cash flows, was lower than the agreed fixed interest rates resulting in an increase in derivative liabilities from interest rate swaps held for trading as compared to December 31, 2014.
Profit fo r the Year: Profit increased by 5.71%, or $2.90 million, from $50.77 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, to $53.67 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the aforementioned factors.
Profit Attributable to Owners o f the Group: Profit attributable to owners of the Group decreased by 74.31%, or $31.33 million, from $42.16 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, to $10.83 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in profit attributable to owners of the Group was affected by the increase in profit attributable to the non-controlling interest (non-controlling unitholders of GasLog Partners) which reflects GasLog Partners having been operational for the full financial year in 2015 following its IPO in May 2014.
Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received 94.97% of our revenues from Shell, 4.98% of our revenues from various charterers in the spot/short-term market and 0.05% of our revenues from Egypt LNG. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we received 83.14% of our revenues from BG Group, 11.76% of our revenues from Shell, 4.96% of our revenues from the spot/short-term market and 0.14% of our revenues from Egypt LNG. BG Group was acquired by Shell on February 15, 2016.
Seasonality
Since our owned ships are mainly employed under multi-year, fixed-rate charter arrangements, seasonal trends do not materially impact the revenues earned by our vessels during the year. Seasonality also does not have a significant impact on revenues earned by our management services, as we provide technical ship management and ship construction supervision services under fixed-rate agreements.
Additionally, our business is not subject to seasonal borrowing requirements.
B. Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2016, GasLog has financed its capital requirements with contributions from its pre-IPO shareholders, proceeds from our IPO and the GasLog Partners' IPO, proceeds from the 2014, 2015 and 2016 follow-on equity offerings and the private placements, operating cash flows and long-term financings including bank loans and bond offerings. Our primary liquidity needs are to fund our ship-operating expenses, finance the purchase and construction of our newbuildings, purchase secondhand vessels, service our existing debt and pay dividends. In monitoring our working capital needs, we project our charter hire income and ships' maintenance and running expenses, as well as debt service obligations, and seek to maintain adequate cash reserves in order to address any budget overruns, if any.
We anticipate that our primary sources of funds will be available cash, cash from operations and borrowings under existing and new loan agreements. We may seek to raise additional common or other forms of equity, subject in each case to market conditions. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain future debt and equity financing on terms acceptable to us.
Our funding and treasury activities are intended to balance investment returns in order to maintain appropriate liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in U.S. dollars. We have
66

entered into six CCSs to exchange interest payments and principal on maturity on the same terms as the Bonds and designated the CCSs as hedges of the variability of the USD functional currency equivalent cash flows on the Bonds. Refer to Note 25 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for details on our swap arrangements.
As of December 31, 2016, we had $227.02 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $58.25 million was held in time deposits and $0.84 million was held in ship management client accounts. The funds in the ship management client accounts were held on behalf of customers of GasLog LNG Services in order to cover obligations of third party vessels under management. Moreover, as of December 31, 2016, we had $18.0 million held in time deposits with an initial duration of more than three months but less than a year that have been classified as short-term investments.
As of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of $2.65 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our credit agreements and Bonds, of which $147.45 million was repayable within one year, and a $220.40 million finance lease liability related to the sale and leaseback of the Methane Julia Louise, of which $5.95 million was repayable within one year.
As of December 31, 2016, we had available amounts not yet drawn of $664.03 million under our debt financing agreement signed in October 2015 to partially finance the delivery of eight newbuildings, since the relevant funds shall be drawn upon the deliveries of four of our remaining newbuildings, expected in 2018 and 2019. Additionally, there was an undrawn amount of $88.36 million under the revolving facility of the Legacy Facility Refinancing, which is available to be drawn and repaid at any time until January 2021 and July 2021, respectively.
The total contract price for our five newbuildings on order as of December 31, 2016, is approximately $1.04 billion, of which $91.38 million was paid as of December 31, 2016. The balance is payable under each shipbuilding contract in installments upon the attainment of certain specified milestones, with the largest portion of the purchase price for each ship coming due upon its delivery. We are scheduled to take delivery of the five newbuildings on various dates in 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2016, the total remaining balance of the contract prices for the five newbuildings was $0.95 billion of which $63.66 million is due within 12 months that will be funded with existing undrawn debt, available cash, cash from operations and other financings we may enter into.
As our fleet expands, we will evaluate changes to the quarterly dividend consistent with our cash flow and liquidity position. Our policy is to pay dividends in amounts that will allow us to retain sufficient liquidity to fund our obligations as well as execute our business plan going forward. Our board of directors will determine the timing and amount of all dividend payments, based on various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, restrictions in our credit facilities and the provisions of Bermuda law. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay quarterly dividends. See "Item 3. Key Information--D. Risk Factors" and "Item 8. Financial Information--A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information--Dividend Policy" for a discussion of risks related to our ability to pay dividends.
Working Capital Position
We anticipate that our primary sources of funds will be available cash, cash from operations and borrowings under existing and new loan agreements. We may seek to raise additional common or other forms of equity. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to fund our operations, including our working capital requirements, and to make the required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness during the next 12 months; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain future debt and equity financing on terms acceptable to us.
As of December 31, 2016, our current assets totaled $270.26 million while current liabilities totaled $262.84 million, resulting in a positive working capital position of $7.42 million.

The increase was due to an increase of $57.14 million in revenue collections, a decrease of $50.08 million in payments for cash collaterals, a decrease of $0.13 million in cash paid for interest and a decrease of $0.47 million in realized losses on interest rate swaps held for trading, which were partially offset by an increase of $7.94 million in payments for general and administrative expenses, operating expenses and inventories and an increase of $4.93 million in payments to ship management creditors.

The decrease is mainly attributable to an increase in bank loan repayments of $1,879.87 million, a decrease of $231.52 million in proceeds from equity offerings (the net proceeds from GasLog Partners' public offerings decreased by $120.14 million, while in 2015 we also received $111.38 million net proceeds from GasLog's Preference Shares issuance), payments of $34.11 million for CCS termination/modification and the re-purchase of NOK 588 million of bonds in June 2016, an increase of $18.16 million in payments of loan issuance costs, an increase of $14.68 million in dividend payments and net payments of $4.83 million related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements and entering into new agreements in 2016, which were partially offset by an increase of $1,668.32 million in proceeds from our borrowings, proceeds of $217.00 million from the sale and leaseback of the Methane Julia Louise, an increase of $102.61 million from the release of restricted cash and a decrease of $1.40 million in payments of equity raising costs.

Covenants and Events o f Default
General Our credit facilities impose certain operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions generally limit our subsidiaries' ability to, among
other things: · incur additional indebtedness, create liens or provide guarantees; 71

· provide any form of credit or financial assistance to, or enter into any non-arms' length transactions with us or any of our affiliates;
· sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including our ships;
· engage in merger transactions;
· enter into, terminate or amend any charter;
· amend our shipbuilding contracts;
· change the manager of our ships;
· undergo a change in ownership; or
· acquire assets, make investments or enter into any joint venture arrangements outside of the ordinary course of business.
Our credit facilities (with the exception of the GasLog Partners Credit Facility ) also impose specified financial covenants that apply to us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These financial covenants include the following:
· our net working capital (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) must be not less than $0;
· our total indebtedness divided by our total assets must not exceed 75.0%;
· the ratio of EBITDA over our debt service obligations (including interest and debt repayments) on a trailing 12 months basis must be not less than 110.0%;
· the aggregate amount of all unencumbered cash and cash equivalents must be not less than the higher of 3.0% of our total indebtedness and $50.0 million after the first drawdown;
· we are permitted to pay dividends, provided that we hold unencumbered cash and cash equivalents equal to at least 4.0% of our total indebtedness, subject to no event of default having occurred or occurring as a consequence of the payment of such dividends; and
· our market value adjusted net worth must at all times be not less than $350.0 million.
Our credit facilities also impose certain restrictions relating to us and our other subsidiaries, including restrictions that limit our ability to make any substantial change in the nature of our business or to engage in transactions that would constitute a change of control, as defined in the relevant credit facility, without repaying all of our indebtedness in full, or to allow our largest shareholders to reduce their shareholding in us below specified thresholds.
Certain of our credit facilities also contain vessel employment conditions, pursuant to which we could be required in the event of a charter termination or in certain other circumstances to deposit cash in an account held with the applicable lender until we have obtained a new time charter on terms acceptable to such lender, or under certain of our credit facilities repay the outstanding loan amount.
Our credit facilities contain customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal or interest, breach of covenants or material inaccuracy of representations, default under other material indebtedness and bankruptcy. In addition, our credit facilities contain covenants requiring us and certain of our subsidiaries to maintain the aggregate of (i) the market value, on a charter exclusive basis, of the mortgaged vessel or vessels and (ii) the market value of any additional security provided to the lenders, not less than 120.0% (in the case of the October 2015 Facility, 115.0% for the first two years after each drawdown and 120.0% at any time thereafter and in the case of the Five Vessel Refinancing, 115.0% until the maturity of the junior tranche and 120.0% at any time thereafter) of the then outstanding amount under the applicable facility. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are not able to obtain covenant waivers or modifications, our lenders could require us to make prepayments or provide additional collateral sufficient to bring us into compliance with such covenants, and if we fail to do so our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness.
Compliance with the financial covenants is required on a semi-annual basis and we were in compliance with the respective financial covenants as of December 31, 2016.
72

GasLog Partners Credit Facility and the Five Vessel Refinancing
The GasLog Partners Credit Facility and the Five Vessel Refinancing are subject to specified financial covenants that apply to us on GasLog Partners' consolidated basis. These financial covenants include the following:
· the aggregate amount of all unencumbered cash and cash equivalents must be not less than the higher of 3.0% of total indebtedness or $15.0 million;
· total indebtedness divided by total assets must be less than 60.0%;
· the ratio of EBITDA over debt service obligations (including interest and debt repayments) on a trailing 12 months basis must be not less than 110.0%; and

The GasLog Partners Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal or interest, breach of covenants or material inaccuracy of representations, default under other material indebtedness and bankruptcy as well as an event of default in the event of the cancellation, rescission, frustration or withdrawal of a charter agreement prior to its scheduled expiration. In addition, the GasLog Partners Credit Facility contains covenants requiring us and certain of our subsidiaries to maintain the aggregate of (i) the market value, on a charter exclusive basis, of the mortgaged vessel or vessels and (ii) the market value of any additional security provided to the lenders, not less than 120.0% of the then outstanding amount under the applicable facility. If GasLog Partners fails to comply with these covenants and is not able to obtain covenant waivers or modifications, its lenders could require it to make prepayments or provide additional collateral sufficient to bring it into compliance with such covenants, and if it fails to do so its lenders could accelerate our indebtedness.
The GasLog Partners Credit Facility and the Five Vessel Refinancing also impose certain restrictions relating to the Partnership, including restrictions that limit its ability to make any substantial change in the nature of its business or to the corporate structure without approval from the lenders.
Compliance with the financial covenants is required on a semi-annual basis. GasLog Partners was in compliance with the respective financial covenants as of December 31, 2016.
Senior Unsecured Notes
On June 27, 2013, we issued a NOK 500 million bond under the 2018 Bond Agreement (or $83.21 million based on the exchange rate on June 27, 2013) that will mature on June 27, 2018. On May 2, 2014, we closed a follow-on issue of NOK 500.0 million bond under the 2018 Bond Agreement (or $83.61 million based on the exchange rate on closing date) at a premium of $4.18 million (based on the exchange rate on closing date). On June 27, 2016, we repurchased and cancelled NOK 588.0 million (or $70.68 million) of the outstanding bonds under the 2018 Bond Agreement at a price of 103% of par value. The total outstanding balance under the 2018 Bond Agreement, after the follow-on issue and the partial repurchase, amounts to NOK 412.0 million.
The bonds under the 2018 Bond Agreement bear interest at NIBOR plus margin. Interest payments shall be made in arrears on a quarterly basis. The carrying amount under the 2018 Bond Agreement, net of unamortized financing costs and premium, as of December 31, 2016 was $48.19 million. We may redeem the aforementioned bonds in whole or in part as follows: (a) with settlement date at any time from June 27, 2016 to but not including June 27, 2017 at 105.0% of par plus accrued interests on redeemed amount, (b) with settlement date at any time from June 27, 2017 to but not including December 27, 2017 at 103.0% of par plus accrued interests on redeemed amount, and (c) with settlement date at any time from December 27, 2017 to but not including the maturity date at 101.75% of par plus accrued interests on redeemed amount.
Under the 2018 Bond Agreement we are required to comply with the financial covenants listed below:
· total indebtedness divided by total assets must not exceed 75.0%;
73

· the ratio of EBITDA over debt service obligations (including interest and debt repayments) on a trailing 12 months basis must be not less than 110.0% ;
· the aggregate amount of all unencumbered cash and cash equivalents must exceed the higher of 3.0% of total indebtedness and $20.0 million after the first drawdown; and
· the Group's market value adjusted net worth must at all times be not less than $350.0 million.
In addition, we are not permitted to (i) declare or make any dividend payment or distribution, whether in cash or in kind, (ii) repurchase any of our shares or undertake other similar transactions (including, but not limited to, total return swaps related to our shares), or (iii) grant any loans or make other distributions or transactions constituting a transfer of value to our shareholders (items (i), (ii) and (iii) collectively referred to as the "Distributions") that in aggregate exceed during any calendar year 50.0% of our consolidated net profit after taxes based on the audited annual accounts for the previous financial year (any unutilized portion of the permitted dividend pursuant to the above may not be carried forward). In the amendment to the 2018 Bond Agreement signed in November 2014, certain covenants were revised in order to reflect our growth and the anticipated growth of GasLog Partners. Under the amended agreement, (a) notwithstanding the restriction on Distributions described above, we are permitted to make Distributions up to an aggregate maximum per share, for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 of $1.10/share, $1.20/share and $1.30/share, respectively, provided that total indebtedness divided by total assets (giving pro forma effect for the Distribution) does not exceed 67.5% immediately after the Distribution is made, the ratio of EBITDA over debt service obligations on a trailing 12 months basis ending the quarter immediately prior to that in which the Distribution is made is not less than 115.0% and no event of default would result from such Distribution, (b) the amount of debt or committed debt availability that we provide to GasLog Partners cannot exceed $75.0 million and (c) we agreed to pay a one time fee of 1.0% of the face value of the bonds.
On June 27, 2016, GasLog completed the issuance of NOK 750 million of new senior unsecured bonds under the 2021 Bond Agreement (equivalent to $90.2 million) in the Norwegian bond market. The bonds will mature in May 2021 and bear interest at NIBOR plus margin. Interest payments shall be made in arrears on a quarterly basis. The carrying amount of the bonds under the 2021 Bond Agreement, net of unamortized financing costs, as of December 31, 2016 was $85.35 million. We may redeem the aforementioned bonds in whole or in part as follows: (a) with settlement date at any time from June 27, 2019 to but not including June 27, 2020 at 104.0% of par plus accrued interests on redeemed amount, (b) with settlement date at any time from June 27, 2020 to but not including December 27, 2020 at 102.5% of par plus accrued interests on redeemed amount, and (c) with settlement date at any time from December 27, 2020 to but not including the maturity date at 101.0% of par plus accrued interests on redeemed amount.
Under the 2021 Bond Agreement we are required to comply with the financial covenants listed below:
· net working capital (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) must not be less than $0;
· total indebtedness divided by total assets must not exceed 75.0%;
· the ratio of EBITDA over debt service obligations as defined in the 2021 Bond Agreement (including interest and debt repayments) on a trailing 12 months basis must be not less than 110.0%;
· the aggregate amount of all unencumbered cash and cash equivalents must not be less than the higher of 3.0% of total indebtedness and $50.0 million after the first drawdown; and
· the Group's market value adjusted net worth must at all times be not less than $350.0 million.
In addition, we are not permitted to (i) declare or make any dividend payment or distribution, whether in cash or in kind, (ii) re-purchase any of the Group's shares or undertake other similar transactions (including, but not limited to, total return swaps related to the Group's shares), or (iii) grant any loans or make other distributions or transactions constituting a transfer of value to the Group's shareholders (items (i), (ii) and (iii) collectively referred to as the "Distributions") that in aggregate exceed during any calendar year, 50% of the Group's consolidated net profit after taxes
74

based on the audited annual accounts for the previous financial year (any unutilized portion of the permitted Distributions pursuant to the above may not be carried forward). For the purposes of the above, the consolidated net profit after taxes of the Group shall not include any profits related to the sale of assets (and consequently any such profits related to such profits shall not form the basis for Distributions). Under the 2021 Bond Agreement, GasLog is permitted to make Distributions up to a maximum amount per share per annum for the years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 of $1.00/share, $1.10/share, $1.10/share, $1.20/share, $1.20/share and $1.20/share, respectively, provided that GasLog can demonstrate by delivering a compliance certificate to the bond trustee that no event of default is continuing or would result from such Distributions.
Compliance with our Bonds' covenants is required at all times and we were in compliance with the respective financial covenants as of December 31, 2016.

Capital Expenditures
We make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with the expansion and operation of our owned fleet. In 2010 we took delivery of two LNG carriers, in 2013 we took delivery of six LNG carriers and acquired a secondhand vessel, in 2014 we took delivery of two LNG carriers and acquired six secondhand vessels, in 2015 we acquired two secondhand vessels and took delivery of one LNG carrier and in 2016 we took delivery of four LNG carriers. During the years ended December 31 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we funded $0.76 billion, $0.73 billion, $1.36 billion and $1.04 billion, respectively, of construction and delivery costs, including installment payments on newbuildings, with funds borrowed under credit facilities and the Bonds, capital contributions from our pre-IPO shareholders, proceeds from our IPO and the GasLog Partners' IPO and proceeds from follow-on equity offerings and private placements.
As of December 31, 2016, our commitments for capital expenditures related to the five contracted LNG carriers on order. The outstanding commitment for our five newbuildings on order as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $946.93 million. Amounts are payable under each shipbuilding contract in installments upon the attainment of certain specified milestones in each ship's construction, with the largest portion of the purchase price for each ship coming due upon its delivery.
We intend to fund these commitments with borrowings under the October 2015 Facility which has an aggregate undrawn amount of $664.03 million, available cash and cash from operations.
To the extent that we are unable to draw down the amounts committed under our credit facilities, we will need to find alternative financing. If we are unable to find alternative financing, we will not be capable of funding all of our commitments for capital expenditures relating to our contracted newbuildings and secondhand vessels, which could adversely impact our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements. GasLog's management evaluates whether estimates should be made on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods management considers reasonable in the particular circumstances. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets or liabilities in the future. Critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. For a description of all our
75

principal accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.
Classification o f the Non-Controlling Interests
The non-controlling interests in the Partnership comprise the portion of the Partnership's common units that are not directly or indirectly held by GasLog (24,410,000 units as of December 31, 2016). Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership is required to distribute 100.0% of available cash (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) with respect to each quarter within 45 days of the end of the quarter to the partners. Available cash can be summarized as cash and cash equivalents less an amount equal to cash reserves established by the Partnership's board of directors to (i) provide for the proper conduct of the business of the Partnership (including reserves for future capital expenditures and for anticipated future credit needs of the Partnership) subsequent to such quarter, (ii) comply with applicable law or any loan agreement, security agreement, mortgage, debt instrument or other agreement or obligation to which any Partnership group member is a party or by which it is bound or its assets are subject and/or (iii) provide funds for certain distributions relating to future periods.
In reaching a judgment as to whether the non-controlling interests in the Partnership should be classified as liabilities or equity interests, management has considered the wide discretion of the Partnership's board of directors to determine whether any portion of the amount of cash available to the Partnership constitutes available cash and that it is possible that there could be no available cash. In the event that there is no available cash, as determined by the Partnership's board of directors, the Partnership does not have a contractual obligation to make a distribution. Accordingly, management has concluded that the non-controlling interests do not represent a contractual obligation on the Partnership to deliver cash and therefore should be classified as equity within the financial statements.
Vessel Lives and Residual Value
Vessels are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the vessel carrying amount relate to the estimation of the useful life of a LNG vessel of 35 years and the residual value. An increase in the estimated useful life of a vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and an increase in the estimated useful life of a vessel would also extend the annual depreciation charge into later periods. A decrease in the useful life of a vessel or its residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge.
Management estimated residual value of its vessels to be equal to the product of its LWT and an estimated scrap rate per LWT. Effective December 31, 2016, following management's annual reassessment, the estimated scrap rate per LWT was decreased. This change in estimate is expected to increase the future annual depreciation expense by $0.48 million. The estimated residual value of our ships may not represent the fair market value at any one time partly because market prices of scrap values tend to fluctuate. We might revise our estimate of the residual values of our ships in the future in response to changing market conditions.
If regulations place significant limitations on the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, the vessel's useful life will be adjusted to end at the date such regulations become effective.
Vessel Cost
When determining vessel cost, we recognize the installment payments paid to the shipyard or the acquisition price paid to the seller for secondhand vessels along with any directly attributable costs of bringing the vessels to their working condition. Directly attributable costs incurred during the vessel construction periods consist of commissions, on-site supervision costs, costs for sea trials, certain critical initial spare parts and equipment, costs directly incurred for negotiating the construction contracts, initial lubricants and other vessel delivery expenses. Any vendor discounts are deducted from the vessel cost. Subsequent expenditures for conversions and major improvements are also capitalized when the recognition criteria are met.
76

The vessel cost component is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of each ship, based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value. We estimate the useful lives of our ships to be 35 years from the date of delivery from the shipyard, which we believe is within industry standards and represents the most reasonable useful life for each of our ships.
We must periodically dry-dock each of our ships for inspection, repairs and any modifications. At the time of delivery of a ship from the shipyard, we estimate the dry-docking component of the cost of the ship, representing estimated costs to be incurred during the first dry-docking at the dry-dock yard for a special survey and parts and supplies used in making required major repairs that meet the recognition criteria, based on our historical experience with similar types of ships. For subsequent dry-dockings actual costs are capitalized when incurred. Costs that will be capitalized as part of the future dry-dockings will include a variety of costs incurred directly attributable to the dry-docking and costs incurred to meet classification and regulatory requirements, as well as expenses related to the dock preparation and port expenses at the dry-dock shipyard, general shipyard expenses, expenses related to hull, external surfaces and decks, expenses related to machinery and engines of the vessel, as well as expenses related to the testing and correction of findings related to safety equipment on board. Dry-docking costs do not include vessel operating expenses such as replacement parts, crew expenses, provisions, lubricants consumption, insurance, management fees or management costs during the dry-docking period. Expenses related to regular maintenance and repairs of our vessels are expensed as incurred, even if such maintenance and repair occurs during the same time period as our dry-docking.
Ordinary maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred.
We recognize dry-docking costs as a separate component of the vessel's carrying amounts and amortize the dry-docking cost on a straight-line basis over the estimated period until the next dry-docking. If the vessel is disposed of before the next dry-docking, the remaining balance of the drydock component is written-off and forms part of the gain or loss recognized upon disposal of vessels in the period of disposal. We expect that vessels will be required to be dry-docked in approximately 60 months after their delivery from the shipyard, and thereafter every 60 months will be required to undergo special or intermediate surveys and dry-docked for major repairs and maintenance that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating. We amortize the estimated dry-docking expenses for the first special survey over five years, in case of new vessels, and until the next drydocking for secondhand vessels unless we intend to dry-dock the vessels earlier as circumstances arise.
Impairment o f Vessels
We evaluate the carrying amounts of our vessels to determine whether there is any indication that our vessels have suffered an impairment loss by considering both internal and external sources of information. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of vessels is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. The projection of cash flows related to vessels is complex and requires management to make various estimates including future freight rates, earnings from the vessels and discount rates. All of these items have been historically volatile. In assessing the fair value less cost to sell of the vessel, we obtain vessel valuations from independent and internationally recognized ship brokers on an annual basis or when there is an indication that an asset or assets may be impaired. If an indication of impairment is identified, the need for recognizing an impairment loss is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the vessels to the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use.
Our estimates of basic market value assume that the vessels are all in seaworthy condition without a need for repair and if inspected would be certified in class without notations of any kind. Our estimates are based on approximate market values for the vessels that have been received from
77

shipbrokers, which are also commonly used and accepted by our lenders for determining compliance with the relevant covenants in our credit facilities. Vessel values can be highly volatile, so that the estimates may not be indicative of the current or future basic market value of our vessels or prices that could be achieved if we were to sell them.
The table below sets forth in U.S. dollars (i) the historical acquisition cost of our vessels and (ii) the carrying value of each of our vessels as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016.

111 Our vessels and the vessel held under finance lease are stated at carrying values (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report). For the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, no impairment was recorded. However, the value in use o f the ten vessels described below (including the Methane Julia Louise, which is held under finance lease) was higher than the carrying amount o f these vessels and consequently, no impairment loss was recognized.
The vessel was built in 2010.
131 The vessels were built in 2006.
141 The vessels were built in 2007.
151 Indicates vessels for which we believe, as o f December 31, 2016, the charter-free market value is lower than the vessel's carrying value. We believe that the aggregate carrying value o f these vessels exceeds their aggregate basic charter-free market value by $239.77 million, as o f December 31, 2016. However, as described below, the value in use for each o f the ten vessels was higher than the carrying amount o f these vessels and consequently, no impairment loss was recognized.
Except where indicated, the market value of each vessel individually, and all vessels in the aggregate, exceeds the carrying value of that vessel, and all vessels in the aggregate, as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016.
As of December 31, 2016, for the ten vessels with carrying amounts higher than the estimated charter-free market value we concluded that events and circumstances triggered the existence of
78

potential impairment of these vessels. As a result, the Group performed the impairment assessment of the Group's vessels by comparing the discounted projected net operating cash flows for these vessels to their carrying value. The significant factors and assumptions the Group used in its discounted projected net operating cash flow analysis included, among others, operating revenues, off-hire revenues, dry-docking costs, operating expenses, management fees estimates and the discount rate. Revenue assumptions were based on contracted time charter rates up to the end of life of the current contract of each vessel as well as the estimated average time charter rates for the remaining life of the vessel after the completion of its current contract. The estimated daily time charter rates used for non-contracted revenue days are based on a combination of (i) recent charter market rates, (ii) conditions existing in the LNG market as of December 31, 2016, (iii) historical average time charter rates, based on publications by independent third party maritime research services and (iv) estimated future time charter rates, based on publications by independent third party maritime research services that provide such forecasts. Recognizing that the LNG industry is cyclical and subject to significant volatility based on factors beyond our control, management believes the use of revenue estimates, based on the combination of factors (i) to (iv) above, to be reasonable as of the reporting date. In addition, the Group used an annual operating expenses escalation factor and estimates of scheduled and unscheduled offhire revenues based on historical experience. All estimates used and assumptions made were in accordance with the Group's internal budgets and historical experience of the shipping industry. The value in use for the ten vessels calculated as per above was higher than the carrying amount of these vessels, and consequently, no impairment loss was recognized.

In connection with the impairment testing of our vessels as of December 31, 2016, for the ten vessels with carrying amounts higher than the estimated charter-free market value, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the most sensitive and/or subjective assumption that has the potential to affect the outcome of the impairment exercise, the projected charter hire rate used to forecast future cash flows for non-contracted days. The following table summarizes the average results of the sensitivity analysis that we performed.

111 The average charter rate used in our impairment testing is the average charter rate based on which we estimated the revenues for the remaining useful life o f the respective vessels.
The average break-even charter hire rate is the average charter rate that if used in the discounted projected net operating cash flows o f the impairment testing, will result in discounted total cash flows being equal to the carrying value o f the vessels.

Measurement o f Share-based Compensation
Share-based compensation to executives and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments on the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of share-based transactions are set out in Note 21 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based compensation is expensed over the vesting period, based on our estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, we revise our estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the sharebased compensation reserve.
79

Impairment o f Goodwill
We review goodwill for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to the cash-generating unit representing our management company, GasLog LNG Services, which was acquired by us in 2005.
Determining whether goodwill has been impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, of the cash-generating unit(s) to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit(s) and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Details of the impairment analysis are set out in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. No impairment loss was recognized for any of the periods presented.
Fair Value o f Derivative Financial Instruments
Our risk management policies permit the use of derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in the consolidated statements of profit or loss.
A substantial majority of our derivative instruments activity relates to the use of interest rate swaps. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit worthiness of both us and the swap counterparties. The estimated amount is the present value of estimated future cash flows, being equal to the difference between the benchmark interest rate and the fixed rate in the interest rate swap agreement, multiplied by the notional principal amount of the interest rate swap agreement at each interest reset date.
The fair value of our interest rate and currency swap agreements at the end of each period are most significantly affected by the interest rate implied by market-observable data such as LIBOR yield curve, and forward foreign exchange rates. While the fair value of our interest and currency swap agreements are typically more sensitive to changes in short-term rates, significant changes in the long-term benchmark interest and foreign exchange rates also materially impact our interest and currency swap agreements.
The fair value of our interest and currency swap agreements are also affected by changes in our specific credit risk and counterparties' risk included in the discount factor. The estimate of the Group's credit risk is based on the credit rating of other companies in the LNG industry where publicly available, the rating of the global transportation industry where the shipping industry is included and the feedback that the Group receives from its lenders as part of the margin setting for the new loan agreements. The counterparties' credit risk is estimated either by using the credit default swap rates obtained from public information or, if not available, by using the credit rating of the counterparties.
The LIBOR yield curve and our specific credit risk are expected to vary over the life of the interest rate swap agreements. The larger the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements outstanding and the longer the remaining duration of the interest rate swap agreements, the larger the impact of any variability in these factors will be on the fair value of our interest rate swaps. We economically hedge the interest rate exposure on a significant amount of our long-term debt and for long durations. As such, we have historically experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, material variations in the period-to-period fair value of our derivative instruments.
Although we measure the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing the inputs and assumptions described above, if we were to terminate the agreements at the reporting date, the amount we would pay or receive to terminate the derivative instruments may differ from our estimate of fair value. If the estimated fair value differs from the actual termination amount, an adjustment to the carrying amount of the applicable derivative asset or liability would be recognized in profit or loss for the current period. Such adjustments could be material. See Note 25 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for the effects on the change in fair value of our derivative instruments on our consolidated statements of profit or loss.

D. Trend Information
LNG Supply
The global seaborne trade of LNG cargoes was over 265 mtpa in 2016, and is projected to rise to approximately 300 mtpa in 2017. This growth is driven mainly by Australian projects, with shipments commencing from Gorgon Trains 2 and 3(10 mtpa), Wheatstone LNG Train 1 (4.5 mtpa) and Icthys Train 1 (4.2 mtpa) all scheduled to start up in the next 12 months. Looking beyond 2017, based on the public announcements of LNG producers, new LNG production volumes should become available in the 2018-2020 timeframe from projects in Australia, Malaysia, Cameroon and the United States. Of these countries, the United States is by far the most significant contributor to new supply, with more than 50 mtpa anticipated by the end of 2020.
The U.S. projects comprise the second major wave of new LNG supply, following the continuing ramp-up in Australia. Sabine Pass, one of five U.S. projects under construction, began exporting from Trains 1 and 2 in 2016; when construction on the remaining trains is complete, Sabine Pass will have a total export capacity of 22.5 mtpa. Other U.S. projects scheduled to begin exports by the end of 2020 include Freeport (13.2 mtpa), Corpus Christi (9 mtpa), Cameron LNG (12 mtpa), Cove Point (5.3 mtpa) and Elba Island (2.5 mtpa). The majority of U.S. volumes have already been contracted with most expected to go into the Asian and European markets. This development will be positive for tonne mile demand as the U.S. Gulf Coast to Asia voyage is approximately 9,000 nautical miles through the Panama Canal, which opened to LNG shipping in 2016. The same voyage around Cape Horn is approximately 13,000 nautical miles. From the U.S. Gulf Coast to northwest Europe, the distance is approximately 5,000 nautical miles. In recent years, the average global LNG voyage was approximately 4,000 nautical miles, and therefore any voyage in excess of this distance will increase the global average distance and thus the demand for LNG carriers.
LNG Demand
In recent years, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, Poland, Colombia, Malta, Jamaica and Jordan all imported their first LNG cargoes. This increase in the number of importing nations has been encouraged by low gas prices and attractive economics for FSRUs. These are either custom-built vessels or LNG Carriers that have been converted to operate as FSRUs, and offer cheaper and quicker access to LNG markets. FSRUs remain a growing sector of the LNG trade and they increase not only the number of potential customers but also the range of LNG trade routes.
LNG Chartering Activity
The significant fall in oil prices since 2014 has led to substantial declines in the price of LNG and a lack of pricing differential between the Eastern and Western hemispheres. These factors, among others, led in turn to a significant shortening of the average duration of spot charters fixed throughout 2015 and into 2016, as well as a significant decline in average rates for new spot and shorter-term LNG charters commencing promptly. The latter half of 2016 saw this trend reversing, with charterers taking vessels for longer periods and/or at higher rates; however, the turnaround is slow. In addition, some production companies have announced delays or cancellations of certain previously announced (but early stage) LNG projects, which, unless offset by new projects coming on stream, could adversely affect demand for LNG charters over the next few years, while the amount of tonnage available for charter is expected to increase.
81

Approximately 58% more fixtures of LNG vessels were concluded in 2016, compared with 2015. This significant increase in chartering activity is a positive sign for the developing LNG shipping market, and reflects among other trends the increasing activity of trading houses. Our ability to participate in any future market growth will depend on our ability to access the equity and debt markets.

Global LNG Fleet
As of December 31, 2016, the global fleet of dedicated LNG carriers stood at 480 ships. For 2016, approximately 40 LNG carriers were scheduled for delivery, and only five orders were placed. This low level of ordering is commensurate with the poor market conditions in 2015 and 2016.
We believe that the growing global demand for natural gas and the evolution of the LNG market, including less efficient trading with cargoes spending more time on the water, should support the existing order backlog for vessels and should also drive a need for more LNG carriers in the future. In addition, LNG project developers are typically large multinational oil and gas companies that have high standards for safety and reliability and a preference for modern LNG carriers with fuel-efficient ship design and propulsion, which should support our ability to obtain new charters over new or less-experienced operators. However, various factors, including changes in prices and demand for LNG can materially affect the competitive dynamics that currently exist.
The statements in this "Trend Information" section are forward-looking statements based on management's current expectations and certain material assumptions and, accordingly, involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance and outcomes to differ materially from those expressed herein. See "Item 3. Key Information--D. Risk Factors" of this annual report.

Board Leadership Structure
Our board leadership structure consists of our Chairman, the vice chairman/ senior independent director and the chairmen of our board committees. Our operational management is headed by our CEO. Mr. Wogan, as CEO, is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Company, which includes decisions relating to the Company's general management and control of its affairs and business and works with our board in developing our business strategy. The board of directors does not have a policy mandating that the roles of CEO and Chairman be held by separate individuals, but believes that at this time the separation of such roles is appropriate and beneficial to shareholders.
Dennis M. Houston, who serves as our senior independent director, acts as a liaison to facilitate communication between independent directors and our Chairman to ensure that the board functions in an effective manner.
B. Compensation of Directors and Senior Management
Our non-executive directors receive:
· an annual fee of $120,000;
· an additional annual fee of $20,000 to the senior independent director;
· additional annual fees of $100,000 to the Chairman of the board, $50,000 to the chairman of the audit and risk committee and $20,000 to the chairmen of the compensation committee, corporate governance and nominating committee and HSSE committee;
· additional annual fees of $25,000 to each member of the audit and risk committee and $10,000 to each member of the compensation committee, corporate governance and nominating committee and HSSE committee (in each case other than the chairmen of such committees); and
· additional annual fees of $20,000 to each board member who also serves as a board member of GasLog Partners (in lieu of direct compensation from GasLog Partners for such service).
The aggregate annual fees paid to non-executive directors in 2016 was $1.5 million.
The board of directors may determine that a portion of the above fees will be paid in shares rather than cash.
In addition, our directors receive reimbursement for their out-of-pocket expenses including travel costs. We do not have any service contracts with our directors that provide for benefits upon termination of their services.
86

For 2016, our executive officers were Paul Wogan, Simon Crowe and Graham Westgarth. Compensation for our executive officers in 2016 consisted of base salary and employee benefits that are generally provided to employees, including eligibility to receive a cash incentive bonus pursuant to our Management Incentive Plan, or "MIP". The MIP provides all shore-based personnel (which includes our executive officers) an opportunity to earn a cash incentive payment based on a target percentage of the participant's annual base salary, subject to the achievement of preestablished individual and Company performance objectives, as well as a factor based on Company discretion. Each participant's target percentage of annual base salary and the weightings assigned to the individual and Company performance objectives and the Company discretionary component are dependent on the participant's organization (band) level. No amounts will be paid under the MIP to any participant who fails to achieve 50.0% of his or her target individual performance objectives. In 2016, the Company performance objectives were measured against three equally-weighted key business indicators: Free Cash Flow per Share, Absolute Return on Invested Capital and three-year rolling average Relative Total Shareholder Return. In addition, Company performance is evaluated against a safety factor based on Personal Safety, Significant Incidents and Leading Indicators, in which a failure to meet the safety target may result in a reduction of the Company performance payout factor. Under the individual and Company performance objectives, stretch goals are established, which, if met, can result in a payout of up to 120.0% of the individual's target payout. The Company discretionary component may not increase an individual's payment to more than 200.0% of his or her target payout. The amounts paid to our executive officers in 2016 pursuant to the MIP were determined based on the following weightings: individual performance (30.0%), Company performance (50.0%) and Company discretion (20.0%).
The aggregate amount of cash compensation, including cash incentive compensation, paid to our executive officers for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2.69 million.
In addition, each of our executive officers was eligible to receive equity-based compensation awards in accordance with the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, or the "Plan". On April 1, 2016, we granted our executive officers an aggregate of 232,871 stock options and 58,377 restricted stock units under the Plan, with an aggregate fair value as of the grant date of $1.08 million. The stock options have an exercise price per share of $9.28 and will vest in three equal annual installments, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to the recipient's continued service. The restricted stock units vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to the recipient's continued service. The stock options and the restricted stock units may be settled in cash or common shares, or a combination thereof, at our discretion.
We generally determine during the February meeting of the board of the directors each year which individuals, if any, will be eligible to receive equity-based compensation awards under the Plan for such year and the amount of awards each participant will be eligible to receive. In addition, we intend to grant such awards on April 1 of such year (or, should April 1 of such year fall on a weekend or bank holiday, on the first business day thereafter).
We did not set aside or accrue any amounts in the year ended December 31, 2016 to provide pension, retirement or similar benefits to our directors or executive officers.
C. Board Practices
Our board of directors consists of ten members. The board of directors may change the number of directors to not less than three, nor more than fifteen. Each director shall be elected to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until his successor is elected or appointed, except in the event of removal, death, disability, disqualification or resignation. A vacancy on the board created by removal, death, disability, disqualification or resignation of a director, or as a result of an increase in the size of the board, may be filled by the shareholders or by the board of directors.
We are a "foreign private issuer" under the securities laws of the United States and the rules of the NYSE. Under the securities laws of the United States, "foreign private issuers" are subject to different disclosure requirements than U.S. domiciled registrants, as well as different financial reporting requirements. Under the NYSE rules, a "foreign private issuer" is subject to less stringent corporate governance requirements. Subject to certain exceptions, the rules of the NYSE permit a
87

"foreign private issuer" to follow its home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of the NYSE, including (i) the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (ii) the requirement that the nominating committee be composed entirely of independent directors and have a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities, (iii) the requirement that the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors and have a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities and (iv) the requirement of an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees. Six of our ten directors qualify as independent. We have one or more non-independent directors serving as committee members on our compensation committee and our corporate governance and nominating committee. As a result, non-independent directors may, among other things, participate in fixing the compensation of our management, making share and option awards and resolving governance issues regarding our Company. Accordingly, in the future you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.
Committees of the Board of Directors
Audit and Risk Committee
Our audit and risk committee consists of Messrs. Conner, Friedrich, Elouston and Kintzer with Mr. Kintzer serving as the committee chairman. Our board of directors has affirmatively determined that each of these individuals meets the definition of "independent director" for purposes of serving on an audit committee under applicable SEC and NYSE rules. Mr. Conner and Mr. Kintzer each qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert". The audit and risk committee is responsible for:

Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee Our corporate governance and nominating committee consists of Messrs. Blythe, Houston, Livanos and Papadimitriou, with Mr. Houston serving
as the committee chairman. The corporate governance and nominating committee is responsible for: · identifying and recommending candidates, consistent with criteria approved by the full board of directors, for nomination to be elected by shareholders at annual meetings and for approval of the board of directors to fill board vacancies as and when they arise between annual meetings, as well as putting in place short- and long-term succession plans for senior management and the CEO direct reports; · developing and recommending to the full board of directors' corporate governance guidelines applicable to the Company and keeping such guidelines under review; · overseeing self-evaluations conducted by the board of directors and its committees and overseeing evaluations of senior management; and · handling such other matters that are specifically delegated to the corporate governance and nominating committee by the board of directors from time to time.
Health, Safety, Security and Environmental Committee Our health, safety, security and environmental, or "HSSE", committee consists of Messrs. Friedrich, Livanos and Wogan, with Mr. Friedrich
serving as the committee chairman. The HSSE committee is responsible for: · overseeing the Company's top-level HSSE policies (including those relating to operational risks); · reviewing the Company's HSSE policies (including those relating to operational risks) on an annual basis and recommending changes to such policies to the Company's management team; · based on reports from management, evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's systems to achieve the established HSSE policies; · receiving reports from management relating to any serious accidents or fatalities and reviewing recommended actions to be taken by management in connection therewith; · overseeing whether the Company's HSSE policies take appropriate account of internal and external developments and expectations; · evaluating and overseeing the quality of reporting systems required by third parties on HSSE related matters; and 89

Corporate Governance The board of directors and our Company's management engage in an ongoing review of our corporate governance practices in order to oversee
our compliance with the applicable corporate governance rules of the NYSE and the SEC. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for all directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company. This document and other important information on our governance are posted on our website and may be viewed at http://www. easloeltd.com.
The information contained on or connected to our website is not a part of this annual report. We will also provide a paper copy of any of these documents upon the written request of a shareholder at no cost. Shareholders may direct their requests to the attention of our General Counsel, c/o GasLog Monaco S.A.M., Gildo Pastor Center, 7 Rue du Gabian, MC 98000, Monaco.
D. Employees As of December 31, 2016, we had 173 full-time employees and contractors, based in our offices in Greece, Monaco, London, New York,
Singapore or the newbuildings site in South Korea. In addition to our shore-based employees and contractors, we had approximately 1,360 seafaring staff serving on our owned and managed ships. These seafarers are retained through crewing agencies based in Ukraine, the Philippines and Spain or, in the case of Greek seafarers, through direct hire. As we take delivery of our newbuildings, we expect to retain a significant number of additional seafarers qualified to man and operate our new ships, as well as additional shore-based personnel. We intend to focus our seafaring hiring efforts in the Ukrainian, Philippine and Spanish markets, where we have crewing agency agreements in place, and in Greece.
LNG marine transportation is a specialized area requiring technically skilled officers and personnel with specialized training. We regard attracting and retaining motivated, well-qualified seagoing and shore-based personnel as a top priority, and we offer our people competitive compensation packages. In addition, we provide intensive onboard training for our officers and crew to instill a culture of the highest operational and safety standards. As a result, we have historically enjoyed high retention rates. In 2016, our retention rate was 95% for senior seagoing officers, 98% for other officers and 99% for shore staff.
Although we have historically experienced high employee retention rates, the demand for technically skilled officers and crews to serve on LNG carriers has been increasing as the global fleet of LNG carriers continues to grow. This increased demand has and may continue to put
90

inflationary cost pressure on ensuring qualified and well trained crew are available to us. However, we expect that the impact of cost increases would be mitigated to some extent by certain provisions in our time charters, including automatic periodic adjustment provisions and cost review provisions.

E. Share Ownership

Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions--A. Major Shareholders" below. For information regarding arrangements for involving the employees in the capital of the Company, see "Item 6.

interests. Mr. Livanos's ownership interest changed in connection with the purchase by Blenheim Holdings o f certain outstanding manager shares in January 2012, and a transfer by Blenheim Holdings o f 657,090 shares to one o f its minority shareholders in March 2014 in exchange for such shareholder's interest in Blenheim Holdings. By virtue o f common shares held indirectly through its wholly owned subsidiary, Olympic LNG Investments Ltd. A portion o f the shares were acquired from the Company in a private placement in January 2014. The Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation is the sole beneficiary o f the assets and income o f the Onassis Foundation, and as a result may be deemed to have indirect beneficial ownership o f the shares.
131 Based on information contained in the Schedule 13G filed with the SEC on February 14, 2017, Fairview Capital Investment Management, LLC has shared voting and dispositive power over 5,230,953 common shares with Fairview Capital, Andrew F. Mathieson, Scott W. Clark, and Darlington Partners L.P.
141 Based on information contained in the Schedule 13G filed with the SEC on February 14, 2017. * Less than 1.0%.
In March 2012, we completed a registered public offering of our common shares and our common shares began trading on the NYSE. Our major shareholders have the same voting rights as our other shareholders. As of February 17, 2017, we had approximately 11,674 shareholders.
Holders of our Preference Shares generally have no voting rights except (i) in respect of amendments to the Memorandum of Association which would adversely vary the rights of the Preference Shares or, (ii) in the event that the Company proposes to issue any parity shares if the cumulative dividends payable on issued and outstanding Preference Shares are in arrears or any senior shares or (iii) in the event of a proposed amalgamation or merger of the Company. However, if and whenever dividends payable on the Preference Shares are in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of Preference Shares (voting together as a class with all other classes or series of parity securities upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to elect one additional director to serve on our board of directors, and the size of our board of directors will be increased as needed to accommodate such change (unless the size of our board of directors already has been increased by reason of the election of a director by holders of parity securities upon which like voting rights have been conferred and with which the Preference Shares voted as a class for the election of such director). The right of such holders of Preference Shares to elect a member of our board of directors will continue until such time as all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Preference Shares have been paid in full.
B. Related Party Transactions
Relationship with GasLog Partners
GasLog Partners was formed by us in January 2014 to own, operate and acquire LNG carriers engaged in LNG transportation under long-term charters, which we define as charters of five full years or more. In May 2014, the Partnership completed its initial public offering and its common units began trading on the NYSE. The Partnership conducts its operations through its vessel-owning subsidiaries and as of February 27, 2017, had a fleet of nine LNG carriers. As of February 27, 2017, we hold a 27.57% interest in the Partnership and, as a result of our ownership of the general partner, and the fact that the general partner elects the majority of the Partnership's directors in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, we have the ability to control the Partnership's affairs and policies.
Quarterly Cash Dividends
We are entitled to distributions on our general and limited partner interests in GasLog Partners. These interests consist of common units, subordinated units, incentive distribution rights and general partner interests. Under the Partnership Agreement, during the subordination period, the holders of the common units will have the right to receive distributions of available cash from operating surplus in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution of $0,375 per unit per quarter, plus any arrearages in the payment of minimum quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters, before any distributions of available cash from operating surplus may be made on the subordinated units.
92

The amount of the minimum quarterly distribution is $0,375 per unit or $1.50 per unit on an annualized basis and is made in the following manner, during the subordination period:
· first, 98.0% to the common unitholders, pro rata, and 2.0% to the general partner until each common unit has received a minimum quarterly distribution of $0,375;
· second, 98.0% to the common unitholders, pro rata, and 2.0% to the general partner, until each common unit has received an amount equal to any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for prior quarters during the subordination period; and
· third, 98.0% to the holders of subordinated units, pro rata, and 2.0% to the general partner until each subordinated unit has received a minimum quarterly distribution of $0,375.
We currently hold all of the incentive distribution rights in GasLog Partners. Incentive distribution rights represent the right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash from operating surplus after the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels have been achieved.
If for any quarter:
· GasLog Partners has distributed available cash from operating surplus to the common and subordinated unitholders in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution; and
· GasLog Partners has distributed available cash from operating surplus on outstanding common units in an amount necessary to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution;
then, GasLog Partners will distribute any additional available cash from operating surplus for that quarter among the unitholders and the general partner in the following manner:
· first, 98.0% to all unitholders, pro rata, and 2.0% to the general partner, until each unitholder receives a total of $0.43125 per unit for that quarter;
· second, 85.0% to all unitholders, pro rata, 2.0% to the general partner and 13.0% to the holders of the incentive distribution rights, pro rata, until each unitholder receives a total of $0.46875 per unit for that quarter;
· third, 75.0% to all unitholders, pro rata, 2.0% to the general partner and 23.0% to the holders of the incentive distribution rights, pro rata, until each unitholder receives a total of $0.5625 per unit for that quarter; and
· thereafter, 50.0% to all unitholders, pro rata, 2.0% to the general partner and 48.0% to the holders of the incentive distribution rights, pro rata.
In each case, the amount of the target distribution set forth above is exclusive of any distributions to common unitholders to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution. The percentage interests set forth above assume that the general partner maintains its 2.0% general partner interest and that the Partnership does not issue additional classes of equity securities.
As holder of the 2.0% general partner interest in GasLog Partners, we are entitled to 2.0% of all distributions made by GasLog Partners prior to its liquidation. The general partner, our wholly owned subsidiary, has the right, but not the obligation, to contribute a proportionate amount of capital to GasLog Partners to maintain its 2.0% general partner interest if the Partnership issues additional units.
We received total distributions from GasLog Partners of $21.53 million in 2016.
Omnibus Agreement
On May 12, 2014, we entered into an omnibus agreement with GasLog Partners and certain of its subsidiaries. The following discussion describes certain provisions of the omnibus agreement.
93

Noncompetition; Five-Year Vessel Restricted Business Opportunities
Under the omnibus agreement, we have agreed, and have caused our controlled affiliates (other than GasLog Partners, its general partner and its subsidiaries) to agree, not to acquire, own, operate or charter any LNG carrier with a cargo capacity greater than 75,000 cbm engaged in oceangoing LNG transportation under a charter for five full years or more. For purposes of this section, we refer to these vessels, together with any related charters, as "Five-Year Vessels" and to all other LNG carriers, together with any related charters, as "Non-Five-Year Vessels". In the event that we acquire, operate or put under charter a Five-Year Vessel, then we will be required, within 30 calendar days after the consummation of the acquisition or the commencement of the operations or charter, to notify GasLog Partners and offer it the opportunity to purchase such Five-Year Vessel at fair market value. The restrictions in this paragraph will not prevent us or any of our controlled affiliates (other than GasLog Partners and its subsidiaries) from:
(1) acquiring, owning, operating or chartering Non-Five-Year Vessels;
(2) acquiring one or more Five-Year Vessels if we promptly offer to sell the vessel to GasLog Partners for the acquisition price plus any administrative costs (including re-flagging and reasonable legal costs) associated with the transfer to GasLog Partners at the time of the acquisition;
(3) putting a Non-Five-Year Vessel under charter for five full years or more if we offer to sell the vessel to GasLog Partners for fair market value (x) promptly after the time it becomes a Five-Year Vessel and (y) at each renewal or extension of that charter for five full years or more;
(4) acquiring one or more Five-Year Vessels as part of the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business or package of assets and owning, operating or chartering those vessels; provided, however, that:
(a) if less than a majority of the value of the business or assets acquired is attributable to Five-Year Vessels, as determined in good faith by our board of directors, we must offer to sell such vessels to GasLog Partners for their fair market value plus any additional tax or other similar costs that we incur in connection with the acquisition and the transfer of such vessels to GasLog Partners separate from the acquired business; and
(b) if a majority or more of the value of the business or assets acquired is attributable to Five-Year Vessels, as determined in good faith by our board of directors, we must notify GasLog Partners of the proposed acquisition in advance. Not later than 30 days following receipt of such notice, GasLog Partners will notify us if it wishes to acquire such vessels in cooperation and simultaneously with us acquiring the Non-Five-Year Vessels. If GasLog Partners does not notify us of its intent to pursue the acquisition within 30 days, we may proceed with the acquisition and then offer to sell such vessels to GasLog Partners as provided in (a) above;
(5) acquiring a non-controlling equity ownership, voting or profit participation interest in any company, business or pool of assets;
(6) acquiring, owning, operating or chartering any Five-Year Vessel if GasLog Partners does not fulfill its obligation to purchase such vessel in accordance with the terms of any existing or future agreement;
(7) acquiring, owning, operating or chartering a Five-Year Vessel subject to the offers to GasLog Partners described in paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) above pending its determination whether to accept such offers and pending the closing of any offers it accepts;
(8) providing ship management services relating to any vessel;
(9) owning or operating any Five-Year Vessel that we owned on the closing date of GasLog Partners' IPO and that was not part of its fleet as of such date; or
(10) acquiring, owning, operating or chartering a Five-Year Vessel if GasLog Partners has previously advised us that it consents to such acquisition, ownership, operation or charter.
94

If we or any of our controlled affiliates (other than GasLog Partners, its general partner or its subsidiaries) acquires, owns, operates or charters Five-Year Vessels pursuant to any of the exceptions described above, we may not subsequently expand that portion of our business other than pursuant to those exceptions. However, such Five-Year Vessels could eventually compete with GasLog Partners' vessels upon their re-chartering.
In addition, under the omnibus agreement GasLog Partners has agreed, and has caused its subsidiaries to agree, to acquire, own, operate or charter Five-Year Vessels only. The restrictions in this paragraph will not:
(1) prevent GasLog Partners or any of its subsidiaries from owning, operating or chartering any Non-Five-Year Vessel that was previously a Five-Year Vessel while owned by GasLog Partners or any of its subsidiaries;
(2) prevent GasLog Partners or any of its subsidiaries from acquiring Non-Five-Year Vessels as part of the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business or package of assets and owning, operating or chartering those vessels; provided, however, that:
(a) if less than a majority of the value of the business or assets acquired is attributable to Non-Five-Year Vessels, as determined in good faith by GasLog Partners, the Partnership must offer to sell such vessels to us for their fair market value plus any additional tax or other similar costs that GasLog Partners incurs in connection with the acquisition and the transfer of such vessels to us separate from the acquired business; and
(b) if a majority or more of the value of the business or assets acquired is attributable to Non-Five-Year Vessels, as determined in good faith by GasLog Partners, the Partnership must notify us of the proposed acquisition in advance. Not later than 30 days following receipt of such notice, we must notify GasLog Partners if we wish to acquire the Non-Five-Year Vessels in cooperation and simultaneously with GasLog Partners acquiring the Five-Year Vessels. If we do not notify GasLog Partners of our intent to pursue the acquisition within 30 days, the Partnership may proceed with the acquisition and then offer to sell such vessels to us as provided in (a) above;
(3) prevent GasLog Partners or any of its subsidiaries from acquiring, owning, operating or chartering any Non-Five-Year Vessels subject to the offer to us described in paragraph (2) above, pending our determination whether to accept such offer and pending the closing of any offer we accept; or
(4) prevent GasLog Partners or any of its subsidiaries from acquiring, owning, operating or chartering Non-Five-Year Vessels if we have previously advised the Partnership that we consent to such acquisition, ownership, operation or charter.
If GasLog Partners or any of its subsidiaries acquires, owns, operates or charters Non-Five-Year Vessels pursuant to any of the exceptions described above, neither the Partnership nor any subsidiary may subsequently expand that portion of its business other than pursuant to those exceptions.
During the 30-day period after our notice and offer of an opportunity to purchase a Five-Year Vessel, we and GasLog Partners will negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement on the fair market value (and any applicable break-up costs) of the relevant vessel. If we do not reach an agreement within such 30-day period, a mutually-agreed upon investment banking firm, ship broker or other expert advisor will be engaged to determine the fair market value (and any applicable break-up costs) of the relevant vessel and other outstanding terms, and GasLog Partners will have the option, but not the obligation, to purchase the relevant vessel on such terms. GasLog Partners' ability to consummate the acquisition of such Five-Year Vessel from us will be subject to obtaining any consents of governmental authorities and other non-affiliated third parties and to all agreements existing with respect to such Five-Year Vessel. Under the omnibus agreement, we will indemnify GasLog Partners against losses arising from the failure to obtain any consent or governmental permit necessary to own or operate the fleet in substantially the same manner that the vessels were
95

owned and operated by us immediately prior to the Partnership's acquisition of such vessels. See "--Indemnification".
Upon a change of control of GasLog Partners or its general partner, the noncompetition provisions of the omnibus agreement will terminate immediately. Upon a change of control of GasLog, the noncompetition provisions of the omnibus agreement applicable to us will terminate at the time that is the later of the date of the change of control and the date on which all of our outstanding subordinated units have converted to common units. On the date on which a majority of GasLog Partners' directors ceases to consist of directors that were (1) appointed by the Partnership's general partner prior to its first annual meeting of unitholders and (2) recommended for election by a majority of the Partnership's appointed directors, the noncompetition provisions applicable to us shall terminate immediately.
LNG Carrier Purchase Options
Under the omnibus agreement, GasLog Partners has the option to purchase from us: (i) the Solaris andthe GasLog Greece, the GasLog Glasgow, the GasLog Geneva and the GasLog Gibraltar within 36 months after we notify the Partnership's board of directors of the vessel's acceptance by her charterer, (ii) the Methane Lydon Volney within 36 months after the closing of our IPO on May 12, 2014 which option will expire in May 2017 if not extended, and (iii) as provided for under the addendum to the omnibus agreement dated April 21, 2015 among GasLog, GasLog Partners, the general partner and GasLog Partners Holdings LLC, the Methane Becki Anne and the right to acquire GAS-twenty six Ltd. with its long-term bareboat charter of (and right to acquire) the Methane Julia Louise (which is subject to a multi-year charter to MSL) within 36 months after the completion of their acquisition by GasLog on March 31, 2015. In addition, on April 21, 2015, we signed an agreement with MSL for newbuildings Hull Nos. 2130, 2800 and 2131 to be chartered to MSL upon deliveries in 2018 and 2019 respectively, for average initial terms of approximately 9.5 years. Within 30 days of the commencement of each charter, we will be required to offer GasLog Partners an opportunity to purchase each vessel at fair market value as determined pursuant to the omnibus agreement.
On July 11, 2016, we signed an agreement with Total for newbuilding Hull No. 2801 to be chartered to Total upon delivery in 2018 for an initial term of seven years. Within 30 days of the commencement of the charter, we will be required to offer GasLog Partners the opportunity to purchase the vessel at fair market value as determined pursuant to the omnibus agreement.
Furthermore, on October 20, 2016, we signed an agreement with Centrica for newbuilding Hull No. 2212 to be chartered to Centrica upon delivery in 2019 for an initial term of seven years. Within 30 days of the commencement of the charter, we will be required to offer GasLog Partners the opportunity to purchase the vessel at fair market value as determined pursuant to the omnibus agreement.
In each case, GasLog Partners' option to purchase is at fair market value as determined pursuant to the omnibus agreement. If we and GasLog Partners are unable to agree upon the fair market value of any of these optional vessels, the respective fair market values will be determined by a mutually acceptable investment banking firm, ship broker or other expert advisor, and GasLog Partners will have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the vessel at such price. GasLog Partners' ability to consummate the acquisition of such vessels from us will be subject to obtaining any consents of governmental authorities and other non-affiliated third parties and to all agreements existing as of the closing date in respect of such vessels.
On the date on which a majority of GasLog Partners' directors ceases to consist of directors that were (1) appointed by the Partnership's general partner prior to its first annual meeting of unitholders and (2) recommended for election by a majority of the Partnership's appointed directors, the LNG carrier purchase options shall terminate immediately.
96

Rights o f First Offer
Under the omnibus agreement, we and our subsidiaries have granted to GasLog Partners a right of first offer on any proposed sale, transfer or other disposition of any Five-Year Vessels or Non-Five-Year Vessels owned by us. Under the omnibus agreement, GasLog Partners and its subsidiaries have agreed to grant a similar right of first offer to us for any Five-Year Vessels they might own. These rights of first offer will not apply to a (i) sale, transfer or other disposition of vessels between any affiliated subsidiaries or pursuant to the terms of any current or future charter or other agreement with a charter party or (ii) merger with or into, or sale of substantially all of the assets to, an unaffiliated third party.
Prior to engaging in any negotiation regarding any vessel disposition with respect to a Five-Year Vessel with an unaffiliated third party or any Non-Five-Year Vessel, we or GasLog Partners, as the case may be, will deliver a written notice to the other relevant party setting forth the material terms and conditions of the proposed transaction. During the 30-day period after the delivery of such notice, we and GasLog Partners, as the case may be, will negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement on the transaction. If we do not reach an agreement within such 30-day period, we or GasLog Partners, as the case may be, will be able within the next 180 calendar days to sell, transfer, dispose or re-charter the vessel to a third party (or to agree in writing to undertake such transaction with a third party) on terms generally no less favorable to us or GasLog Partners, as the case may be, than those offered pursuant to the written notice. Our ability to consummate the acquisition of such Five-Year Vessel from GasLog Partners will be subject to obtaining any consents of governmental authorities and other non-affiliated third parties and to all agreements existing in respect of such Five-Year Vessel.
Upon a change of control of GasLog Partners or its general partner, the right of first offer provisions of the omnibus agreement will terminate immediately. Upon a change of control of us, the right of first offer provisions applicable to GasLog under the omnibus agreement will terminate at the time that is the later of the date of the change of control and the date on which all of GasLog Partners' outstanding subordinated units have converted to common units. On the date on which a majority of GasLog Partners' directors ceases to consist of directors that were (i) appointed by the Partnership's general partner prior to its first annual meeting of unitholders and (ii) recommended for election by a majority of the Partnership's appointed directors, the provisions related to the rights of first offer granted to the Partnership by us shall terminate immediately.
For purposes of the omnibus agreement, a "change of control" means, with respect to any "applicable person", any of the following events: (a) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the applicable person's assets to any other person, unless immediately following such sale, lease, exchange or other transfer such assets are owned, directly or indirectly, by the applicable person; (b) the consolidation or merger of the applicable person with or into another person pursuant to a transaction in which the outstanding voting securities of the applicable person are changed into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where (i) the outstanding voting securities of the applicable person are changed into or exchanged for voting securities of the surviving person or its parent and (ii) the holders of the voting securities of the applicable person immediately prior to such transaction own, directly or indirectly, not less than a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving person or its parent immediately after such transaction; and (c) a "person" or "group" (within the meaning of Sections 13(d) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the "Exchange Act"), other than us or our affiliates with respect to the general partner, being or becoming the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) of more than 50.0% of all of the then outstanding voting securities of the applicable person, except in a merger or consolidation which would not constitute a change of control under clause (b) above.
Indemnification
Under the omnibus agreement, we will indemnify GasLog Partners after the closing of its IPO for a period of five years (and we will indemnify the Partnership for a period of at least three years
97

after its purchase of any vessels subject to purchase options, if applicable) against certain environmental and toxic tort liabilities with respect to the vessels that are contributed or sold to the Partnership to the extent arising prior to the time such vessels were contributed or sold to the Partnership. Liabilities resulting from a change in law after the closing of the IPO are excluded from the environmental indemnity. There is an aggregate cap of $5 million on the amount of indemnity coverage provided by us for environmental and toxic tort liabilities. No claim may be made unless the aggregate dollar amount of all claims exceeds $500,000, in which case we are liable for claims only to the extent such aggregate amount exceeds $500,000.
We will also indemnify GasLog Partners for liabilities related to:
· certain defects in title to GasLog Partners' initial fleet and any failure to obtain, prior to the time they were contributed to the Partnership, certain consents and permits necessary to conduct the Partnership's business, which liabilities arise within three years after the closing of the Partnership's IPO; and
· certain tax liabilities attributable to the operation of the assets contributed or sold to the Partnership prior to the time they were contributed or sold.
Restrictive Covenant Agreement
On April 4, 2012, Peter G. Livanos and Blenheim Holdings entered into a Restrictive Covenant Agreement with us, pursuant to which Mr. Livanos is prohibited from directly or indirectly owning, operating or managing LNG vessels, other than pursuant to his involvement with us. The restrictions will terminate in the event that Mr. Livanos ceases to beneficially own at least 20.0% of our issued and outstanding share capital.
Notwithstanding these restrictions, Mr. Livanos is permitted to engage in the following activities:
· passive ownership (a) of minority interests in any business that is not primarily engaged in owning, operating or managing LNG vessels or (b) constituting less than 5.0% of any publicly listed company; and
· non-passive participation in a business that acquires an interest in the ownership, operation or management of LNG vessels, provided that as promptly as reasonably practicable either (A) the business enters into an agreement to dispose of such competitive activity and such disposition is completed within a reasonable time, or (B) Mr. Livanos's participation in such business is changed so as to satisfy the exception for passive ownership of minority interests in a business that is not primarily engaged in a competitive activity.
The restrictions described above do not apply to transactions by independent fund managers not acting under the direction or control of Mr. Livanos or Blenheim Holdings.
As noted above, Mr. Livanos and Blenheim Holdings are permitted under the terms of the restrictive covenant agreement to dispose of our common shares in the following circumstances:
· pursuant to any transfer by Blenheim Holdings to its shareholders (including any division of the ownership interests in Blenheim Holdings of Mr. Livanos and members of the Radziwill family), provided that the transferee or transferees agree to be bound by the share transfer restrictions of the restrictive covenant agreement;
· pursuant to any private sale to a strategic investor in the Company, provided that the strategic investor agrees to be bound by the share transfer restrictions of the restrictive covenant agreement;
· in connection with any sale or transfer that would result in a change in control of the Company, provided that such change in control has been approved by our board of directors; and
· in transactions relating to shares acquired following the effective date of the restrictive covenant agreement.
For purposes of the restrictive covenant agreement, a "change of control" means Mr. Livanos and Blenheim Holdings cease to beneficially own, in the aggregate, at least 38.0% of the issued and
98

outstanding share capital of the Company. The share transfer restrictions described above will terminate as to any person that ceases to beneficially own, or does not beneficially own, at least 20.0% of our issued and outstanding share capital.
Registration Rights Agreement On April 4, 2012, we entered into a registration rights agreement with certain of our shareholders, pursuant to which we granted such
shareholders and their transferees the right, under certain circumstances and subject to certain restrictions, including restrictions included in the lock up agreements to which they will be a party, to require us to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, our common shares held by those persons. Under the registration rights agreement, certain of our shareholders and their transferees have the right to request us to register the sale of shares held by them on their behalf and may require us to make available shelf registration statements permitting sales of shares into the market from time to time over an extended period. While these demand registration rights are subject to certain timing and other restrictions, there is no limit on the number of times a shareholder may exercise such rights. In addition, those persons have the ability to exercise certain piggyback registration rights in connection with registered offerings initiated by us. In March 2014, in response to a Demand Registration Request (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form F-3 registering the common shares entitled to registration rights in addition to other common shares held by the Company's directors and officers.
Subscription Agreements On January 16, 2014, we entered into subscription agreements with certain of our directors and officers for a concurrent private placement of
2,317,460 common shares at a price of $15.75 per share.
Indemnification Agreements We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers which provide, among other things, that we will indemnify our
directors and officers, under the circumstances and to the extent provided for therein, for expenses, damages, judgments, fines, settlements and fees that they may be required to pay in actions or proceedings to which they are or may be made a party by reason of such person's position as a director, officer, employee or other agent of the Company, subject to, and to the maximum extent permitted by, applicable law.
Office Space and Related Arrangements Through our subsidiary GasLog LNG Services, we lease our office space in Piraeus, Greece from an entity controlled by Ceres Shipping, Nea
Dimitra Ktimatikh Kai Emporikh S.A. The lease agreement is filed with the Greek authorities, and has been entered into on market rates. GasLog LNG Services has also entered into an agreement with Seres S.A., an entity controlled by the Livanos family, for the latter to provide
catering services to the staff based in our Piraeus office. Amounts paid pursuant to the agreement are generally less than 10 per person per day, but are slightly higher on special occasions. In addition, GasLog LNG Services has entered into an agreement with Seres S.A. for the latter to provide telephone and documentation services for our staff based in Piraeus. Amounts paid pursuant to the agreement are less than 100,000 per year.
Egypt LNG We have a 25.0% ownership interest in Egypt LNG, whose principal asset is the LNG carrier Methane Nile Eagle, which is currently operating
under a 20-year time charter with a subsidiary of BG Group. Through our subsidiary GasLog LNG Services, we supervised the construction of the Methane Nile Eagle, which was delivered from the shipyard in 2007. Pursuant to a ship management agreement between GasLog LNG Services and Egypt LNG, the vessel has operated under our
99

technical management since its delivery. From January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, we received a total of approximately $0.21 million in revenues from Egypt LNG in respect of our vessel management services. On October 29, 2015, Egypt LNG and BG Group mutually agreed to lay up the Methane Nile Eagle for a period of approximately one year. The charterer continued to pay charter hire costs adjusted for net savings in operating expenses and insurance as a result of the vessel being laid up. The Methane Nile Eagle was re-activated on October 15, 2016.
Consulting Services Agreements GasLog entered into a consulting agreement with Unisea Maritime Ltd ("Unisea"), an entity controlled by the Livanos family, in consideration
of the consulting services performed by Unisea in respect of the sale and leaseback transaction for the Methane Julia Louise. Under the terms of the consulting agreement, GasLog agreed to pay a brokerage commission fee equal to 0.25% of the agreed charter rates under the sale and leaseback transaction plus reasonable expenses (in line with the Company's policies). The brokerage commission fee was paid in advance for the full 20--year period of the bareboat charter, discounted to the date of the agreement at an annual discount rate of 7.5%.
GasLog entered into a consulting agreement for the services of an employee of Ceres Monaco S.A.M, an entity controlled by the Livanos family, for consultancy services in connection with the acquisition of GasLog's shareholding in Gastrade. GasLog agreed to pay a fixed fee for work carried out between May 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016 in the sum of US$100,000 and an ongoing consultancy arrangement fee of US$12,000 per month for a minimum of 12 days per month, terminable upon notice by GasLog.
Other Transactions For a description of additional related party transactions, see Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual
report.
Procedures for Review and Approval of Related Party Transactions Related party transactions, which means transactions in which the Company or one of its subsidiaries is a participant and any of the Company's
directors, executive officers or significant shareholders, or any members of their immediate families or entities controlled by them, have a direct or indirect interest, will be subject to review and approval or ratification by our audit and risk committee in accordance with the Related Party Transaction Policy adopted by such committee.
C. Interests of Experts and Counsel Not applicable.
ITEM 8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information See "Item 18. Financial Statements" below.
Legal Proceedings We have not been involved in any legal proceedings that we believe may have a significant effect on our business, financial position, results of
operations or liquidity, and we are not aware of any proceedings that are pending or threatened that may have a material effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, principally property damage and personal injury claims. We expect that these claims would be covered by insurance, subject to customary deductibles. However, those claims, even if lacking merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.

Preference Shares Dividend Requirements
Dividends on Preference Shares are payable quarterly on each of January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, or the next succeeding business day, as and if declared by our board of directors out of legally available funds for such purpose. The dividend rate for the Preference Shares is 8.75% per annum per $25.00 of liquidation preference per share (equal to $2.18750 per annum per share). The dividend rates are not subject to adjustment. We paid dividends to holders of our Preference Shares of $0.510417 per share on July 1, 2015 and $0.546875 per share on October 1, 2015, January 4, 2016, April 1, 2016, July 1, 2016, October 3, 2016 and January 3, 2017. Our Preference Shares dividend payment obligations impact our future liquidity needs.

Common Shares Dividend Policy

We paid our first cash dividend since becoming a public company in March 2012 on December 17, 2012 in an amount of $0.11 per share. We have subsequently paid dividends to holders of our common shares of $0.11 per share on March 25, 2013, June 11, 2013 and September 13, 2013, $0.12 per share on December 9, 2013, March 25, 2014, June 11, 2014 and September 8, 2014, and $0.14 per share on December 5, 2014, March 13, 2015, August 20, 2015, November 19, 2015, March 17, 2016, May 26, 2016, August 25, 2016 and November 24, 2016.

As our fleet expands, we will evaluate changes to the quarterly dividend consistent with our cash flow and liquidity position. Our policy is to pay dividends in amounts that will allow us to retain sufficient liquidity to fund our obligations as well as execute our business plan going forward. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and the requirements of Bermuda law. In addition, our credit facilities impose limitations on our ability to pay dividends. Our board of directors will determine the timing and amount of all dividend payments, based on various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, restrictions in our credit facilities and the provisions of Bermuda law. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay quarterly dividends. See "Item 3. Key Information --D. Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business" for a discussion of risks related to our ability to pay dividends.

Set out below is a table showing the dividends declared on our common shares in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

ITEM 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
A. Share Capital Our authorized share capital consists of 500,000,000 shares, par value $0.01 per share. As of December 31, 2016, the share capital consisted of
80,561,353 issued and outstanding common shares, par value $0.01 per share, 431,773 treasury shares and 4,600,000 Preference Shares. Pursuant to our bye-laws, subject to any resolution of the shareholders to the contrary, our board of directors is authorized to issue any of our
authorized but unissued common shares. There are no limitations on the right of non-Bermudians or non-residents of Bermuda to hold or vote our shares.
B. Memorandum of Association We are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of Bermuda. We are registered with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda under
registration number 33928. We were incorporated on July 16, 2003 under the name Gaslog Ltd. We effected a change of name from "Gaslog Ltd." to "GasLog Ltd." on August 23, 2011 in compliance with the Companies Act. Our registered office is located at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton, HM 11, Bermuda.
The objects of our business are unrestricted, and the Company has the capacity of a natural person. We can therefore undertake activities without restriction on our capacity.
Common Shares Holders of our common shares have no pre-emptive, redemption, conversion or sinking fund rights. Holders of our common shares are entitled
to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of holders of common shares. Unless a different majority is required by law or by our bye laws, resolutions to be approved by holders of our common shares require approval by a simple majority of votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present.
In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of our common shares are entitled to share equally and ratably in our assets, if any, remaining after the payment of all of our debts and liabilities, subject to any liquidation preference on any issued and outstanding preference shares.
Preference Shares Pursuant to Bermuda law and our bye-laws, our board of directors by resolution may establish one or more series of preference shares having
such number of shares, designations, dividend rates, relative voting rights, conversion or exchange rights, redemption rights, liquidation rights and other relative participation, optional or other special rights, qualifications, limitations or restrictions as may be fixed by the board without any further shareholder approval. O f the Company's 500 million authorised shares 4.6 million have been designated 8.75% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference Shares.
Dividend Rights Under Bermuda law, a company may not declare or pay dividends if there are reasonable grounds for believing that: (i) the company is, or
would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (ii) the realizable value of its assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. Under our bye-laws, each common share is entitled to dividends if, as and when dividends are declared by our board of directors.
Any cash dividends payable to holders of our common shares listed on the NYSE will be paid to American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent in the United States for disbursement to those holders.
103

Variation of Rights
If at any time we have more than one class of shares, the rights attaching to any class, unless otherwise provided for by the terms of issue of the relevant class, may be varied with the sanction of a resolution passed by a majority of the issued shares of such class. Our bye-laws specify that the creation or issue of shares ranking equally with existing shares will not, unless expressly provided by the terms of issue of existing shares, vary the rights attached to existing shares.
Transfer of Shares
Our board of directors may in its absolute discretion and without assigning any reason refuse to register the transfer of a share that is not fully paid. Our board of directors may also refuse to recognize an instrument of transfer of a share unless it is accompanied by the relevant share certificate and such other evidence of the transferor's right to make the transfer as our board of directors shall reasonably require. In addition, our board of directors may refuse to register the transfer of a share unless all applicable consents, authorizations and permissions of any governmental body or agency in Bermuda have been obtained. Subject to these restrictions, a holder of common shares may transfer the title to all or any of his common shares by completing a form of transfer in the form set out in our bye-laws (or as near thereto as circumstances admit) or in such other common form as the board may accept. The instrument of transfer must be signed by the transferor and transferee, although in the case of a fully paid share our board of directors may accept the instrument signed only by the transferor.
Meetings of Shareholders
We are required to convene at least one general meeting of shareholders each calendar year. Bermuda law provides that a special general meeting of shareholders may be called by the board of directors of a company and must be called upon the request of shareholders holding not less than 10.0% of the paid-up capital of the company carrying the right to vote at general meetings. Bermuda law also requires that shareholders be given at least five days' advance notice of a general meeting, but an unintentional failure notice to any person does not invalidate the proceedings at a meeting. Our bye-laws provide that the Chairman or our board of directors may convene an annual general meeting or a special general meeting. Under our bye-laws, at least 10 days' notice of an annual general meeting or a special general meeting must be given to each shareholder entitled to vote at such meeting. This notice requirement is subject to the ability to hold such meetings on shorter notice if such notice is agreed: (i) in the case of an annual general meeting, by all of the shareholders entitled to attend and vote at such meeting; or (ii) in the case of a special general meeting, by a majority in number of the shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the meeting holding not less than 95.0% in nominal value of the shares entitled to vote at such meeting. The quorum required for a general meeting of shareholders is one or more persons present in person throughout the meeting and representing in person or by proxy in excess of 50.0% of all issued and outstanding common shares. General meetings can be convened at a location in or outside of Bermuda. Our bye-laws provide that our board of directors may, but is not required to, make arrangements permitting shareholders to participate in general meetings by such telephonic, electronic or other communications facilities or means as permit all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously.
Access to Books and Records and Dissemination of Information
Members of the general public have a right to inspect public documents of the Company available at the office of the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda. These documents include the Company's memorandum of association, including its objects and powers, and certain alterations to the memorandum of association. Our shareholders have the additional right to inspect the bye-laws of the Company, minutes of general meetings and the Company's audited financial statements, which must be presented to the annual general meeting. The Company's register of members is also open to inspection by shareholders and by members of the general public without charge. The register of members is required under Bermuda law to be open for inspection for not less than two hours in
104

any business day (subject to the ability of a company to close the register of members for not more than thirty days in a year). The Company is required to maintain its share register in Bermuda but may, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, establish a branch register outside of Bermuda. The Company is required to keep at its registered office a register of directors and officers that is open for inspection for not less than two hours in any business day by members of the public without charge. Bermuda law does not, however, provide a general right for shareholders to inspect or obtain copies of any other corporate records.
Election and Removal of Directors
Our bye-laws provide that our board shall consist of no less than three directors and no more than fifteen directors, as the board of directors may from time to time determine. Our board of directors consists of ten directors.
Any shareholder wishing to propose for election as a director someone who is not an existing director or is not proposed by our board must give notice of the intention to propose the person for election. Where a director is to be elected at an annual general meeting, that notice must be given not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days before the anniversary of the last annual general meeting prior to the giving of the notice or, in the event the annual general meeting is called for a date that is not 30 days before or after such anniversary, the notice must be given not later than 10 days following the earlier of the date on which notice of the annual general meeting was posted to shareholders or the date on which public disclosure of the date of the annual general meeting was made. Where a director is to be elected at a special general meeting that notice must be given not later than 10 days following the earlier of the date on which notice of the special general meeting was posted to shareholders or the date on which public disclosure of the date of the special general meeting was made.
A director may be removed by the shareholders, provided notice of the shareholders' meeting convened to remove the director is given to the director. The notice must contain a statement of the intention to remove the director and must be served on the director not less than 14 days before the meeting. The director is entitled to attend the meeting and be heard on the motion for his or her removal.
Holders of our Preference Shares generally have no voting rights except (!) in respect of amendments to the Memorandum of Association which would adversely vary the rights of the Preference Shares (ii) in the event that the Company proposes to issue any parity shares if the cumulative dividends payable on issued and outstanding Preference Shares are in arrears or any senior shares or (iii) in the event of a proposed amalgamation or merger of the Company. However, if and whenever dividends payable on the Preference Shares are in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of Preference Shares (voting together as a class with all other classes or series of parity securities upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to elect one additional director to serve on our board of directors, and the size of our board of directors will be increased as needed to accommodate such change (unless the size of our board of directors already has been increased by reason of the election of a director by holders of parity securities upon which like voting rights have been conferred and with which the Preference Shares voted as a class for the election of such director). The right of such holders of Preference Shares to elect a member of our board of directors will continue until such time as all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Preference Shares have been paid in full.
Proceedings of Board of Directors
Our bye-laws provide that our business is to be managed and conducted by our board of directors. Bermuda law requires that our directors be individuals, but there is no requirement in our bye-laws or Bermuda law that directors hold any of our shares. There is also no requirement in our bye-laws or Bermuda law that our directors must retire at a certain age.
The remuneration of our directors is determined by the board of directors, and there is no requirement that a specified number or percentage of "independent" directors must approve any
105

such determination. Our directors may also be paid all travel, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by them in connection with our business or their duties as directors.
Director Conflicts of Interest
Any conflict of interest question involving one or more of the Company's directors will be resolved by the audit and risk committee of the board of directors.
In the event that a director has a direct or indirect interest in any contract or arrangement with the Company, provided that the director discloses such interest as required by Bermuda law, such director is entitled under our bye-laws to vote in respect of any such contract or arrangement in which he or she is interested unless he or she is disqualified from voting by the Chairman of our board of directors. In the event that the Chairman has disclosed a direct or indirect interest in a contract or arrangement with us, the determination as to whether the Chairman and any other interested director should be disqualified from voting will be made by a majority of the disinterested directors.
Bermuda law prohibits any director (including the spouse or children of the director or any company of which such director, spouse or children own or control more than 20.0% of the capital or loan debt) from borrowing from us (except loans made to directors who are bona fide employees or former employees pursuant to an employees' share scheme) unless shareholders holding 90.0% of the total voting rights have consented to the loan.
Indemnification of Directors and Officers
Section 98 of the Companies Act provides generally that a Bermuda company may indemnify its directors, officers and auditors against any liability which by virtue of any rule of law would otherwise be imposed on them in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust, except in cases where such liability arises from fraud or dishonesty of which such director, officer or auditor may be guilty in relation to the company. Section 98 further provides that a Bermuda company may indemnify its directors, officers and auditors against any liability incurred by them in defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is awarded in their favor or in which they are acquitted or granted relief by the Supreme Court of Bermuda pursuant to section 281 of the Companies Act.
We have adopted provisions in our bye-laws that provide that we shall indemnify our officers and directors in respect of their actions and omissions, except in respect of their fraud or dishonesty. Our bye-laws provide that the shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have, individually or in right of the Company, against any of the Company's directors or officers for any act or failure to act in the performance of such director's or officer's duties, except in respect of any fraud or dishonesty of such director or officer. Section 98A of the Companies Act permits us to purchase and maintain insurance for the benefit of any officer or director in respect of any loss or liability attaching to him in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust, whether or not we may otherwise indemnify such officer or director. We have purchased and maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance for such purpose. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers. See "Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions--B. Related Party Transactions".
Amendment of Memorandum of Association and Bye-laws
Bermuda law provides that the memorandum of association of a company may be amended by a resolution passed at a general meeting of shareholders. Our bye-laws provide that no bye-law shall be rescinded, altered or amended, and no new bye-law shall be made, unless it shall have been approved by a resolution of our board of directors and by a resolution of our shareholders including the affirmative votes of at least a majority of all issued and outstanding shares.
Under Bermuda law, the holders of an aggregate of not less than 20.0% in par value of a company's issued share capital or any class thereof have the right to apply to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for an annulment of any amendment of the memorandum of association adopted by
106

shareholders at any general meeting, other than an amendment which alters or reduces a company's share capital as provided in the Companies Act. Where such an application is made, the amendment becomes effective only to the extent that it is confirmed by the Bermuda court. An application for an annulment of an amendment of the memorandum of association must be made within twenty-one days after the date on which the resolution altering the company's memorandum of association is passed and may be made on behalf of persons entitled to make the application by one or more of their number as they may appoint in writing for the purpose. No application may be made by shareholders voting in favor of the amendment.
Amalgamations, Mergers and Business Combinations
The amalgamation or merger of a Bermuda company with another company or corporation (other than certain affiliated companies) requires the amalgamation or merger agreement to be approved by the company's board of directors and by its shareholders. Unless the company's bye-laws provide otherwise, the approval of 75.0% of the shareholders voting at such meeting is required to approve the amalgamation or merger agreement, and the quorum for such meeting must be two persons holding or representing more than one-third of the issued shares of the company. Our bye-laws provide that a merger or an amalgamation must only be approved by the affirmative votes of a majority of the votes attaching to all issued and outstanding shares entitling the shareholder to vote on such resolutions.
Under Bermuda law, in the event of an amalgamation or merger of a Bermuda company with another company or corporation, a shareholder of the Bermuda company who did not vote in favor of the amalgamation or merger and who is not satisfied that fair value has been offered for such shareholder's shares may, within one month of notice of the shareholders' meeting, apply to the Supreme Court of Bermuda to appraise the fair value of those shares.
Shareholder Suits
Class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under Bermuda law. The Bermuda courts, however, would ordinarily be expected to permit a shareholder to commence an action in the name of a company to remedy a wrong to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of the company or illegal, or would result in the violation of the company's memorandum of association or bye-laws. Furthermore, consideration would be given by a Bermuda court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or, for instance, where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of the company's shareholders than that which actually approved it.
When the affairs of a company are being conducted in a manner that is oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of some part of the shareholders, one or more shareholders may apply to the Supreme Court of Bermuda, which may make such order as it sees fit, including an order regulating the conduct of the company's affairs in the future or ordering the purchase of the shares of any shareholders by other shareholders or by the company.
Our bye-laws contain a provision which provides that in the event any dispute arises concerning the Companies Act or out of our bye-laws, including whether there has been a breach of the Companies Act or our bye-laws by an officer or director, any such dispute shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Bermuda. In addition, our bye-laws contain a provision by virtue of which our shareholders waive any claim or right of action that they have, both individually and on our behalf, against any director or officer in relation to any action or failure to take action by such director or officer, except in respect of any fraud or dishonesty of such director or officer.
Capitalization of Profits and Reserves
Pursuant to our bye-laws, our board of directors may (i) capitalize any part of the amount of our share premium or other reserve accounts or any amount credited to our profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution by applying such sum in paying up unissued shares to be
107

allotted as fully paid bonus shares pro rata (except in connection with the conversion of shares) to the shareholders; or (ii) capitalize any sum standing to the credit of a reserve account or sums otherwise available for dividend or distribution by paying up in full, partly paid or nil paid shares of those shareholders who would have been entitled to such sums if they were distributed by way of dividend or distribution.
Calls on Shares and Forfeiture
In the event of any issuance by the Company of shares that are not fully paid, our board of directors may make such calls as it thinks fit upon the holders of such partly paid shares in respect of any amounts unpaid on such shares (and not made payable at fixed times by the terms and conditions of issue). If a call on partly paid shares is not paid on or before the day appointed for payment thereof, the holder of such shares may at the discretion of our board of directors be liable to pay the Company interest on the amount of such call and our board of directors may direct the secretary of the Company to forward such shareholder a notice in writing demanding payment. If the requirements of such notice are not complied with, any such share may at any time thereafter, until the payment of all amounts due, be forfeited by a resolution of our board of directors to that effect, and such share shall thereupon become the property of the Company and may be disposed of as our board of directors shall determine.
Untraced Shareholders
Our bye-laws provide that our board of directors may forfeit any dividend or other monies payable in respect of any shares that remain unclaimed for six years from the date when such monies became due for payment. In addition, we are entitled to cease sending dividend warrants and checks by post or otherwise to a shareholder if such instruments have been returned undelivered to, or left uncashed by, such shareholder on at least two consecutive occasions or, following one such occasion, reasonable enquires have failed to establish the shareholder's new address. This entitlement ceases if the shareholder claims a dividend or cashes a dividend check or a warrant.
Certain Provisions of Bermuda Law
We have been designated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority as a non-resident for Bermuda exchange control purposes. This designation allows us to engage in transactions in currencies other than the Bermuda dollar, and there are no exchange control restrictions on our ability to transfer funds (other than funds denominated in Bermuda dollars) in and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to U.S. residents who are holders of our common shares.
The Bermuda Monetary Authority has given its consent for the issue and free transferability of all our common shares to and between non residents of Bermuda for exchange control purposes, provided that our shares remain listed on an appointed stock exchange, which includes the NYSE. Approvals or permissions given by the Bermuda Monetary Authority do not constitute a guarantee by the Bermuda Monetary Authority as to our performance or our creditworthiness. Accordingly, in giving such consent or permissions, the Bermuda Monetary Authority shall not be liable for the financial soundness, performance or default of our business or for the correctness of any opinions or statements expressed in this annual report. Certain issues and transfers of common shares involving persons deemed resident in Bermuda for exchange control purposes require the specific consent of the Bermuda Monetary Authority.
In accordance with Bermuda law, share certificates are only issued in the names of companies, partnerships or individuals. In the case of a shareholder acting in a special capacity (for example as a trustee), certificates may, at the request of the shareholder, record the capacity in which the shareholder is acting. Notwithstanding such recording of any special capacity, we are not bound to investigate or see to the execution of any such trust. We will take no notice of any trust applicable to any of our shares, whether or not we have been notified of such trust.

D. Exchange Controls and Other Limitations Affecting Security Holders
Under Bermuda law, there are currently no restrictions on the export or import of capital, including foreign exchange controls or restrictions that affect the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of our common shares.
We have been designated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority as a non-resident for Bermuda exchange control purposes. This designation allows us to engage in transactions in currencies other than the Bermuda dollar, and there are no exchange control restrictions on our ability to transfer
110

funds (other than funds denominated in Bermuda dollars) in and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to U.S. residents who are holders of our common shares.
Under Bermuda law, "exempted" companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside Bermuda from a principal place of business in Bermuda. As an exempted company, we may not, without a license or consent granted by the Minister of Finance, participate in certain business transactions, including transactions involving Bermuda landholding rights and the carrying on of business of any kind, for which we are not licensed in Bermuda.
E. Tax Considerations
Bermuda Tax Considerations
The following discussion summarizes the material Bermuda tax consequences to us of our activities and, subject to the limitations described above, to you as a holder of our shares. At the present time, there is no Bermuda income or profits tax, withholding tax, capital gains tax, capital transfer tax, estate duty or inheritance tax payable by us or by our shareholders in respect of our shares. We have obtained an assurance from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda, as amended, that, in the event that any legislation is enacted in Bermuda imposing any tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, such tax shall not, until March 31, 2035, be applicable to us or to any of our operations or to our shares, debentures or other obligations except insofar as such tax applies to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda or is payable by us in respect of real property owned or leased by us in Bermuda. Given the limited duration of the Bermuda Minister of Finance's assurance, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to any Bermuda tax after March 31, 2035.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. Federal income tax consequences to us of our activities and, subject to the limitations described above, to you as a holder of our common shares or Preference Shares.
The following discussion of U.S. Federal income tax matters is based on the Code, judicial decisions, administrative pronouncements, and existing and proposed regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address any U.S. state or local taxes. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. Federal, state and local and foreign income and other tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of our common shares or Preference Shares that may be applicable to you.
U.S. Taxation o f Our Operating Income
We have elected to treat a majority of our subsidiaries as disregarded entities for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. The entities that are considered disregarded entities for U.S. Federal income tax purposes should be treated as branches rather than corporations for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. Currently, no election has been filed to treat GasLog LNG Services Ltd., GasLog Services UK Ltd., GasLog Asia Pte. Ltd., GasLog Investments Ltd., GasLog Monaco S.A.M., GasLog Shipping Limited, GasLog Shipping Company Ltd., and Egypt LNG Shipping Ltd. as disregarded entities for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. As a result, these entities and GasLog Services U.S. Inc. will continue to be treated as corporations for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.
U.S. Taxation o f Shipping Income
Subject to the discussion of "effectively connected" income below, unless we are exempt from U.S. Federal income tax under the rules contained in Section 883 of the Code, we will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax under the rules of Section 887 of the Code, which would impose on us a
111

4% U.S. income tax in respect of our U.S. source gross transportation income (without the allowance for deductions).
For this purpose, U.S. source gross transportation income includes 50% of the shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends (but that does not both begin and end) in the United States. Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between non-U.S. ports is generally not subject to any U.S. income tax.
For this purpose, "shipping income" means income that is derived from:
(i) the use of ships;
(ii) the hiring or leasing of ships for use on a time, operating or bareboat charter basis;
(iii) the participation in a pool, partnership, strategic alliance, joint operating agreement or other joint venture we directly or indirectly own or participate in that generates such income; or
(iv) the performance of services directly related to those uses.
Under Section 883 of the Code and the regulations thereunder, we will be exempt from U.S. Federal income tax on our U.S. source gross transportation income if:
(i) we are organized in a foreign country (the "country of organization") that grants an "equivalent exemption" to corporations organized in the United States; and
(ii) either
(a) more than 50% of the value of our shares is owned, directly or indirectly, by individuals who are "residents" of our country of organization or of another foreign country that grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States (the "50% Ownership Test"), or
(b) our shares are "primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market" in our country of organization, in another country that grants an equivalent exemption to U.S. corporations, or in the United States (the "Publicly-Traded Test").
We are currently not entitled to this exemption under Section 883 for any tax year. As a result, we are subject to the 4% U.S. Federal income tax under Section 887 on our U.S. source gross transportation income (subject to the discussion of "effectively connected income" below). For 2016, the U.S. source gross transportation tax was $0.30 million.
Because we are unable to qualify for the exemption under Section 883, our U.S. source gross transportation income in future years that is considered to be "effectively connected" with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business is subject to the U.S. corporate income tax currently imposed at rates of up to 35% (net of applicable deductions). In addition, we may be subject to the 30% U.S. "branch profits" tax on earnings effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business, as determined after allowance for certain adjustments, and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the conduct of our U.S. trade or business.
Our U.S. source gross transportation income would be considered effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business only if:
(i) we had, or were considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning of U.S. source gross transportation income; and
(ii) substantially all of our U.S. source gross transportation income was attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a ship that followed a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the United States.
We believe that we will not meet these conditions because we will not have, or permit circumstances that would result in having, such a fixed place of business in the United States or any ship sailing to or from the United States on a regularly scheduled basis.
In addition, income attributable to transportation that both begins and ends in the United States is not subject to the tax rules described above. Such income is subject to either a 30% gross-basis
112

tax or to U.S. corporate income tax on net income at rates of up to 35% (and the branch profits tax discussed above). Although there can be no assurance, we do not expect to engage in transportation that produces shipping income of this type.
Taxation o f Gain on Sale o f Shipping Assets
Regardless of whether we qualify for the exemption under Section 883 of the Code, we will not be subject to U.S. income taxation with respect to gain realized on a sale of a ship, provided the sale is considered to occur outside of the United States (as determined under U.S. tax principles). In general, a sale of a ship will be considered to occur outside of the United States for this purpose if title to the ship (and risk of loss with respect to the ship) passes to the buyer outside of the United States. We expect that any sale of a ship will be so structured that it will be considered to occur outside of the United States.
Taxation o f United States Holders
You are a "U.S. holder" if you are a beneficial owner of our common shares or Preference Shares and you are a U.S. citizen or resident, a U.S. corporation (or other U.S. entity taxable as a corporation), an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. Federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a U.S. Federal income tax purposes.
If a partnership holds our common shares or Preference Shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our common shares or Preference Shares, you should consult your tax advisor.
Distributions on Our Common Shares and Preference Shares
Subject to the discussion of "passive foreign investment companies", or "PFICs", below, any distributions with respect to our common shares or Preference Shares that you receive from us generally will constitute dividends to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. tax principles). Distributions in excess of our earnings and profits will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of your tax basis in our common shares or Preference Shares (on a dollar-for-dollar basis) and thereafter as capital gain.
Because we are not a U.S. corporation, if you are a U.S. corporation (or a U.S. entity taxable as a corporation), you will not be entitled to claim a dividends-received deduction with respect to any distributions you receive from us.
Dividends paid with respect to our common shares or Preference Shares will generally be treated as "passive category income" for purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.
If you are an individual, trust or estate, dividends you receive from us should be treated as "qualified dividend income" taxed at a maximum preferential rate of 15% or 20%, depending on the income level of the individual, provided that:
(i) our common shares or Preference Shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States (such as the NYSE); (ii) we are not a PFIC for the tax year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding tax year (see the discussion below
under "--PFIC Status and Significant Tax Consequences"); (iii) you own our common shares or Preference Shares for more than 60 days in the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the date on
which the common shares or Preference Shares become ex-dividend; 113

(iv) you are not under an obligation to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property; and
(v) certain other conditions are met.
Special rules may apply to any "extraordinary dividend". Generally, an extraordinary dividend is a dividend in an amount that is equal to (or in excess of) 10% of your adjusted tax basis (or fair market value in certain circumstances) in a share of our common shares (5% in the case of Preference Shares). If we pay an extraordinary dividend on our common shares or Preference Shares that is treated as "qualified dividend income" and if you are an individual, estate or trust, then any loss derived by you from a subsequent sale or exchange of such common shares or Preference Shares will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of such dividend.
There is no assurance that dividends you receive from us will be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Dividends you receive from us that are not eligible for the preferential tax rates will be taxed at ordinary income rates.
Sale, Exchange on Other Disposition o f Common Shares and Preference Shares Provided that we are not a PFIC for any tax year, you generally will recognize taxable gain or loss upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by you from such sale, exchange or other disposition and your tax basis in such shares. Such gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if your holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other disposition. Such capital gain or loss will generally be treated as U.S. source income or loss, as applicable, for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Your ability to deduct capital losses against ordinary income is subject to limitations.
Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax Each U.S. holder who is an individual, estate or trust is generally subject to a 3.8% Medicare tax on the lesser of (i) such U.S. holder's "net investment income" for the relevant taxyear, and (ii) the excess of such U.S. holder's modified adjusted gross income for the tax year over a certain threshold (which in the case of individuals will be between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the individual's circumstances). For this purpose, net investment income generally includes dividends on and capital gains from the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares, subject to certain exceptions. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the applicability of the Medicare tax to your income and gains from your ownership of our common shares or Preference Shares.
PFIC Status and Significant Tax Consequences
In General
Special U.S. income tax rules apply to you if you hold shares in a non-U.S. corporation that is classified as a PFIC for U.S. income tax purposes. In general, under Section 1297 of the Code, we will be treated as a PFIC in any tax year in which, after applying certain look-through rules, either:
(i) at least 75% of our gross income including our proportionate share of the gross income of our vessel-owning subsidiaries for such tax year consists of passive income (e.g., dividends, interest, capital gains and rents derived other than in the active conduct of a rental business); or
(ii) at least 50% of the average value of our assets including our proportionate share of the assets of our vessel-owning subsidiaries during such tax year that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income.
Income we earn, or are deemed to earn, in connection with the performance of services will not constitute passive income. By contrast, rental income will generally constitute passive income (unless
114

we are treated under certain special rules as deriving our rental income in the active conduct of a trade or business).
There are legal uncertainties involved in determining whether the income derived from time chartering activities constitutes rental income or income derived from the performance of services. In Tidewater Inc. v. United States, 565 F.2d 299 (5th Cir. 2009), the Fifth Circuit held that income derived from certain time chartering activities should be treated as rental income rather than services income for purposes of a provision of the Code relating to foreign sales corporations. In recently published guidance, however, the IRS stated that it disagreed with the holding in Tidewater, and specified that time charters should be treated as service contracts. Since we have chartered all our ships to unrelated charterers on the basis of time charters and since we expect to continue to do so, we believe that we are not a PFIC. We have received an opinion from our counsel, Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, that (i) the income we receive from time chartering activities and assets engaged in generating such income should not be treated as passive income or assets, respectively, and (ii) for the tax year during which our initial public offering occurred and each tax year thereafter, we should not be a PFIC. This opinion is based and its accuracy is conditioned on representations, valuations and projections provided by us regarding the nature of our assets, income and charters to our counsel. While we believe these representations, valuations and projections to be accurate, the shipping market is volatile and no assurance can be given that they will continue to be accurate. Moreover, we have not sought, and we do not expect to seek, an IRS ruling on this matter. As a result, the IRS or a court could disagree with our position. No assurance can be given that this result will not occur. In addition, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to avoid, to the extent possible, being classified as a PFIC with respect to any tax year, we cannot assure you that the nature of our operations will not change in the future, or that we can avoid PFIC status in the future.
If we were to be treated as a PFIC for any tax year, you generally would be subject to one of three different U.S. Federal income tax regimes, as discussed below, depending on whether or not you make certain elections. Additionally, for each year during which you own our common shares or Preference Shares, we are a PFIC and the total value of all PFIC stock that you directly or indirectly own exceeds certain thresholds, you will be required to file IRS Form 8621 with your U.S. Federal income tax return to report your ownership of our common shares or Preference Shares.
Taxation o f U.S. Holders Making a Timely OEF Election
If we were a PFIC and if you make a timely election to treat us as a "Qualifying Electing Fund" for U.S. tax purposes (a "QEF Election"), you would be required to report each year your pro rata share of our ordinary earnings and our net capital gain for our tax year that ends with or within your tax year, regardless of whether we make any distributions to you. Such income inclusions would not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income (as discussed above under "Taxation of United States Holders--Distributions on Our Common Shares and Preference Shares"). Your adjusted tax basis in our common shares or Preference Shares would be increased to reflect such taxed but undistributed earnings and profits. Distributions of earnings and profits that had previously been taxed would result in a corresponding reduction in your adjusted tax basis in our common shares or Preference Shares and would not be taxed again once distributed. You generally would recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares. Even if you make a QEF Election for one of our tax years, if we were a PFIC for a prior tax year during which you held our common shares or Preference Shares and for which you did not make a timely QEF Election, you would also be subject to a more adverse regime described below under "--Taxation of U.S. Holders That Make No Election".
You would make a QEF Election by completing and filing IRS Form 8621 with your U.S. income tax return for the year for which the election is made in accordance with the relevant instructions. If we were to become aware that we were to be treated as a PFIC for any tax year, we would notify all U.S. holders of such treatment and would provide all necessary information to any
115

U.S. holder who requests such information in order to make the QEF Election described above with respect to us.
Taxation o f U.S. Holders Making a Timely "Mark-to-Market" Election Alternatively, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any tax year and, as we believe, our common shares or Preference Shares are treated as "marketable stock", you would be allowed to make a "mark-to-market" election with respect to our common shares or Preference Shares, provided you complete and file IRS Form 8621 with your U.S. income tax return for the year for which the election is made in accordance with the relevant instructions. If that election is made, you generally would include as ordinary income in each taxyear the excess, if any, of the fair market value of our common shares or Preference Shares at the end of the tax year over your adjusted tax basis in our common shares or Preference Shares. You also would be permitted an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of your adjusted tax basis in our common shares or Preference Shares over its fair market value at the end of the tax year (but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election). Your tax basis in our common shares or Preference Shares would be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amount. Gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the common shares or Preference Shares would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent that such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains previously included by you.
Taxation o f U.S. Holders That Make No Election Finally, if we were treated as a PFIC for any tax year and if you did not make either a QEF Election or a mark-to-market election for that year, you would be subject to special rules with respect to (i) any excess distribution (that is, the portion of any distributions received by you on our common shares or Preference Shares in a tax year in excess of 125% of the average annual distributions received by you in the three preceding tax years, or, if shorter, your holding period for our common shares or Preference Shares) and (ii) any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares. Under these special rules:
(i) the excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over your aggregate holding period for our common shares or Preference Shares; (ii) the amount allocated to the current tax year would be taxed as ordinary income; and (iii) the amount allocated to each of the other tax years would be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of
taxpayer for that year, and an interest charge for the deemed deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other tax year.
U.S. Federal Income Taxation o f Non-US. Holders
You are a "non-U.S. holder" if you are a beneficial owner of our common shares or Preference Shares (other than a partnership for U.S. tax purposes) and you are not a U.S. holder.
Distributions on Our Common Shares and Preference Shares You generally will not be subject to U.S. income or withholding taxes on a distribution received from us with respect to our common shares or Preference Shares, unless the income arising from such distribution is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If you are entitled to the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty with respect to that income, that income generally is taxable in the United States only if it is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by you in the United States.
116

Sale, Exchange on Other Disposition o f Our Common Shares and Preference Shares
You generally will not be subject to U.S. income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares, unless:
(i) the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If you are entitled to the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty with respect to that gain, that gain generally is taxable in the United States only if it is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by you in the United States; or
(ii) you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the tax year of disposition and certain other conditions are met.
Gain that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (or so treated) generally will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax (net of certain deductions) at regular U.S. Federal income tax rates. If you are a corporate non-U.S. holder, your earnings and profits that are attributable to the effectively connected income (subject to certain adjustments) may be subject to an additional U.S. branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable tax treaty).
United States Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
In General
In general, if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder, dividend payments (or other taxable distributions) made within the United States will be subject to information reporting requirements and backup withholding tax if you:
(i) fail to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number; (ii) are notified by the IRS that you have failed to report all interest or dividends required to be shown on your U.S. Federal income tax
returns; or (iii) in certain circumstances, fail to comply with applicable certification requirements.
If you are a non-U. S. holder, you may be required to establish your exemption from information reporting and backup withholding by certifying your status on IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI or W-8IMY, as applicable.
If you sell our common shares or Preference Shares to or through a U.S. office or broker, the payment of the sales proceeds is subject to both U.S. backup withholding and information reporting unless you certify that you are a non-U.S. person, under penalties of perjury, or you otherwise establish an exemption. If you sell our common shares or Preference Shares through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United States, then information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to that payment.
However, U.S. information reporting requirements (but not backup withholding) will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if that payment is made outside the United States, if you sell our common shares or Preference Shares through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is a U.S. person or has certain other connections with the United States.
Backup withholding tax is not an additional tax. Rather, you generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under backup withholding rules that exceed your income tax liability by accurately completing and timely filing a refund claim with the IRS.
Tax Return Disclosure
U.S. individuals that hold certain specified foreign financial assets (which include shares in a foreign corporation) are subject to U.S. return disclosure obligations (and related penalties for failure to disclose). Such U.S. individuals are required to file IRS Form 8938 with their U.S. Federal income tax returns. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisors concerning the filing of IRS Form 8938.

Based on our evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2016.
B. Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d- 15(f) of the Exchange Act and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our internal controls over financial reporting are designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (hi) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal controls over financial reporting, misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on the evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.
The Company's independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
C. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by Deloitte LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below. 119

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of GasLog Ltd.
Hamilton, Bermuda
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of GasLog Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Group") as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Group's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 of the Group and our report dated March 1, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

ITEM 16.F. CHANGE IN COMPANY'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT Not Applicable

ITEM 16.G. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Statement of Significant Differences Between Our Corporate Governance Practices and the New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Standards for U.S. Non-Controlled Issuers
Overview Pursuant to certain exceptions for foreign private issuers, we are not required to comply with certain of the corporate governance practices
followed by U.S. companies under the NYSE listing standards. However, pursuant to Section 303.A.11 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and the requirements of Form 20-F, we are required to state any significant ways in which our corporate
122

governance practices differ from the practices required by the NYSE for U.S. companies. We believe that our established practices in the area of corporate governance are in line with the spirit of the NYSE standards and provide adequate protection to our shareholders. The significant differences between our corporate governance practices and the NYSE standards applicable to listed U.S. companies are set forth below.
Independence o f Directors The NYSE rules do not require a listed company that is a foreign private issuer to have a board of directors that is comprised of a majority of
independent directors. Under Bermuda law, we are not required to have a board of directors comprised of a majority of directors meeting the independence standards described in the NYSE rules. Accordingly, our board of directors is not required to be and is not comprised of a majority of independent directors. Elowever, our board of directors has determined that half of our directors, specifically David P. Conner, William M. Friedrich, Dennis M. Elouston, Donald J. Kintzer, Anthony S. Papadimitriou and Philip Radziwill satisfy the independence standards established by the NYSE as applicable to us.
Corporate Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee Pursuant to NYSE Rules 303A.04 and 303A.05, the NYSE requires that a listed U.S. company have a nominating/corporate governance
committee and a compensation committee, each composed entirely of independent directors. As permitted under Bermuda law, we have one or more non-independent directors serving as committee members on our compensation committee and our corporate governance and nominating committee.
NYSE Rules 303A.02 and 303A.05 contain independence requirements for compensation committee directors and compensation committee advisers for U.S. listed companies, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Bermuda law does not have similar requirements therefore we may not adhere to these new requirements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of GasLog Ltd. Hamilton, Bermuda
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of GasLog Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Group") as of December 31, 2015 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of profit or loss, comprehensive income or loss, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Group's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of GasLog Ltd. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"). We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Group's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Group's internal control over financial reporting.

GasLog Ltd. and its Subsidiaries
Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 (All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share data)
1. Organization and Operations
GasLog Ltd. ("GasLog") was incorporated in Bermuda on July 16, 2003. GasLog and its subsidiaries (the "Group") are primarily engaged in the ownership, operation and management of vessels in the liquefied natural gas ("LNG") market, providing maritime services for the transportation of LNG on a worldwide basis and LNG vessel management services. The Group conducts its operations through its vessel-owning subsidiaries and through its vessel management services subsidiary. The Group's operations are carried out from offices in Piraeus, London, New York, Singapore and Monaco. The registered office of GasLog is Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda. GasLog's chairman, Peter G. Livanos, is GasLog's largest shareholder through his ownership of Ceres Shipping Ltd. ("Ceres Shipping"), which controls Blenheim Holdings Ltd. As of December 31, 2016, entities controlled by members of the Livanos family, including GasLog's chairman, are deemed to beneficially own approximately 40.2% of GasLog's issued and outstanding common shares. As a result of his ownership of GasLog's common shares, Mr. Livanos can effectively control the outcome of most matters on which GasLog's shareholders are entitled to vote.
On May 12, 2014, GasLog Partners LP ("GasLog Partners" or the "Partnership"), a subsidiary of GasLog, completed its initial public offering (the "GasLog Partners' IPO") with the sale and issuance of 9,660,000 common units (including 1,260,000 units in relation to the overallotment option exercised in full by the underwriters), resulting in net proceeds of $186,029 and representing a 48.2% ownership interest. Concurrently with the GasLog Partners' IPO, the Partnership acquired from GasLog a 100% ownership interest in GAS-three Ltd., GAS-four Ltd. and GAS-five Ltd., the entities that own the GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog Santiago and the GasLog Sydney, in exchange for (i) 162,358 common units and 9,822,358 subordinated units issued to GasLog representing a 49.8% ownership interest and all of the incentive distribution rights ("IDRs") that entitle GasLog to increasing percentages of the cash that the Partnership distributes in excess of $0.43125 per unit per quarter, (ii) 400,913 general partner units issued to GasLog Partners GP LLC (the "general partner"), a wholly owned subsidiary of GasLog, representing a 2.0% general partner interest and (iii) $65,695 of cash consideration paid directly to GasLog from the GasLog Partners' IPO proceeds.
On September 29, 2014, the Partnership acquired from GasLog 100% of the ownership interests in GAS-sixteen Ltd. and GAS-seventeen Ltd., the entities that own the 145,000 cbm LNG carriers, the Methane Rita Andrea and the Methane Jane Elizabeth, respectively, for an aggregate

purchase price of $328,000. On July 1, 2015, the Partnership acquired from GasLog 100% of the ownership interests in GAS-nineteen Ltd., GAStwenty Ltd. and GAS-twenty one Ltd., the entities that own three 145,000 cbm LNG carriers, the Methane Alison Victoria, the Methane Shirley Elisabeth and the Methane Heather Sally, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $483,000. On November 1, 2016, the Partnership acquired from GasLog 100% of the ownership interest in GAS-seven Ltd., the entity that owns a 155,000 cbm LNG carrier, the GasLog Seattle, for a purchase price of $189,000.
As of December 31, 2016, GasLog holds a 30.45% interest (including the 2% interest through general partner units) in GasLog Partners and, as a result of its ownership of the general partner and the fact that the general partner elects the majority of the Partnership's directors in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, GasLog has the ability to control the Partnership's affairs and policies. Consequently, GasLog Partners is consolidated in the Group's financial statements.

0 f o r newbuildings, expected delivery quarters are presented. (") O n February 24, 2016, GAS-twenty six Ltd. completed the sale and leaseback o f the Methane Julia Louise with a subsidiary o f Mitsui Co. Ltd. ("Mitsui"). Refer to Note 7.
('"> O n October 1, 2015, GasLog, Dynagas Ltd. ("Dynagas") and Golar LNG Ltd. ("Golar") signed a LNG carrier pooling agreement (the "LNG Carrier Pool" or "Pool Agreement") to market their vessels, which are currently operating in the LNG shipping spot market.
As o f December 31, 2016, the LNG Carrier Pool--named the "Cool Pool"--consists o f 18 modern, high quality and essentially equivalent vessels powered by fuel efficient tri-fuel diesel electric ("TFDE") propulsion technology. The three owners' vessels participation in the Cool Pool are as follows: Dynagas: three vessels; GasLog: five vessels; and Golar: ten vessels. Each vessel owner continues to be fully responsible for the manning and technical management o f their respective vessels. For the operation o f the Cool Pool, a Marshall Islands service company named "The Cool Pool Limited" or the "Pool Manager", was incorporated in September 2015 acting as an agent.
F-10

All entities in the Group have a December 31st year end. During 2016 the Group employed an average of 173 employees (2015: 158 and 2014: 142).
GasLog's common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker symbol "GLOG". GasLog's 8.75% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference Shares ("Preference Shares") are traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "GLOG PR A".
2. Significant Accounting Policies
Statement o f compliance The consolidated financial statements of GasLog and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (the "IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (the "IASB").
Basis o fpreparation and approval The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of derivative financial
instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.
Going concern In considering going concern management has reviewed the Group's future cash requirements, covenant compliance and earnings projections.
Management anticipates that the Group's primary sources of funds will be available cash, cash from operations and borrowings under existing and new loan agreements. The Group may also seek to raise additional equity. Management believes that these sources of funds will be sufficient for the Group to meet its liquidity needs and comply with its banking covenants for at least twelve months from the end of the reporting period and therefore it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
The financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars ("USD"), which is the functional currency of the Group's subsidiaries because their vessels operate in international shipping markets in which revenues and expenses are primarily settled in USD, and the Group's most significant assets and liabilities are paid for and settled in USD.
On March 1, 2017, the financial statements were authorized on behalf of GasLog's board of directors for issuance and filing. The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Basis o f consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of GasLog and entities controlled by GasLog (its subsidiaries). Control
is achieved where GasLog: · has power over the investee; · is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and · has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date
control is obtained and up to the date control ceases. Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation. The other investors in subsidiaries in which the Group has less than 100% interest hold a non-controlling interest in the net assets of these
subsidiaries. Non-controlling interest is stated at the non-controlling interest's proportion of the net assets of the subsidiaries where the Group has less than 100% interest. Subsequent to initial recognition the carrying amount of non-controlling interest is increased or decreased by the non-controlling interest's share of subsequent changes in the equity
F -ll

of such subsidiaries. Total comprehensive income is attributed to a non-controlling interest even if this results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Group.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognized as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the Group's interest in the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Investment in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are included in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Heldfo r Sale and Discontinued Operations. An impairment assessment of investments in associates is performed when there is an indication that the asset has been impaired or the impairment losses recognized in prior years no longer exist.
When the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the investment is reported at nil value and recognition of losses is discontinued except to the extent of the Group's commitment.
Investment in join t ventures
A joint arrangement is an arrangement where two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is established by a contractual arrangement that requires unanimous agreement on decisions made on relevant activities. Without the presence o f joint control, joint arrangements do not exist.
Under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and
F-12

obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure o f the joint arrangement. The arrangement is a joint operation when the contractual agreement provides rights to assets and obligations for liabilities for those parties sharing joint control. The joint arrangement is a joint venture when the agreement grants rights to the arrangement's net assets. The Cool Pool Limited is a joint venture. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (see Investment in associates above), after initially being recognized at cost in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Leases
Lease income from operating leases of vessels where the Group is a lessor is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The respective leased assets are included in the statement of financial position based on their nature under "Tangible fixed assets".
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease's inception at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease, if practicable, or else at the Group's incremental borrowing rate. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in current and non-current liabilities as finance lease liabilities. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the asset's useful life or over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group as lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Accounting fo r revenues and related operating expenses
The Group's revenues comprise revenues from time charters for the charter hire of its vessels, gross pool revenues, management fees, project supervision income and other income earned during the period in accordance with existing contracts.
Revenue from vessel management and vessel construction project supervision contracts is recognized when earned and when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and such a benefit can be measured reliably.
Pool revenues are recognized on a gross basis representing time charter revenues earned by GasLog vessels participating in the pool under charter agreements where GasLog contracts directly with charterers. Revenue is recognised on a monthly basis, when the vessel is made available and services are provided to the charterer during the period, the amount can be estimated reliably and collection of the related revenue is reasonably assured.
A time charter represents a contract entered into for the use of a vessel for a specific period of time and a specified daily charter hire rate. Time charter revenue is recognized as earned on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant time charter starting from the vessel's delivery to the charterer, except for the off-hire period, when a charter agreement exists, the vessel is made available and services are provided to the charterer and collection of the related revenue is reasonably assured. Unearned revenue includes cash received prior to the balance sheet date relating to services to be rendered after the balance sheet date. Accrued revenue represents income recognized in advance as a result of the straight-line revenue recognition in respect of charter agreements that provide for varying charter rates.
Time charter hires received in advance are classified as liabilities until the criteria for recognizing the revenue as earned are met.
F - 13

Under a time charter arrangement the vessel operating expenses such as management fees, crew wages, provisions and stores, technical maintenance and insurance expenses and broker's commissions are paid by the vessel owner, whereas voyage expenses such as bunkers, port expenses, agents' fees, and extra war risk insurance are paid by the charterer.
Accounting fo r voyage expenses and commissions Vessel operating costs and voyage expenses and commissions are expensed as incurred, with the exception of commissions, which are recognized
on a pro-rata basis over the duration of the period of the time charter. Bunkers' consumption represents mainly bunkers consumed during vessels unemployment and off-hire.
Furthermore, in relation to the vessels participating in the Cool Pool, voyage expenses and commissions include the net allocation from the pool which represents GasLog's share of the net revenues earned from the other pool participants' vessels less the other participants' share of the net revenues earned by GasLog's vessels included in the pool. Each participant's share of the net pool revenues is based on the number of pool points attributable to its vessels and the number of days such vessels participated in the pool.
Financial income and costs Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established. Interest expense, other borrowing costs and realized loss on interest rate swaps are recognized on an accrual basis.
Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than the USD are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of
each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are retranslated into USD at the rates prevailing at that date. All resulting exchange differences are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
Deferredfinancing costsfo r undrawn facilities Commitment, arrangement, structuring, legal and agency fees incurred for obtaining new loans or refinancing existing facilities are recorded as
deferred loan issuance costs and classified contra to debt, while the fees incurred for the undrawn facilities are classified under non-current assets in the statement of financial position and are reclassified contra to debt on the drawdown dates.
Deferred financing costs are deferred and amortized to financial costs over the term of the relevant loan, using the effective interest method. When the relevant loan is terminated or extinguished, the unamortized loan fees are written-off in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Vessels under construction Vessels under construction are presented at cost less identified impairment losses, if any. Costs include shipyard installment payments and other
vessel costs incurred during the construction period that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of the vessels. Upon completion of the construction, the vessels are presented on the statement of financial position in accordance with the "Tangible fixed
assets: Property, plant and equipment" policy as described below.
Tangible fixed assets: Property, plant and equipment Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. The initial cost of an asset comprises
its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition. F-14

The cost of a LNG vessel is split into two components, a "vessel component" and a "dry-docking component". Depreciation for the vessel component is calculated on a straight-line basis, after taking into account the estimated residual values, over the estimated useful life of this major component of the vessels. Residual values are based on management's estimation about the amount that the Group would currently obtain from disposal of its vessels, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the vessels were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of their useful life.

The LNG vessels are required to undergo a dry-docking overhaul every five years to restore their service potential and to meet their classification requirements that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating. The dry-docking component is estimated at the time of a vessel's delivery from the shipyard or acquisition from the previous owner and is measured based on the estimated cost of the first dry-docking subsequent to its acquisition, based on the Group's historical experience with similar types of vessels. For subsequent dry-dockings actual costs are capitalized when incurred. The dry-docking component is depreciated over the period of five years in case of new vessels, and until the next dry-docking for secondhand vessels.

Costs that will be capitalized as part of the future dry-dockings will include a variety of costs incurred directly attributable to the dry-dock and costs incurred to meet classification and regulatory requirements, as well as expenses related to the dock preparation and port expenses at the dry-dock shipyard, dry-docking shipyard expenses, expenses related to hull, external surfaces and decks, and expenses related to machinery and engines of the vessel, as well as expenses related to the testing and correction of findings related to safety equipment on board. Dry-docking costs do not include vessel operating expenses such as replacement parts, crew expenses, provisions, lubricants consumption, insurance, management fees or management costs during the dry-docking period. Expenses related to regular maintenance and repairs of vessels are expensed as incurred, even if such maintenance and repair occurs during the same time period as dry-docking.

The expected useful lives of all long-lived assets are as follows:
Vessel____________________________________________________________________________________
LNG vessel component Dry-docking component Furniture, computer, software and other office equipment Leasehold improvements

35 years 5 years 3-5 years 12 years (or remaining term of the lease)

Management estimates the useful life of its vessels to be 35 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard. Secondhand vessels are depreciated from the date of their acquisition through their remaining estimated useful life.

The useful lives of all assets and the depreciation method are reviewed annually to ensure that the method and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from items of property, plant and equipment. The residual value is also reviewed at each financial period-end. If expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for prospectively in profit or loss in the period of the change and future periods.

Ordinary maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred.

When assets are sold, they are derecognized and any gain or loss resulting from their disposal is included in profit or loss.

Impairment o f tangible fixed assets, vessels under construction and vessel held underfinance lease
All assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less cost of disposal and "value in use". The fair value less cost of disposal is the amount obtainable from the sale of an
F-15

asset in an arm's length transaction less the costs of disposal, while "value in use" is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if it is not possible, for the cash-generating unit. Each vessel is considered to be a separate cash-generating unit. The fair values of the vessels are estimated from market-based evidence by appraisal that is normally undertaken by professionally qualified brokers.
Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Inventories
Inventories represent lubricants on board the vessel and in the event of vessels unemployment the bunkers on board the vessel. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost calculated on a first in, first out basis, and net realizable value.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
· Cash and cash equivalents
Cash represents cash on hand and deposits with banks which are repayable on demand. Cash equivalents represent short-term, highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
· Restricted cash
Restricted cash comprises cash held that is not available for use by the Group including cash held in blocked accounts in order to comply with the covenants under the Group's credit facilities.
· Short-term investments
Short-term investments represent short-term, highly liquid time deposits placed with financial institutions which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash with original maturities of more than three months but less than 12 months at the time of purchase that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
· Trade receivables
Trade receivables are carried at the amount expected to be received from the third party to settle the obligation. Bad debts are written off during the period in which they are identified.
F-16

An estimate is made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts at each reporting date.
· Borrowings
Borrowings are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement of the borrowings is recognized in the statement of profit or loss over the term of the borrowings.
· Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, including interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value, and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the consolidated statement of profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. Derivatives are presented as assets when their valuation is favorable to the Group and as liabilities when unfavorable to the Group.
The Group's criteria for classifying a derivative instrument in a hedging relationship include: (1) the hedging instrument is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk; (2) the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured; (3) there is adequate documentation of the hedging relationships at the inception of the hedge; and (4) for cash flow hedges, the forecasted transaction that is the hedged item in the hedging relationship must be considered highly probable.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line item as the recognized hedged item. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group terminates the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any gain or loss accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the hedged item affects the consolidated statement of profit or loss. When a forecast transaction designated as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recycled immediately to the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
· Finance lease liabilities
Finance lease liabilities are initially measured at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments--discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease, if practicable, or else at the entity's incremental borrowing rate--and subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. Finance charges in respect of finance leases are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss under "Financial costs".
Segment Information
The information provided to the Group's chief operating decision maker (the "CODM") being the Chief Executive Officer, to review the Group's operating results and allocate resources, is on a
F-17

consolidated basis for a single reportable segment. Furthermore, when the Group charters a vessel to a charterer, the charterer is free to trade the vessel worldwide and, as a result, the disclosure of geographic information is impracticable.
Share-based compensation
Share-based compensation to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments on the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of share-based transactions are set out in Note 21.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based compensation is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the share-based compensation reserve.
Critical accounting judgments and key sources o f estimation uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Group's management evaluates whether estimates should be made on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods management considers reasonable in the particular circumstances. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets or liabilities in the future. Critical accounting judgments are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.
Critical accounting judgments:
In the process of applying GasLog's accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, apart from those involving estimations, that had the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
Classification o f the non-controlling interests: The non-controlling interests in the Partnership comprise the portion of the Partnership's common units that are not directly or indirectly held by GasLog (24,410,000 units as of December 31, 2016). Under the terms of the partnership agreement, the Partnership is required to distribute 100% of available cash (as defined in the partnership agreement) with respect to each quarter within 45 days of the end of the quarter to the partners. Available cash can be summarized as cash and cash equivalents less an amount equal to cash reserves established by the Partnership's board of directors to (i) provide for the proper conduct of the business of the Partnership (including reserves for future capital expenditures and for anticipated future credit needs of the Partnership) subsequent to such quarter, (ii) comply with applicable law or any loan agreement, security agreement, mortgage, debt instrument or other agreement or obligation to which any Partnership member is a party or by which it is bound or its assets are subject and/or (hi) provide funds for certain distributions relating to future periods.
In reaching a judgment as to whether the non-controlling interests in the Partnership should be classified as liabilities or equity interests, management has considered the wide discretion of the board of directors of the Partnership to determine whether any portion of the amount of cash available to the Partnership constitutes available cash and that it is possible that there could be no available cash. In the event that there is no available cash, as determined by the Partnership's board of directors, the Partnership does not have a contractual obligation to make a distribution.
F-18

Accordingly, management has concluded that the non-controlling interests do not represent a contractual obligation on the Partnership to deliver cash and therefore should be classified as equity within the financial statements.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty are as follows:
Vessel lives and residual value: Vessels are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the vessel carrying amount relate to the estimation of the useful life of a LNG vessel of 35 years and the residual value. An increase in the estimated useful life of a vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and an increase in the estimated useful life of a vessel would also extend the annual depreciation charge into later periods. A decrease in the useful life of a vessel or its residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge.
Management estimated residual value of its vessels to be equal to the product of its lightweight tonnage ("LWT") and an estimated scrap rate per LWT. Effective December 31, 2016, following management's annual reassessment, the estimated scrap rate per LWT was decreased. This change in estimate is expected to increase the future annual depreciation by $482. The estimated residual value of the ships may not represent the fair market value at any one time partly because market prices of scrap values tend to fluctuate. Management might revise its estimate of the residual values of the ships in the future in response to changing market conditions.
If regulations place significant limitations on the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, the vessel's useful life will be adjusted to end at the date such regulations become effective.
Vessel cost: When determining vessel cost, the Group recognizes the installment payments paid to the shipyard or the acquisition price paid to the seller for secondhand vessels along with any directly attributable costs of bringing the vessels to their working condition. Directly attributable costs incurred during the vessel construction periods consist of commissions, on-site supervision costs, costs for sea trials, certain critical initial spare parts and equipment, costs directly incurred for negotiating the construction contracts, initial lubricants and other vessel delivery expenses. Any vendor discounts are deducted from the vessel cost. Subsequent expenditures for conversions and major improvements are also capitalized when the recognition criteria are met.
The vessel cost component is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel, based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value. The Group estimates the useful lives of its vessels to be 35 years from the date of delivery from the shipyard, which management believes is within industry standards and represents the most reasonable useful life for each of the vessels.
The Group must periodically dry-dock each of the vessels for inspection, repairs and any modifications. At the time of delivery of a ship from the shipyard, the Group estimates the dry-docking component of the cost of the vessel, representing estimated costs to be incurred during the first dry-docking at the dry-dock yard for a special survey and parts and supplies used in making required major repairs that meet the recognition criteria, based on the Group's historical experience with similar types of vessels. For subsequent dry-dockings actual costs are capitalized when incurred. Costs that will be capitalized as part of the future dry-dockings will include a variety of costs incurred directly attributable to the dry-docking and costs incurred to meet classification and regulatory requirements, as well as expenses related to the dock preparation and port expenses at the dry-dock shipyard, general shipyard expenses, expenses related to hull, external surfaces and decks, expenses related to machinery and engines of the vessel, as well as expenses related to the testing and correction of findings related to safety equipment on board. Dry-docking costs do not include vessel operating expenses such as replacement parts, crew expenses, provisions, lubricants consumption, insurance, management fees or management costs during the dry-docking period. Expenses related to regular maintenance and repairs of the vessels are expensed as incurred, even if such maintenance and repair occurs during the same time period as the dry-docking.
F-19

Ordinary maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred.
The Group recognizes dry-docking costs as a separate component of the vessel's carrying amount and amortizes the dry-docking cost on a straight-line basis over the estimated period until the next dry-docking. If the vessel is disposed of before the next dry-docking, the remaining balance of the dry-dock is written-off and forms part of the gain or loss recognized upon disposal of vessels in the period of disposal. The Group expects that its vessels will be required to be dry-docked in approximately 60 months after their delivery from the shipyard, and thereafter every 60 months will be required to undergo special or intermediate surveys and dry-docking for major repairs and maintenance that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating. The Group amortizes its estimated dry-docking expenses for the first special survey over five years, in case of new vessels, and until the next dry-docking for secondhand vessels unless the Group intends to dry-dock the vessels earlier as circumstances arise.
Impairment o f vessels: The Group evaluates the carrying amounts of its vessels to determine whether there is any indication that those vessels have suffered an impairment loss by considering both internal and external sources of information. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of vessels is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. The projection of cash flows related to vessels is complex and requires management to make various estimates including future charter rates, vessel operating expenses and the discount rate. All of these items have been historically volatile. In assessing the fair value less cost to sell of the vessel, the Group obtains vessel valuations from independent and internationally recognized ship brokers on an annual basis or when there is an indication that an asset or assets may be impaired. If an indication of impairment is identified, the need for recognizing an impairment loss is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the vessel to the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use.
The Group's estimates of basic market value assume that the vessels are all in seaworthy condition without a need for repair and if inspected would be certified in class without notations of any kind. The Group's estimates are based on approximate market values for its vessels that have been received from shipbrokers, which are also commonly used and accepted by the Group's lenders for determining compliance with the relevant covenants in its credit facilities. Vessel values can be highly volatile, so that the estimates may not be indicative of the current or future basic market value of the Group's vessels or prices that could be achieved if it were to sell them.
As of December 31, 2016, the carrying amounts of ten vessels were higher than the estimated charter free market value and the Group concluded that events and circumstances triggered the existence of potential impairment of these vessels. As a result, the Group performed the impairment assessment of these vessels by comparing the discounted projected net operating cash flows for these vessels to their carrying values. The significant factors and assumptions the Group used in its discounted projected net operating cash flow analysis included, among others, operating revenues, offhire revenues, dry-docking costs, operating expenses, management fees estimates, residual values and the discount factor. Revenue assumptions were based on contracted time charter rates up to the end of life of the current contract of each vessel as well as the estimated average time charter rates for the remaining life of the vessel after the completion of its current contract. The estimated daily time charter rates used for non-contracted revenue days are based on a combination of (i) recent charter market rates, (ii) conditions existing in the LNG market as of December 31, 2016, (iii) historical average time charter rates, based on publications by independent third party maritime research services, and (iv) estimated future time charter rates, based on publications by independent third party maritime research services that provide such forecasts. Recognizing that the LNG industry is cyclical and subject to significant volatility based on factors beyond the Group's control, management believes the use of revenue estimates, based on the combination of factors (i) to (iv)
F-20

above, to be reasonable as of the reporting date. In addition, the Group used an annual operating expenses escalation factor and estimates of scheduled and unscheduled off-hire revenues based on historical experience. All estimates used and assumptions made were in accordance with the Group's internal budgets and historical experience of the shipping industry. The value in use for the ten vessels calculated as per above was higher than the carrying amount of these vessels and consequently, no impairment loss was recognized.
Measurement o f share-based compensation: Share-based compensation to executives and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments on the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of share-based transactions are set out in Note 21.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based compensation is expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the share-based compensation reserve.
Impairment o f goodwill: The Group reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to the cash-generating unit representing the management company, GasLog LNG Services Ltd., which was acquired by the Group in 2005.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit(s) and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Details of the impairment analysis are set out in Note 3. No impairment loss was recognized for any of the periods presented.
Fair value o f derivativefinancial instruments: The Group's risk management policies permit the use of derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
A substantial majority of the Group's derivative instruments activity relates to the use of interest rate swaps. The fair value of the Group's interest rate swap agreements is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit worthiness of both the Group and the swap counterparties. The estimated amount is the present value of estimated future cash flows, being equal to the difference between the benchmark interest rate and the fixed rate in the interest rate swap agreement, multiplied by the notional principal amount of the interest rate swap agreement at each interest reset date.
The fair value of the Group's interest and currency swap agreements at the end of each period are most significantly affected by the interest rate implied by market-observable data such as the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") yield curve, and forward foreign exchange rates. While the fair value of the Group's interest and currency swap agreements are typically more sensitive to changes in short-term rates, significant changes in the long-term benchmark interest and foreign exchange rates also materially impact interest and currency swap agreements.
The fair value of the Group's interest rate and currency swap agreements are also affected by changes in its specific credit risk and counterparties' risk included in the discount factor. The estimate of the Group's credit risk is based on the credit rating of other companies in the LNG industry where publicly available, the rating of the global transportation industry where the shipping industry is included and the feedback that the Group receives from its lenders as part of the margin setting for the new loan agreements. The counterparties' credit risk is estimated either by using the
F-21

credit default swap rates obtained from public information or, if not available, by using the credit rating of the counterparties.
The LIBOR yield curve and the Group's specific credit risk are expected to vary over the life of the interest rate swap agreements. The larger the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements outstanding and the longer the remaining duration of the interest rate swap agreements, the larger the impact of any variability in these factors will be on the fair value of the Group's interest rate swaps. The Group economically hedges the interest rate exposure on a significant amount of its long-term debt and for long durations. As such, the Group has historically experienced, and expects to continue to experience, material variations in the period-to-period fair value of its derivative instruments.
Although the Group measures the fair value of its derivative instruments utilizing the inputs and assumptions described above, if it were to terminate the agreements at the reporting date, the amount the Group would pay or receive to terminate the derivative instruments may differ from the estimate of fair value. If the estimated fair value differs from the actual termination amount, an adjustment to the carrying amount of the applicable derivative asset or liability would be recognized in profit or loss for the current period. Such adjustments could be material. See Note 25 for the effects on the change in fair value of its derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of profit or loss.
Adoption o f new and revised IFRS
Standards and amendments in issue not yet adopted
At the date of authorization of these financial statements, the following standards and amendments relevant to the Group were in issue but not yet effective:
In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which applies to all contracts with customers: the main exceptions are leases, financial instruments and insurance contracts. IFRS 15 specifies how and when an IFRS reporter will recognize revenue as well as requiring such entities to provide users of financial statements with more informative, relevant disclosures. The standard supersedes IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and a number of revenue-related interpretations. The standard was amended in September 2015 to delay the effective date to annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 but early adoption is permitted. In addition, the standard was further amended in April 2016 to clarify the guidance on identifying performance obligations, accounting for licences of intellectual property and the principal versus agent assessment (gross versus net revenue presentation), as well as to give new and amended illustrative examples and practical expedients. Management anticipates that the implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements since the vast majority of revenues are generated by long-term contracts with charterers.
In July 2014, the IASB issued the complete version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. IFRS 9 specifies how an entity should classify and measure financial assets and financial liabilities. The new standard requires all financial assets to be subsequently measured at amortized cost or fair value depending on the business model of the legal entity in relation to the management of the financial assets and the contractual cash flows of the financial assets. The standard also requires a financial liability to be classified as either at fair value through profit or loss or at amortized cost. In addition, a new hedge accounting model was introduced, that is designed to be more closely aligned with how entities undertake risk management activities when hedging financial and non-financial risk exposures. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 but early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract, i.e. the customer ("lessee") and the supplier ("lessor"). IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases by
F-22

lessees as either operating leases or finance leases and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Applying that model, a lessee is required to recognise: (a) assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value; and (b) depreciation of lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the statement of profit or loss. Lessors continue to classify their leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently. IFRS 16 supersedes the previous leases Standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related Interpretations. The standard is effective from January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted only with concurrent adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 7 Statement o f Cash Flows introducing an additional disclosure that will enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. The amendments are part of the IASB's Disclosure Initiative, which continues to explore how financial statement disclosure can be improved. Entities will be required to disclose changes arising from cash flows, such as drawdowns and repayments of borrowings and also non-cash changes, such as acquisitions, disposals and unrealised exchange differences. Even though a specific format is not mandated, where a reconciliation is used the disclosure should provide sufficient information to link items included in the reconciliation to the statement of financial position and statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017, with earlier application being permitted. Entities are not required to present comparative information for preceding periods. Management anticipates that these amendments will only have a disclosure impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment clarifying how to account for certain types of share-based payment transactions. The amendments clarify the measurement basis for cash-settled, share-based payments and the accounting for modifications that change an award from cash-settled to equity-settled. An exception to the principles in IFRS 2 is also introduced that will require an award to be treated as if it was wholly equity-settled, where an employer is obliged to withhold an amount for the employee's tax obligation associated with a share-based payment and pay that amount to the tax authority. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
The impact of all other IFRS standards and amendments issued but not yet adopted is not expected to be material.3
3. Goodwill
Goodwill resulted from the acquisition in 2005 of Ceres LNG Services Ltd., the vessel management company, which represents a cash generating unit. On September 30, 2011, Ceres LNG Services Ltd. was renamed "GasLog LNG Services Ltd." As of December 31, 2016, the Group assessed the recoverable amount of goodwill, and concluded that goodwill associated with the Group's vessel management company was not impaired. The recoverable amount of the vessel management operations is determined based on a value-in-use calculation which uses cash flow to be generated based on financial budget for the year ending December 31, 2017, approved by management.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations (2017 and beyond) are as follows:
(i) Average inflation of 1.0% per annum;
(ii) A pre-tax discount rate of 12.8% per annum;
(in) Annual growth rate of 1.0%; and
(iv) 1 Euro = USD 1.15.
F-23

Growth is based on the number of vessels expected to be under management based on the shipbuilding contracts in place at the end of the year and the long-term strategy of the Group. Management believes that any reasonably possible further change in the key assumptions on which recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
4. Equity Transactions
On January 22, 2014, GasLog completed a follow-on public offering of 10,925,000 common shares, including 1,425,000 common shares issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. The public offering price was $15.75 per share. GasLog also sold 2,317,460 common shares at the public offering price in a private placement to certain of its directors and officers and one of its major shareholders. The net proceeds from the public offering and the concurrent private placement, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were $199,016.
On April 16, 2014, GasLog completed a follow-on public offering of 4,887,500 common shares, including 637,500 common shares issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. The public offering price was $23.75 per share. The net proceeds from the public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses, were approximately $109,940.
On May 12, 2014, the Partnership completed its IPO with the sale and issuance of 9,660,000 common units, resulting in net proceeds of $186,029 and representing a 48.2% ownership interest (Note 1). GasLog Partners used the net IPO proceeds to (a) pay $65,695 directly to GasLog as cash consideration for the contribution of GAS-three Ltd., GAS-four Ltd. and GAS-five Ltd., (b) prepay $82,634 of debt plus accrued interest of $416 and (c) make a payment of $2,285 (including $271 accrued interest) to settle the mark-to-market loss on termination of one interest rate swap and reduction of a second interest rate swap in connection with the aforementioned debt prepayment. The balance of $35,000 was retained by the Partnership for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the GasLog Partners' IPO of $186,029 were received in cash and have been allocated to non-controlling interest.
On September 29, 2014, GasLog Partners completed a follow-on public offering of 4,500,000 common units at a public offering price of $31.00 per unit. The net proceeds from this offering after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses were $133,007 and have been allocated to non-controlling interest.
On April 7, 2015, GasLog completed a public offering of 4,600,000 Preference Shares (including 600,000 shares issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional Preference Shares), par value $0.01 per share, liquidation preference $25.00 per share, which priced at $25.00 per share. The net proceeds from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses were $110,653.
On June 26, 2015, GasLog Partners completed a public offering of 7,500,000 common units at a public offering price of $23.90 per unit.

On August 5, 2016, GasLog Partners completed a public offering of 2,750,000 common units at a public offering price of $19.50 per unit. The net proceeds from this offering after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses, were $52,299. In connection with the offering, the Partnership issued 56,122 general partner units to its general partner in order for GasLog to retain its 2.0%.

Vessels with an aggregate carrying amount of $3,877,889 as of December 31, 2016 (December 31, 2015: $3,390,724) have been pledged as collateral under the terms of the Group's loan agreements (Note 13).
On March 31, 2015, GasLog acquired two 170,000 cbm tri-fuel diesel electric LNG carriers from a subsidiary of BG Group pic ("BG Group") for an aggregate cost of $460,000 and chartered those vessels back to Methane Services Limited ("MSL") for periods of 9 and 11 years respectively, with further options by the charterer to extend the term of the time charter for each vessel by either three or five years. The vessels acquired are the 2010-built Methane Becki Anne and Methane Julia Louise. GasLog supervised their construction and has technically managed both ships since their delivery to BG Group in 2010. They have tri-fuel diesel electric propulsion and on-board reliquefaction plants, which enable the vessels to operate on gas at a wider range of speed more efficiently.
On February 24, 2016, GAS-twenty six Ltd. completed the sale and leaseback of the Methane Julia Louise with a subsidiary of Mitsui. Refer to Note 7.
The acquisition of the aforementioned vessels was treated as an asset acquisition based on the absence of processes attached to the inputs. In addition, management considered that the charter party agreements entered into approximate market rates and has concluded that the contracted daily charter rate approximates the fair value on the transaction completion dates, taking into account
F-27

that the rates agreed with BG Group were in arms' length negotiations and management's understanding of the market. Considering the above, the purchase price was allocated in total to vessel cost.

Vessels under construction

In 2011, GAS-ten Ltd. entered into a shipbuilding contract with Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. ("Samsung") for the construction of a LNG Carrier (155,000 cubic meters). The CasLog Salem was delivered on April 30, 2015.

In January 2013, GAS-eleven Ltd. and GAS-twelve Ltd. entered into shipbuilding contracts with Samsung for the construction of two LNG carriers (174,000 cubic meters each). The first vessel, the CasLog Greece, was delivered on March 29, 2016, while the second vessel, the CasLog Glasgow, was delivered on June 30, 2016.

In August 2013, GAS-thirteen Ltd. and GAS-fourteen Ltd. entered into shipbuilding contracts with Samsung for the construction of two LNG carriers (174,000 cubic meters each). The first vessel, the CasLog Geneva, was delivered on September 30, 2016, while the second vessel, the CasLog Gibraltar, was delivered on October 31, 2016.

In May 2014, GAS-twenty two Ltd. and GAS-twenty three Ltd. entered into shipbuilding contracts with Samsung for the construction of two LNG carriers (174,000 cubic meters each). The vessels are expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2018 and 2019, respectively.

In June 2014, GAS-twenty four Ltd. and GAS-twenty five Ltd. entered into shipbuilding contracts with Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. ("Hyundai") for the construction of two LNG carriers (174,000 cubic meters each). The vessels are expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2018.

In September 2016, GAS-twenty eight Ltd. entered into a shipbuilding contract with Samsung for the construction of one LNG carrier (180,000 cubic meters). The vessel is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2019.

Vessels under construction represent scheduled advance payments to the shipyards as well as certain capitalized expenditures. As of December 31, 2016, the Group has paid to the shipyard $91,375 for the vessels that are under construction and expects to pay the remaining installments as they come due upon each vessel's keel laying, launching and delivery (Note 22(b)).

The vessels under construction costs as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 are comprised of:
Progress shipyard installments Onsite supervision costs Critical spare parts, equipment and other vessel delivery expenses Total

7. Sale and Leaseback
On February 24, 2016, GasLog's subsidiary, GAS-twenty six Ltd., completed the sale and leaseback of the Methane Julia Louise with a subsidiary of Mitsui. Mitsui has the right to on-sell and lease back the vessel. The vessel was sold to Mitsui for a cash consideration of $217,000. GasLog leased back the vessel under a bareboat charter from Mitsui for a period of up to 20 years. GasLog has the option to repurchase the vessel on pre-agreed terms no earlier than the end of year ten and no later than the end of year 17 of the bareboat charter. The bareboat hire is fixed and GasLog had a holiday period for the first 210 days, which expired on September 21, 2016. This leaseback meets the definition of a finance lease under IFRS.

On October 23, 2014, GasLog received a waiver letter from DNB Bank ASA, acting as agent of the loan facility of GAS-eight Ltd., GAS-nine Ltd. and GAS-ten Ltd., relating to the failure of GAS-nine Ltd. and GAS-ten Ltd. to secure relevant charter parties as required by the aforementioned loan facility. The waiver permitted (subject to proper documentation being executed) the drawdown of the relevant tranches notwithstanding that the charter arrangements had not been secured. Subsequent to the waiver letter, on December 2, 2014 a supplemental deed was signed with the lenders which among other amendments to the Principal Agreement requested for an amount of $21,000 per vessel to be maintained in blocked accounts until the time that an acceptable charter party agreement had been entered into after the delivery dates of the respective vessels.

On November 12, 2014, GAS-three Ltd., GAS-four Ltd., GAS-five Ltd., GAS-sixteen Ltd., GAS-seventeen Ltd., GasLog Partners and GasLog Partners Holdings LLC entered in a loan agreement with Citibank acting as security agent and trustee for and on behalf of the other finance parties mentioned above, for a credit facility for up to $450,000 (the "GasLog Partners' Credit Facility") for the purpose of refinancing in full the existing debt facilities. The agreement provides for a single tranche that was drawn on November 18, 2014. The credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin. The aforementioned refinancing was considered an extinguishment of the existing debt facilities. Consequently, the unamortized loan fees of $9,019 were written off to profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2014.
On May 8, 2015, the Partnership entered into a supplemental deed relating to its Citibank N.A. loan facility, in which the lenders unanimously approved such changes to the facility agreement as were required to reflect the changes to the charters of three vessels agreed with BG Group on April 21, 2015. As the aforementioned deed did not result in substantially different terms to the original loan agreement, the amendments were considered a modification of the existing terms. Consequently, the additional fees of $515 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 have been accounted for as deferred financing fees to be amortized over the remaining term of the loan facility with the effective interest method. The balance outstanding as of December 31, 2016 is $405,000 (December 31, 2015: $427,500) and is repayable in 12 equal quarterly installments of $5,625 each and a final balloon payment of $337,500 payable concurrently with the last quarterly installment in November 2019.

On July 25, 2016, the available amount of $950,000 under the term loan facility and $11,641 under the revolving credit facility were drawn to refinance the aggregate existing indebtedness of $959,899 of GAS-one Ltd., GAS-two Ltd., GAS-six Ltd., GAS-seven Ltd., GAS-eight Ltd., GAS-nine Ltd., GAS-ten Ltd. and GAS-fifteen Ltd. Amounts drawn bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin. The aforementioned refinancing was considered an extinguishment of the existing debt facilities. Consequently, the unamortized loan fees of $18,215 were written off to profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2016. The balance outstanding as of December 31, 2016 of $950,000 under the term loan facility shall be repaid in nine semi-annual installments of $29,167 each and a balloon repayment of $687,500 five years after drawdown. The outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2016 was $11,641, while the available amount of $88,359 can be drawn and repaid at any time until January 2021 and July 2021, respectively. The aforementioned vessel-owning entities are also required to maintain at all times minimum liquidity of $1,500 and are in compliance as of December 31, 2016.
Securities covenants and guarantees
The obligations under the aforementioned facilities, with the exception of the junior tranche loan facility under the Five Vessel Refinancing, are secured by a first priority mortgage over the vessels, a pledge of the share capital of the respective vessel owning companies and a first priority assignment of earnings related to the vessels (excluding the vessels participating in the Cool Pool), including charter revenue, management revenue and any insurance and requisition compensation. In relation to the junior tranche loan facility drawn under the Five Vessel Refinancing, this is secured by second priority mortgage and assignments. Obligations under the GasLog Partners Credit Facility are facilities guaranteed by the Partnership and GasLog Partners Holdings LLC, obligations under the Five Vessel Refinancing are guaranteed by GasLog, by the Partnership and GasLog Partners Holdings LLC for up to the value of the commitments relating to the Methane Alison Victoria, Methane Shirley Elisabeth and Methane Heather Sally and by GasLog Carriers Ltd. for up to the value of the commitments on the remaining vessels, obligations under the Legacy Facility Refinancing are guaranteed by GasLog, by the Partnership and GasLog Partners Holdings LLC for up to the value of the commitments relating to the GasLog Seattle and by GasLog Carriers Ltd. for up to the value of the commitments on the remaining vessels, while obligations under the fourth facility are guaranteed by GasLog and GasLog Carriers Ltd. The facilities include customary respective covenants, and among other restrictions the facilities include a fair market value covenant
F-39

pursuant to which the majority lenders may request additional security under the facilities if the aggregate fair market value of the collateral vessels (without taking into account any charter arrangements) were to fall below 120% of the aggregate outstanding principal balance (with respect to the debt financing agreement entered into in October 2015, below 115% of the aggregate outstanding principal balance for the first two years after each drawdown and below 120% at any time thereafter). The Group was in compliance with the required minimum security coverage as of December 31, 2016.
Senior Unsecured Notes
On June 27, 2013, GasLog issued a senior unsecured bond of NOK 500,000 (or $83,206 based on the exchange rate on June 27, 2013) that will mature on June 27, 2018. On May 2, 2014, GasLog closed a follow-on issue of the Norwegian bond of NOK 500,000 (or $83,612 based on the exchange rate on closing date) at a premium of $4,180 (based on the exchange rate on closing date). On June 27, 2016, GasLog repurchased and cancelled NOK 588,000 (or $70,677) of the outstanding bonds at a price of 103.0% of par value, resulting in a loss of $2,120. Additionally, as a result of the repurchase, the unamortized bond fees and premium of $1,836 were written off to profit or loss for the year ended December 31, 2016. The total outstanding balance of the Norwegian bond, after the follow-on issue and the partial repurchase (the "2018 Bond Agreement") amounts to NOK 412,000.
The bond under the 2018 Bond Agreement bears interest at NIBOR plus margin. Interest payments shall be made in arrears on a quarterly basis. GasLog may redeem it in whole or in part as follows (Call Option): (a) with settlement date at any time from June 27, 2016 to but not including June 27, 2017 at 105.0% of par plus accrued interest on redeemed amount, (b) with settlement date at any time from June 27, 2017 to but not including December 27, 2017 at 103.0% of par plus accrued interest on redeemed amount, and (c) with settlement date at any time from December 27, 2017 to but not including the maturity date at 101.75% of par plus accrued interests on redeemed amount.
On June 27, 2016, GasLog also completed the issuance of NOK 750,000 (equivalent to $90,150) of new senior unsecured bonds in the Norwegian bond market (the "2021 Bond Agreement"). The 2021 Bond Agreement matures in May 2021 and has a coupon of 6.9% over 3 month NIBOR. The proceeds from the issuance were used to partly refinance GasLog's existing bonds maturing in June 2018, as described above.
The bond under the 2021 Bond Agreement bears interest at NIBOR plus margin. Interest payments are made in arrears on a quarterly basis. GasLog may redeem it in whole or in part as follows: (a) with settlement date at any time from June 27, 2019 to but not including June 27, 2020 at 104.0% of par plus accrued interest on redeemed amount, (b) with settlement date at any time from June 27, 2020 to but not including December 27, 2020 at 102.50% of par plus accrued interest on redeemed amount, and (c) with settlement date at any time from December 27, 2020 to but not including the maturity date at 101.0% of par plus accrued interests on redeemed amount.
The aggregate carrying amount under the 2018 Bond Agreement and the 2021 Bond Agreement (the "Bonds"), net of unamortized financing costs and unamortized premium, as of December 31, 2016 was $133,531 (December 31, 2015: $112,185) while their aggregate fair value was $138,741 based on a USD/NOK exchange rate of 0.1159 as of December 31, 2016 (December 31, 2015: $115,406, based on a USD/NOK exchange rate of 0.1137).
Corporate guarantorfinancial covenants
GasLog Partners'financial covenants
GasLog Partners as corporate guarantor for the GasLog Partners Credit Facility and the Five Vessel Refinancing is subject to specified financial covenants on a consolidated basis. These financial covenants include the following as defined in the agreements:
F-40

(i) the aggregate amount of all unencumbered cash and cash equivalents must be not less than the higher of 3% of total indebtedness or $15,000;
(ii) total indebtedness divided by total assets must be less than 60.0%;
(in) the ratio of EBITDA over debt service obligations as defined in the GasLog Partners guarantees (including interest and debt repayments) on a trailing 12 months basis must be not less than 110.0%; and
(iv) the Partnership is permitted to declare or pay any dividends or distributions, subject to no event of default having occurred or occurring as a consequence of the payment of such dividends or distributions.
The GasLog Partners Credit Facility and the Five Vessel Refinancing also impose certain restrictions relating to GasLog Partners, including restrictions that limit its ability to make any substantial change in the nature of its business or to change the corporate structure without approval from the lenders.
Compliance with the financial covenants is required on a semi-annual basis. GasLog Partners was in compliance with the respective financial covenants as of December 31, 2016.
GasLog's financial covenants
GasLog, as corporate guarantor for the loan facilities and the Bonds listed above except for the GasLog Partners Credit Facility, is subject to specified financial covenants on a consolidated basis.
The financial covenants include the following:
(i) net working capital (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) must be not less than $0;
(ii) total indebtedness divided by total assets must not exceed 75.0%;
(iii) the ratio of EBITDA over debt service obligations as defined in the respective credit facilities and the GasLog guarantees (including interest and debt repayments) on a trailing 12 months basis must be not less than 110.0%;
(iv) the aggregate amount of all unencumbered cash and cash equivalents must be not less than the higher of 3.0% of total indebtedness or $50,000 after the first drawdown ($20,000 in relation to the 2018 Bond Agreement);
(v) GasLog is permitted to pay dividends, provided that the Group holds unencumbered cash and cash equivalents equal to at least 4.0% of its total indebtedness subject to no event of default having occurred or occurring as a consequence of the payment of such dividends (not applicable for the Bonds); and
(vi) the Group's market value adjusted net worth must at all times be not less than $350,000.
The credit facilities also impose certain restrictions relating to GasLog, including restrictions that limit its ability to make any substantial change in the nature of its business or to engage in transactions that would constitute a change of control, as defined in the relevant credit facilities, without repaying all of the Group's indebtedness in full, or to allow the Group's largest shareholders to reduce their shareholding in GasLog below specified thresholds.
GasLog as issuer of the Bonds is required to comply with the financial covenants (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (vi) listed above. In addition, the 2018 Bond Agreement includes a dividend restriction according to which the Group may not (i) declare or make any dividend payment or distribution, whether in cash or in kind, (ii) repurchase any of the Group's shares or undertake other similar transactions (including, but not limited to, total return swaps related to the Group's shares), or (iii)
F-41

grant any loans or make other distributions or transactions constituting a transfer of value to the Group's shareholders (items (i), (ii) and (in) collectively referred to as the "Distributions") that in aggregate exceed during any calendar year 50% of the Group's consolidated net profit after taxes based on the audited annual accounts for the previous financial year (any unutilized portion of the permitted dividend pursuant to the above may not be carried forward). For the purposes of the above, the consolidated net profit after taxes of the Group shall not include any profits related to the sale of assets (and consequently any such profits related to such assets shall not form the basis for Distributions). On November 14, 2014, GasLog signed an amendment to the 2018 Bond Agreement to revise the covenants to reflect GasLog's growth and the anticipated growth of GasLog Partners. Under the amended agreement (a) GasLog is permitted to make Distributions up to an aggregate maximum per share, for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 of $1.10/share, $1.20/share and $1.30/share, respectively, provided that total indebtedness divided by total assets (giving pro forma effect for the Distribution) does not exceed 67.5% immediately after the Distribution is made, the ratio of EBITDA over debt service obligations on a trailing 12 months basis ending the quarter immediately prior to that in which the Distribution is made is not less than 115.0% and no event of default would result from such Distribution, (b) the amount of debt or committed debt availability that GasLog provides to GasLog Partners cannot exceed $75,000, and (c) GasLog has agreed to pay a one-time fee of 1.0% of the face value of the Bond.
As the above mentioned amendments to the covenants did not result in substantially different terms to the 2018 Bond Agreement, the amendments are considered a modification of the terms of the 2018 Bond Agreement. Consequently, the additional fees incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014 which amounted to $2,557 have been accounted as deferred financing fees and will be amortized over the remaining term of the 2018 Bond Agreement.
Also, under the 2021 Bond Agreement (a) GasLog is permitted to make Distributions up to a maximum amount per share per annum for the years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 of $1.00/share, $1.10/share, $1.10/share, $1.20/share, $1.20/share and $1.20/share, respectively, provided that GasLog can demonstrate by delivering a compliance certificate to the trustee of the 2021 Bond Agreement that no event of default is continuing or would result from such Distributions.
Compliance with the loan financial covenants is required on a semi-annual basis while compliance with the Bonds' covenants is required at all times. The Group was in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2016.

Debt Repayment Schedule
The maturity table below reflects the principal repayments of the loans and Bonds outstanding as of December 31, 2016 based on the repayment schedule of the respective loan facilities (as described above):

Total

As of December 31, 2016
156,645 881,843 1,254,997 406,517

The weighted average interest rate for the outstanding loan facilities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 3.54% (December 31, 2015: 3.32%) excluding the fixed interest rate for the interest rate swaps where hedge accounting is not applicable (Note 25).
After excluding the unamortised deferred loan issuance costs the carrying amount of the Group's bank debt recognized in the consolidated financial statements approximates its fair value since the debt bears interest at a variable interest rate.

F-45

Through its subsidiary GasLog LNG Services Ltd., the Group leases office space in Piraeus, Greece, from an entity controlled by Ceres Shipping, Nea Dimitra Ktirnatikh Kai Emporikh S.A. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Group reimbursed Nea Dimitra for part o f the renovation costs of the Piraeus office spaces.
Through its subsidiary GasLog Services (UK) Ltd., the Group makes payments to Euronav (UK) Agencies Ltd. ("Euronav UK"), a subsidiary o f Euronav NV, whose major shareholder was Mr. Livanos until November 2015, for the use o f its office space in London. Euronav UK leases operating space pursuant to a service agreement with a third-party property owner and the Group occupies a portion of the leased space. The Group pays Euronav UK £223 per year for the office space plus a stamp duty, which reflects a pro rata portion o f the fees payable to the third-party property owner determined based on the amount of occupied space. In addition, as o f December 31, 2014, the Group reimbursed Euronav UK for part o f the legal fees and other professional charges relating to the execution o f the lease agreement. In 2016, Euronav UK was no longer a related party of the Group, thus the respective office rent and utilities' expenses recorded in 2016 were not included in the above table.
GasLog LNG Services Ltd. has also entered into an agreement with Seres S.A., an entity controlled by the Livanos family, for the latter to provide catering services to the staff based in the Piraeus office. Amounts paid pursuant to the agreement are generally less than Euro 10 per person per day, but are slightly higher on special occasions. In addition, GasLog LNG Services Ltd. has entered into an agreement with Seres S.A. for the latter to provide human resources, telephone and documentation services for the staff based in Piraeus.
The Group through one of its subsidiaries, GasLog LNG Services Ltd., procured insurance for the vessels through C Transport Maritime S.A.M., an affiliate o f Ceres Shipping, which has a dedicated insurance function. From July 1, 2011, this relationship is covered by a service agreement under which GasLog LNG Services Ltd. pays C Transport Maritime S.A.M. $ 10 per owned vessel per annum and $3 per managed vessel per annum. The service agreement was terminated in 2015.
Chartwell Management Inc. is an entity controlled by the Livanos family, which provides travel services to GasLog's directors and officers.
Through GasLog the Group made payments to Unisea Maritime Ltd. ("Unisea Maritime"), an affiliate o f Ceres Shipping, for the use o f its office space in London. Unisea Maritime leased operating space pursuant to a service agreement with a third-party property owner and the Group occupied a portion o f the leased space from January to August 2014. The Group paid Unisea Maritime £4 per month for its office space in London, which reflects a pro rata portion o f the fees payable to the third-party owner determined based on the amount o f occupied space.
In connection to the sale and leaseback of the Methane Julia Louise in February 2016, GasLog entered into a consulting agreement with Unisea Maritime, under the terms of which GasLog agreed to pay a brokerage commission fee equal to 0.25% o f the agreed charter rates under the sale and leaseback transaction plus reasonable expenses (incurred in line with the Group policies). The brokerage commission fee o f $430 was paid in advance for the full 20--year period o f the bareboat charter, discounted to the date o f the agreement at an annual discount rate o f 7.5% and was included under "Vessel held under finance lease".
Blenheim Holdings Ltd. that is controlled by Ceres Shipping (Note 1), requested reimbursement o f professional expenses provided in 2015.
A.S. Papadimitriou and Partners Law Firm, an entity controlled by one o f our directors, provided legal services in relation to the legal due diligence process o f our investment in Gastrade S.A.

In accordance with the terms of the Plan, there are only service condition requirements. The awards will be settled in cash or in shares at the sole discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors. These awards have been treated as equity settled because the Group has no present obligation to settle in cash. The amount to be settled for each SAR exercised is computed in each case, as the excess, if any, of the fair market value (the closing price of shares) on the exercise date over the exercise price of the SAR.

Fair value
The fair value of the SARs has been calculated based on the Modified Black-Scholes-Merton method. Expected volatility was based on historical share price volatility for the period since the Group's initial public offering. The expected dividend is based on management's expectations of
F-47

future payments on the grant date. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the SARs are set out below:

In 2013, the fair value of the RSUs in accordance with the Plan was determined by using the grant date closing price of $13.26 per share and adjusting for the effect of the expected dividends to which holders of RSUs are not entitled using a risk-free interest rate of 0.4% for the three years until the expiry of the RSUs, which resulted in a fair value of $11.95 per RSU.

In 2014, the fair value of the RSUs in accordance with the Plan was determined by using the grant date closing price of $24.00 per share and adjusting for the effect of the expected dividends which holders of RSUs are not entitled using a risk-free interest rate of 0.91% for the three years until the expiry of the RSUs which resulted in a fair value of $22.58 per RSU.

In 2015, the fair value of the RSUs in accordance with the Plan was determined by using the grant date closing price of $19.48 per share and was not further adjusted since the holders are entitled to dividends.

In 2016, the fair value of the RSUs in accordance with the Plan was determined by using the grant date closing price of $9.28 per share and was not further adjusted since the holders are entitled to dividends.

As of December 31, 2016, 578,105 SARs have vested but not been exercised.

On April 1, 2015 and April 1, 2016, GasLog Partners granted to its executives, Restricted Common Units ("RCUs") and Performance Common Units ("PCUs") in accordance with its 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "GasLog Partners' Plan"). The RCUs and PCUs will vest three years after the grant dates subject to the recipients' continued service; vesting of the PCUs is also subject to the achievement of certain performance targets in relation to total unitholder return. Specifically, the performance measure is based on the total unitholder return ("TUR") achieved by the Partnership during the performance period, benchmarked against the TUR o f a selected group of peer companies. TUR above the 75th percentile of the peer group results in 100% of the award vesting; TUR between the 50th-75th percentile of the peer group results in 50% of award vesting; TUR below the 50th percentile of the peer group results in none of the award vesting. The holders are entitled to cash distributions that are accrued and will be settled on vesting.

The details of the aforementioned awards are presented in the following table:

23. Financial Risk Management
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. The Group makes use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to moderate certain risk exposures.
F-51

Market risk
Interest rate risk: The Group is subject to market risks relating to changes in interest rates because it has floating rate debt outstanding. Significant increases in interest rates could adversely affect the Group's operating margins, results of operations and its ability to service its debt. The Group uses interest rate swaps to reduce its exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates. The principal objective of these contracts is to minimize risks associated with its floating rate debt and not for speculative or trading purposes. As of December 31, 2016, the Group has economically hedged 37.77% of its variable rate interest exposure relating to its existing loan facilities and the Bonds by swapping the variable rate to a fixed rate (December 31, 2015: 43.61% and December 31, 2014: 53.90%).
The aggregate principal amount of our outstanding floating rate debt as of December 31, 2016 was $1,695,302. As an indication of the extent of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, an increase in LIBOR by 10 basis points would increase the interest expense on the un-hedged portion of the Group's loans by approximately $1,433 (December 31, 2015: $1,315 and December 31, 2014: $678).
Interest rate sensitivity analysis: The fair value of the interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2016 was estimated as a net asset of $1,796 (December 31, 2015: net liability of $16,561). The effective movement in the fair value of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments (Note 25) amounting to $4,922 loss (December 31, 2015: $979 and December 31, 2014: $6,515) was recognized directly in equity.
The interest rate swap agreements described below are subject to market risk as they are recorded at fair value in the statement of financial position at year end. The fair value of interest rate swap liabilities increases when interest rates decrease and decreases when interest rates increase. As of December 31, 2016, if interest rates had increased or decreased by 10 basis points with all other variables held constant, the positive/(negative) impact, respectively, on the fair value of the interest rate and cross currency swaps would have amounted to $4,526 (December 31, 2015: $3,349 and December 31, 2014: $4,405). This amount would have affected other comprehensive income by $499 (December 31, 2015: $1,483 and December 31, 2014: $2,192) and the loss on swaps by $4,027 (December 31, 2015: $1,866 and December 31, 2014: $2,213).
Other price risk: The decrease in the fair value of Egypt LNG Shipping Ltd., in response to unfavorable market conditions resulting in a decrease in charter rates and vessel values, could negatively impact the value of the Group's investment in associate. Therefore, management might conclude that impairment is necessary in the future.
Currency risk: Currency risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Group's subsidiaries' functional currency. The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures primarily with respect to general and crew costs denominated in Euros ("EUR"). Specifically, for the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately $85,777 of the operating and administrative expenses were denominated in EUR (December 31, 2015: $78,131 and December 31, 2014: $68,928). As of December 31, 2016, approximately $12,799 of the Group's outstanding trade payables and accruals were denominated in EUR (December 31, 2015: $17,454).
The Group has entered into cross currency swaps (Note 25) to hedge its currency exposure from the Bonds and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency exposure from payments in EUR and GBP. In addition, management monitors the exchange rate fluctuations on a continuous basis. As an indication of the extent of the Group's sensitivity to changes in exchange rate, a 10% increase in the average EUR/USD exchange rate would have decreased the Group's profit and cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2016 by $8,578, based upon its expenses during the year (December 31, 2015: $7,813 and December 31, 2014: $6,893).
F-52

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that arises when the maturity of assets and liabilities does not match. An unmatched position potentially enhances profitability, but can also increase the risk of losses. The Group minimizes liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and by having available adequate amounts of undrawn credit facilities. The Group is not significantly exposed to liquidity risk resulting from the commitments under the vessel construction contracts as bank facilities have been contracted to meet the obligations.

The following tables detail the Group's expected cash flows for its non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables have been drawn up based on

the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. Variable future interest payments were determined based on an average LIBOR plus the margins applicable to the

Group's loans at the end of each year presented.

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to discharge its obligations and cause a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk in the

event of non-performance by any of its counterparties. To limit this risk, the Group deals exclusively with financial institutions and customers with

high credit ratings.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, 95.0% of the Group's revenue was earned from Royal Dutch Shell pic ("Shell"). For the year ended December 31, 2015, 83.1% of the Group's revenue was earned from BG Group and 11.8% from Shell and for the year ended December31, 2014, 80.1% of the Group's revenue was earned from BG Group and 11.7% from Shell and accounts receivable were not collateralized; however, management believes that the credit risk is partially offset by the creditworthiness of the Group's counterparties. BG Group was acquired by Shell on February 15, 2016. This acquisition does not impact the contractual obligations under the existing charter party agreements. The Group did not experience significant credit losses on its accounts receivable portfolio during the three years ended December 31, 2016. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements represents the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk. Management monitors exposure to credit risk, and they believe that there is no substantial credit risk arising from the Group's counterparties.

The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

24. Capital Risk Management
The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximize shareholders value.
F-54

The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is total debt divided by total equity plus total debt. The gearing ratio is calculated as follows:

Interest rate swap agreements
The Group enters into interest rate swap agreements which convert the floating interest rate exposure into a fixed interest rate in order to hedge a portion of the Group's exposure to fluctuations in prevailing market interest rates. Under the interest rate swaps, the bank counterparty effects quarterly floating-rate payments to the Group for the notional amount based on the three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR, and the Group effects quarterly payments to the bank on the notional amount at the respective fixed rates.

111 In July 2016, the Group terminated these interest rate swap agreements associated with the six legacy facilities that were refinanced by the Legacy Facility Refinancing (Note 13) paying their fair value on that date.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the amount o f the cumulative loss from the period that these hedges were effective that was recycled to profit or loss was $4,978 (December 31, 2015: $1,129).
131 In July 2016, GasLog entered into new interest rate swap agreements with a notional value o f $870,000 in aggregate, maturing between 2020 and 2022.
The derivative instruments listed above were not designated as cash flow hedging instruments. The change in the fair value of these contracts for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to a net gain of $18,448 (December 31, 2015: $149 loss, December 31, 2014: $7,873 loss), which was recognized against profit or loss in the period incurred and is included in Loss on swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the net gain of $18,448 derived mainly from the fact that the LIBOR yield curve, which was used to calculate the present value of the estimated future cash flows, was higher than the agreed fixed interest rates resulting in a decrease in derivative liabilities from interest rate swaps held for trading.

Cross currency swap agreements

The Group enters into CCSs which convert the floating interest rate exposure and the variability of the USD functional currency equivalent cash flows into a fixed interest rate and principal on maturity, in order to hedge the Group's exposure to fluctuations deriving from its Bonds.

The CCSs qualified as cash flow hedging instruments for accounting purposes.

The principal terms of the CCSs designated as cash flow hedging instruments were as follows:

111 On June 27, 2016, GasLog terminated the first three CCSs agreements and decreased the notional amount o f the remaining three CCSs by paying their fair value on that date. The cumulative loss o f $5,583 from the period that hedging was effective was recycled to profit or loss during the year ended December 31, 2016.
On June 20, 2016, in conjunction with the issuance o f the bond under the 2021 Bond Agreement (Note 13), GasLog entered into these CCSs to exchange interest payments and principal on maturity on the same terms as the 2021 Bond Agreement.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of CCSs amounting to a loss of $2,559 has been recognized in Other comprehensive income (December 31, 2015: $23,584 loss, December 31, 2014: $37,722 loss). For the year ended December 31, 2016, a loss of $2,446 was recycled to profit or loss representing the realized loss on CCSs in relation to the interest expenses component of the hedge (December 31, 2015: $2,714 loss, December 31, 2014: $60 gain). Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2016, a loss of $1,487, was recognized in Other comprehensive income in relation to the retranslation of the Bonds in U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016 (December 31, 2015: $21,000 gain, December 31, 2014: $31,106 gain).

Forward foreign exchange contracts
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate foreign exchange transaction exposures in British Pounds Sterling ("GBP") and EUR. Under these forward foreign exchange contracts, the bank counterparty will effect fixed payments in GBP or EUR to the Group and the Group will effect fixed payments in USD to the bank counterparty on the respective settlement dates. All forward foreign exchange contracts are considered by management to be part of economic hedge arrangements but have not been formally designated.

Fair value measurements
The fair value of the Group's financial assets and liabilities approximate to their carrying amounts at the reporting date.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps at the end of reporting period was determined by discounting the future cash flows using the interest rate yield curves at the end of reporting period and the credit risk inherent in the contract. The fair value of the CCSs at the end of the reporting period was determined by discounting the future cash flows that are estimated based on forward exchange rates and contract forward rates, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the counterparties. The Group uses its judgment to make assumptions that are primarily based on market conditions for the estimation of the counterparty risk and the Group's own risk that are considered for the calculation of the fair value of the interest rate and cross currency swaps. The interest rate swaps, the forward foreign exchange contracts and the CCSs meet Level 2 classification, according to the fair value hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. There were no financial instruments in Levels 1 or 3 and no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the periods presented. The definitions of the levels, provided by IFRS 13 are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
· Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; · Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); and
· Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
26. Non-cash Items on Statements of Cash Flows
As of December 31, 2016, there were capital expenditures for vessels and vessels under construction of $2,038 that were not paid during the year ended December 31, 2016 and were included in current liabilities (December31, 2015: $12,576, December31, 2014: $7,999).
As of December 31, 2016, there were equity raising costs of $5 that were not paid during the year ended December 31, 2016 and were included in current liabilities (December 31, 2015: $59, December 31, 2014: $174).
F-60

As of December 31, 2016, there were no loan issuance costs outstanding and included in current liabilities (December 31, 2015: $247, December 31, 2014: $903).
As of December 31, 2016, there were receivables from stock options exercise of $108 included in assets (December 31, 2015: $0, December 31, 2014: $0).

27. Taxation
Under the laws of the countries of the Group's domestication/incorporation and/or vessels' registration, the Group is not subject to tax on international shipping income. However, it is subject to registration and tonnage taxes, which are included in vessel operating and supervision costs in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the U.S. source gross transportation income of a ship-owning or chartering corporation, such as GasLog, is subject to a 4% U.S. Federal income tax without allowance for deduction, unless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax under Section 883 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. U.S. source gross transportation income consists of 50% of the gross shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States.
The Group did not qualify for this exemption for the three years ended December 31, 2016; however, the effect on the results is insignificant.

28. Earnings/(loss) per share ("EPS")

Basic earnings/(loss) per share was calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to the owners of the common shares by the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding during the year.

Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to the owners of the Group by the weighted average number of all potential ordinary shares assumed to have been converted into common shares, unless such potential ordinary shares have an antidilutive effect.

The following reflects the earnings and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

The Group excluded the effect of 1,713,702 SARs and 368,437 RSUs in calculating diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2016, as they were anti-dilutive (December 31, 2015: 576,014 SARs and 83,751 RSUs, December 31, 2014: 285,024 SARs and 74,877 RSUs).
29. Subsequent Events
In January 2017, Simon Crowe, GasLog and GasLog Partners' Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") informed the board of directors of his intention to step down from the position of CFO in March 2017.
On January 27, 2017, GasLog Partners completed an equity offering of 3,750,000 common units and issued 76,531 general partner units to its general partner (in order for GasLog to retain its 2.0% general partner interest in GasLog Partners) at a public offering price of $20.50 per unit, raising net proceeds of $75,488 (after excluding $1,569 from the sale of the general partner units to GasLog). The Partnership plans to use the net proceeds from the public offering for general partnership purposes, which may include future acquisitions, debt repayment, capital expenditures and additions to working capital. On February 24, 2017, GasLog Partners issued additional 120,000 common units and 2,449 general partner units in relation to the exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option resulting to additional net proceeds of $2,435 (after excluding $50 from the sale of the general partner units to GasLog).
On February 1, 2017, GasLog and GasLog Partners announced that, following Simon Crowe's decision to step down from his position as CFO, the board of directors appointed Alastair Maxwell as CFO with effective date early March 2017.
On February 9, 2017, GasLog acquired a 20% ownership interest in Gastrade, a private limited company licensed to develop an independent natural gas system offshore Alexandroupolis in Northern Greece utilizing a FSRU along with other fixed infrastructure.
On February 16, 2017, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per common share payable on March 16, 2017 to shareholders of record as of March 6, 2017.
On February 24, 2017, GasLog entered into three new interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of $300,000 in aggregate, maturing in February and March 2022.
