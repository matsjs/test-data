Reference is made to the press release dated 14 May 2018 with notice of result from the written procedure (the "Written Procedure") in relation to Aligera Holding AB (publ)'s ("Aligera") SEK 500,000,000 senior secured green bonds 2014/2019 with ISIN SE0005933231 (the "Bonds"), where holders approved the proposed restructuring plan for Aligera's assets (the "Restructuring"). Any capitalised term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning given to it in the terms and conditions for the Bonds or in the notice of the Written Procedure dated 13 April 2018 (the "Written Procedure Notice").

The closing date (the "Closing Date") and the relevant record date (the "Record Date") for closing of the Restructuring are:

Record Date: Closing Date:

20 June 2018 (the Bonds must be held on this date to participate in the Restructuring) 28 June 2018

On the Closing Date several actions will be taken as described in the Written Procedure Notice, including but not limited to the following actions and results:

· transfer of part of the nominal value of the Bonds through a mandatory and automatic securities conversion from the holders of the Bonds to a newly established company, AGBH Invest AB ("AGBH") (referred to as NewCo in the Written Procedure Notice) in exchange for the Convertibles (convertible instruments (Sw. konvertibler)) and the Reinstated Bond issued by AGBH;
· transfer of assets from Aligera's bankruptcy estate to AGBH with payment by way of set-off against part of the Bonds so transferred to AGBH;
· the issue of the SSF instrument by AGBH with the SSF participants as lenders; · the entry into an Investor Agreement governing the holding of Convertibles and
shares in in AGBH; · after completion of the Restructuring the holders of bonds will hold the
Convertibles, the Reinstated Bond and Bonds with a reduced nominal amount (the total nominal amount of these instruments will be MSEK 500, i.e., the current nominal amount of the Bonds) and, as regards those holders of Bonds who participate in the SSF, the SSF instruments.

Allocation of the SFF and the Reinstated Bonds will be made on or around the Closing Date. Allocation of the Convertibles will, due to technical and administrative reasons, be made as soon as possible after the Closing Date (estimated timing is one to a few business days after the Closing Date). Note that time-lapses might occur in the allocation.

HOLDERS OF BONDS NOTE THAT: As from the Record Date until the Closing Date, no trade can be made in the Bonds (the Bonds will for technical reasons be mandatory transferred to and held on an account of the issuing agent Aqurat Fondkommission AB

between the Record Date and the Closing Date). On the Closing Date, the Bonds with the remaining nominal amount after reduction (see above) will be transferred back to the holders of the Bonds.
