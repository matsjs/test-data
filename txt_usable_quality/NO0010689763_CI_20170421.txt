Dear Sirs,
Iona Energy Company (UK) Limited - Subject to a Company Voluntary Arrangement ( "the Company")
Final report to creditors
I refer to the appointment of Chad Griffin and I as Joint Supervisors' of the above Company Voluntary Arrangement ( "CVA") on 17 June 2016 and write to you with our final report in this matter. In accordance with Rule 1.23 of the Insolvency (Scotland) Rules 1986, I also enclose a summary of my final receipts and payments account, listed below.
I am writing to advise you of the successful completion of the voluntary arrangement following the sale of the shares of the Company on 13 April 2017.
Unless otherwise stated, capitalised terms shall have the meaning given to them in the CVA Proposal dated 1 June 20 16 (restated as at 21 February 2017 in accordance with clause 29.1).
Restatement of CVA
Per our letter dated 22 February 2017, the CVA required amendment. The original proposed purchaser of the Company's shares was unable to complete the share sale and a new Purchaser was found. Furthermore certain completion mechanics forming part of the share sale differed from the original CVA proposal.
Given the Fund and other key terms of the CVA were unchanged and there was no change to the position of unsecured creditors, no material amendment to the CVA were required. We therefore used our discretion under clause 29.1 of the CVA to modify the CVA. A copy of the revised CVA proposal is available at the following website: http://fticonsulting-emea.com/cip/iona-energy.
Receipts and payments
A summary of the Joint Supervisors' receipts and payments for the duration of the CVA from 17 June 20 16 to 21 April 2017 is detailed below. I advise that the only transactions are the receipt of the £ 1 ,55 3,2 30 CVA fund and the subsequent payment of the fund to CVA creditors.

Joint Supervisors' remuneration
The Joint Supervisors' have not drawn any fees or expenses from the CVA estate. Supervisors' fees and expenses were drawn from the Iona UK Huntington Limited (in administration) estate as set out in the CVA proposal.
Final distributions
A full and final distribution of £1 ,5 5 3 ,2 3 0 was made to all agreed creditors on 20 April 2017. Agreed creditor claims totalled £ 3 9,8 34,026 and therefore the distribution represented a dividend rate of 3.9p in the £.
Conclusion
As all funds in the CVA have been distributed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the arrangement I am therefore bringing the arrangement to a successful conclusion as it has been fully implemented.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all creditors for their support during the period of the arrangement and their participation in the CVA.
If you have any queries in relation to the contents of this letter please do not hesitate to contact William Marsden on the above number.

Yours faithfully For and on behalf of the Company and without personal liability
