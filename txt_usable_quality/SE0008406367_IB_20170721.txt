Stockholm 2017-07-21
Vostok New Ventures Ltd (the "Company") hereby gives notice to all holders of the Company's SEK 300,000,000 senior secured callable fixed rate bonds 2016/2019 with ISIN SE0008406367 (the "Bonds") of exercise of its option for early redemption of the Bonds in full, in accordance with section 11.3 of the terms and conditions for the Bonds.
Unless otherwise defined in this notice, all words and expressions defined in the terms and conditions for the Bonds shall have the same meaning in this notice.
The date on which the redemption will occur will be 17 August 2017, (the "Early Redemption Date"). The total outstanding amount of the Bonds is SEK 300,000,000. The Bonds will be redeemed at the Make Whole Amount being the amount equal to the sum of the present value on the Record Date of: (a) 103.25 per cent of the Nominal Amount (i.e. SEK 1,032,500 per Bond); and (b) the present value of the remaining interest payments (excluding accrued but unpaid interest up to the Early Redemption Date) up to and including 9 December 2017 (subject to the Business Day Convention); both calculated by using a discount rate of fifty (50) basis point over the comparable Swedish Government Bond Rate; and (c) accrued interest from, but excluding the preceding Interest Payment Date up to and including the Early Redemption Date (together, the "Make Whole Amount").
The Make Whole Amount per Bond amounts to approximately SEK 1,066,000 (based on today's Swedish Government Bond Rate with the final amount to be established in connection with the Early Redemption Date), and will be disbursed to Holders registered as owners of Bonds on the Record Date which will be 10 August 2017. In conjunction with the redemption, the Bonds will be delisted from the corporate bond list at Nasdaq Stockholm.
This notice of early redemption is irrevocable.
This notice of early redemption is governed by Swedish law. This notice is, for the avoidance of doubt, not an offer to purchase or sell financial instruments.
