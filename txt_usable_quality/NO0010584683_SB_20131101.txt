Oslo, November 1, 2013

Proposed changes to loan agreement - Summons to Bondholders' Meetings

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") is appointed as trustee for the abovementioned bond issue with ISIN NO 001 0584683 (the "Bond Loan") issued by Interoil Exploration & Production ASA (the "Issuer", the "Company" or "Interoil").

All capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein (including any attachment hereto) shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement for the Bond Loan dated 8 September 2010 (as amended) (the "Bond Agreement").

The information in this summons regarding the Issuer is provided solely by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1.

BACKGROUND

1.1 Initial Restructuring; separate holding of Peruvian and Colombian activities

Interoil has, as described in the Summons to Bondholder's Meeting dated 1 July 2013, initiated a process with a view to optimising the Interoil group holding structure. To this end, Interoil has commenced an intra-group restructuring in order to implement a more flexible holding structure for the Company's activities in Columbia and Peru (the "Initial Restructuring").

Prior to the Initial Restructuring, Interoil Exploration & Production Latin America AS ("LATAM") was the holding company for the activities in both Columbia and Peru. The purpose of the Initial Restructuring was to separate the holding of the activities in Peru and Colombia to two separate, wholly owned subsidiaries.

Interoil intended to implement the Initial Restructuring - in accordance with an approval given by the Bondholders in a Bondholder's Meeting held on 17 July 2013 -- by transferring the shares in Interoil Peru S.A. (Peru) ("IOP") and North Oil Services S.A.C. (Peru) ("NOSP") (IOP and NOSP together, the "Peruvian Companies") from LATAM to a new subsidiary of Interoil, Interoil Peru Holding AS ("IPH").

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
The transfer o f the Peruvian Companies from LATAM to IPH was intended to be carried out by way of a sale. The transaction has not been settled and completed.
1.2 Amended Restructuring; reversal of Initial Restructuring and implementation of new group structure
After the Initial Restructuring was approved, Interoil has become aware of certain regulatory issues in Peru which will have as its effect that the Initial Restructuring cannot, as previously anticipated, be consummated.
As a consequence of these regulatory issues, the Initial Restructuring will not be completed, and Interoil will as a consequence hold both its Peruvian and Colombian activities through LATAM. IPH - which was included as a Subsidiary in the Bond Agreement solely for the purpose of implementing the Initial Restructuring - will thus not hold any assets, and will therefore not be relevant with respect to the Security Interests created pursuant to the terms of the Bond Agreement. The Issuer will therefore propose that IPH is taken out from the Bond Agreement.
Interoil remains committed to implementing a flexible and robust company group structure by separating the holding of the Peruvian and Colombian activities. The Company has therefore resolved to transfer Interoil Columbia Exploration & Production Inc. (British Virgin Island) ("IOCO"), which holds and operates Interoil's Colombian assets, from LATAM to UP Colombia Holding AS ("UPCH") which is incorporated as a new wholly owned (100%) subsidiary of Interoil (the "Amended Restructuring").
UPHC is a Norwegian limited liability company with company registry number 912 384 551 and its registered address Klingenberggata 7 B, 0161 Oslo.
The Amended Restructuring will, as further described below, be implemented in a way which ensures that the Bondholder's Security Interests at no point in time are weakened. Interoil considers the implementation of the Amended Restructuring as a time critical issue, which should be implemented without undue delay. The Company will therefore execute the Amended Restructuring as soon as practically possible. Interoil will hence ask the Bondholder's Meeting to approve the necessary amendments to the Bond Agreement and give the necessary consents to the Amended Restructuring after the restructuring (as a matter of fact) has been implemented.
Interoil will establish identical Security Interests in relation to UPCH as those which are currently established in relation to LATAM. This includes implementation of the Share Charge, the General Pledge and the Guarantee, all on the terms and conditions set out in the Security Documents already entered into in relation to LATAM.
In order to ensure that the Security Interests established under the Bond Loan are at no point deteriorated or destabilised, Interoil will establish these Security Interests in relation to UPCH prior to the transfer of IOCO from LATAM to UPHC.

Attached hereto is a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), as Exhibit 1, indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered.)

The individual bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising the Bond Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details).

In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.

For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond Trustee, to notify the Bond Trustee by telephone or by e-mail (as set out at the first page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.

Yours Sincerely,

twt
