To the bondholders in: ISIN NO 001056580.7 - 4.50 per cent Marine Harvest ASA Convertible Bond
Issue 2010/2015 (the "Bonds")
Oslo, 13 November 2013
NOTIFICATION OF CALL OPTION EXERCISED Norsk Tillitsmann ASA acts as loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the above mentioned bond issue issued by Marine Harvest ASA (the "Borrower"). Reference is made to the stock exchange notice published by the Borrower today. The loan agreement for the Bonds (the "Loan Agreement") provides the Borrower with the right to redeem the remaining outstanding bonds at par value plus accrued interest under certain conditions. Marine Harvest has notified the Loan Trustee that clause 10.2 in the Loan Agreement has been fulfilled as the Marine Harvest share price for at least twenty days out of a period of thirty consecutive trading days has exceeded 130 per cent of the current conversion price of the Bonds. Furthermore, the Loan Trustee was informed that Marine Harvest is exercising its right to redeem the bond at par value plus accrued interest. The Loan Agreement provides the bondholders the period up to and including 21 November 2013 to exercise their rights to convert their bonds into shares. The remaining outstanding loan amount is EUR 224.9 million and the current conversion price is EUR 0.6443 per share. Assuming the proposed NOK 0.075 per share dividend is approved at the EGM of 15 November 2013, the conversion price will be adjusted accordingly from the ex-dividend date 18 November 2013. Such adjustment will also incorporate the impact of the NOK 0.05 per share dividend approved 16 September 2013 as this fell below the threshold for conversion price adjustments. Bonds that are not converted into shares will be redeemed at par value plus accrued interest. Final settlement date is 11 December 2013.
Sincerely, Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
