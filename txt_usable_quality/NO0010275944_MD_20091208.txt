A request of a Bondholders' meeting shall be made in writing and clearly state the matters to be discussed and the provisions of this Loan Agreement on which the request is based. The request shall be sent to the Loan Trustee.
18.2 The Bondholders' meeting shall be summoned by the Loan Trustee pursuant to the provisions of Clause 18.3. Simultaneously with the decision to summon the Bondholders' meeting, the Loan Trustee can demand that the Borrower does not increase the Loan Outstanding.
If the Loan Trustee has not complied with a valid request for a Bondholders' meeting as set forth in Clause 18.1 within five Banking Days after having received such request, then the Borrower and the relevant Bondholder(s) and - if the Loan is listed - the Oslo Børs have the right themselves to summon the meeting pursuant to the provisions of Clause 18.3.
18.3 The summons to a Bondholders' meeting shall be dispatched and if necessary notified at the latest five Banking Days before the date of the meeting.
The summons shall be effected by written notification through the Securities Depository to every Bondholder with known place of residence and - if the Loan is listed - Oslo Børs for publication. The notification through the Securities Depository shall also state the number of Bonds in the Loan (print-out) owned by the Bondholder in question at the time the print-out is made.
The summons shall clearly state the matters to be discussed at the Bondholders' meeting, and the provisions of this Loan Agreement on which the request is based and inform that the relevant documents are available from the Loan Trustee, the Borrower or at such other place as stated in the summons. If any change of the Loan Documents has been proposed, the main content of the proposal shall be stated in the summons.
The meeting can only make decisions regarding the matters which were stated in the summons, unless all the Bondholders in the Loan Outstanding agree otherwise subject to the provisions hereof.
If in order to make a valid decision it is necessary, pursuant to Clause 19 to hold a new Bondholders' meeting and discuss the matter a second time, such new Bondholders' meeting cannot be summoned before the first meeting has been held.

In the event that Bonds have been transferred after the print-out was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the meeting the original summons and the print-out, endorsed so as to document the transfer.
The Borrower's Bonds do not give the right to vote and are not taken into account when determining the number of voting Bonds.

19.1 In the event that less than 2/10 of the Loan Outstanding are represented, a valid decision may not be made at the first Bondholders' meeting at which the matter is discussed.

20.3 The Loan Trustee shall co-operate so that the new loan trustee is given, without undue delay after the bondholders' meeting, the documents and information necessary to perform his functions and duties under the Loan Documents.

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
If the Loan Trustee has not complied with a valid request for a Bondholders' meeting as set forth in Clause 20.1 within 10 - ten - Banking Days after having received such request, then the Borrower or the relevant Bondholder(s) or the Exchange, has the right to summon the meeting pursuant to the provisions of Clause 20.3.
20.3 The summons to a Bondholders' meeting shall be dispatched and if necessary notified at the latest 5 - five - Banking Days before the date of the meeting.
The summons shall be effected by written notification through the Securities Depository to every Bondholder with known place of residence and, if the Loan is listed, the Exchange for public announcement. The notification through the Securities Depository shall also state the number of bonds in the Loan (print-out) owned by the Bondholder in question at the time the printout is made.
The summons shall clearly state the matters to be discussed at the Bondholders' meeting, and inform that the relevant documents are available from the Loan Trustee, the Borrower and at such other place as stated in the summons. If any change of the Loan Agreement has been proposed, the main content of the proposal shall be stated in the summons.
The meeting can only make decisions regarding the matters, which were stated in the summons, unless all the Bondholders in the Outstanding Loan agree otherwise.
If in order to make a valid decision it is necessary, pursuant to Clause 21 of this Loan Agreement, to hold a new Bondholders' meeting and discuss the matter a second time, such new Bondholders' meeting cannot be summoned before the first meeting has been held. The summons to the second meeting shall inform of the turnout and result of the vote at the first Bondholders' meeting.
20.4 The meeting shall be held at the Loan Trustee's premises or at premises designated by the Loan Trustee.
The meeting shall be presided over by the Loan Trustee, unless the Bondholders' meeting decides otherwise. If the Loan Trustee is not present, the meeting shall be presided over by a Bondholder or trustee of the Bondholders, elected by the Bondholders.
The minutes of the meeting shall be kept, showing the Bondholders present - personally or by proxy - as well as how many votes each Bondholder can cast. Furthermore, the decisions made at the meeting, as well as the result of the vote, shall be recorded.

20.6 At the Bondholders' meeting each bond carries one vote. The notification of the number of bonds in the Loan (print-out) sent to each Bondholder through the Securities Depository in the summons to the meeting, see Clause 20.3, serves as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of each owners' right to vote. In the event that Bonds have been transferred after the printout was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the meeting the original summons and the printout, endorsed so as to document the transfer.
The Borrower's Bonds do not give voting rights and are not taken into account when determining the number of voting Bonds. Borrower's Bonds shall be deemed not to be outstanding for purposes of any resolution, waiver, approval or consent, whether taken at a meeting of the holders of the Bonds or otherwise.
In case of doubt, the Bondholders' meeting decides which Bondholders can vote and how many votes each one has.
20.7 In order for the Bondholders' meeting to be able to make valid decisions, Bondholders representing at least 2/10 of the Outstanding Loan must be represented, see, however, Clause 21.
In the event that the Bondholders present represent less than 5/10 of the Outstanding Loan, decisions may only be made by a 2/3 majority of the Bonds represented. If the Bondholders present represent 5/10 or more of the Outstanding Loan, valid decisions may be made by a simple majority, see however Clause 20.8 .
20.8 In the following matters a majority of 2/3 of the Bonds represented at the meeting must vote in favour of the decision:
(a) change of trustee,
(b) change of Borrower,
(c) material changes in this Loan Agreement, including interest, repayment date, and security/collateral, or
(d) corporate or business changes in the Borrower which are of material importance for the Borrower's fulfilment of the Loan Documents.
20.9 In all matters where unanimity is not attained, the voting shall be in writing and the number of votes shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. In case of a tie in the votes, the matter shall be decided by the chairman, even if he is not a Bondholder or proxy.
Decisions made at a Bondholders' meeting which entail changes to the Loan Documents shall be attached to this Loan Agreement in the form of a certified copy of the minutes of the meeting.

21.1 In the event that less than 2/10 of the Outstanding Loan are represented, valid decisions may not be made at the first Bondholders' meeting at which the matter is discussed. After a new meeting has been summoned and the matter discussed a second time, a valid decision may be made pursuant to the voting rules set forth above; this also applies to cases in which less than 2/10 of the Outstanding Loan is represented.
22 Change of Loan Trustee
22.1 In the event that the Borrower and/or Bondholders in accordance with Clause 20.8(b), wish to replace the Loan Trustee or a change of trustee is necessary according to law, regulation or ordinance, or the Loan Trustee has requested such change, the Loan Trustee shall immediately summon a Bondholders' meeting to discuss the matter.
The Loan Trustee shall suggest to the Bondholders' meeting a new trustee. The Bondholders and/or the Borrower or, if the Loan is listed, the Exchange may submit proposals.
The Bondholders and, if the Loan is listed, the Exchange shall after the Bondholders' meeting, be notified of the decision and the date on which the change of trustee becomes effective.
22.2 The Loan Trustee shall continue to discharge its duties until the new trustee has been elected. In the event that the Loan Trustee does not fulfil its obligations, or the interests of the Bondholders suffer, the Exchange may nominate a new, temporary trustee. The Borrower is liable for costs incurred by nomination of a temporary trustee, pursuant to Clause 17.4, but can, either in whole or in part, demand reimbursement from the former Loan Trustee, in the event that the change of trustee is due to breach of duty pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents, or other circumstances for which the Loan Trustee is responsible.
22.3 The Loan Trustee shall co-operate so that the new trustee is given, without undue delay after the Bondholders' meeting, the documents and information necessary to perform his functions and duties under the Loan Documents. The Loan Trustee shall provide a summary of the status under the Loan Documents.
23 Limitation
23.1 Claims for interest and principal shall be limited in time pursuant to the Norwegian act relating to the prescription period for claims dated 18 May 1979 no. 18.

If the Loan Trustee has not complied with a valid request for a Bondholders' meeting as set forth in Clause 20.1 within 10 - ten - Banking Days after having received such request, then the Borrower or the relevant Bondholder(s) or the Exchange, has the right to summon the meeting pursuant to the provisions of Clause 20.3.
20.3 The summons to a Bondholders' meeting shall be dispatched and if necessary notified at the latest 5 - five - Banking Days before the date of the meeting.
The summons shall be effected by written notification through the Securities Depository to every Bondholder with known place of residence and, if the Loan is listed, the Exchange for public announcement. The notification through the Securities Depository shall also state the number of bonds in the Loan (print-out) owned by the Bondholder in question at the time the printout is made.
The summons shall clearly state the matters to be discussed at the Bondholders' meeting, and inform that the relevant documents are available from the Loan Trustee, the Borrower and at such other place as stated in the summons. If any change of the Loan Agreement has been proposed, the main content of the proposal shall be stated in the summons.
The meeting can only make decisions regarding the matters, which were stated in the summons, unless all the Bondholders in the Outstanding Loan agree otherwise.
If in order to make a valid decision it is necessary, pursuant to Clause 21 of this Loan Agreement, to hold a new Bondholders' meeting and discuss the matter a second time, such new Bondholders' meeting cannot be summoned before the first meeting has been held.

20.6 At the Bondholders' meeting each bond carries one vote. The notification of the number of bonds in the Loan (print-out) sent to each Bondholder through the Securities Depository in the summons to the meeting, see Clause 20.3, serves as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of each owners' right to vote. In the event that Bonds have been transferred after the printout was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the meeting the original summons and the printout, endorsed so as to document the transfer.
The Borrower's Bonds do not give voting rights and are not taken into account when determining the number of voting Bonds. Borrower's Bonds shall be deemed not to be outstanding for purposes of any resolution, waiver, approval or consent, whether taken at a meeting of the holders of the Bonds or otherwise.
In case of doubt, the Bondholders' meeting decides which Bondholders can vote and how many votes each one has.
20.7 In order for the Bondholders' meeting to be able to make valid decisions, Bondholders representing at least 2/10 of the Outstanding Loan must be represented, see, however, Clause 21.

(b) change of Borrower,
(c) material changes in this Loan Agreement, including interest, repayment date, and security/collateral, or
(d) corporate or business changes in the Borrower which are of material importance for the Borrower's fulfilment of the Loan Documents.
20.9 In all matters where unanimity is not attained, the voting shall be in writing and the number of votes shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. In case of a tie in the votes, the matter shall be decided by the chairman, even if he is not a Bondholder or proxy.
Decisions made at a Bondholders' meeting which entail changes to the Loan Documents shall be attached to this Loan Agreement in the form of a certified copy of the minutes of the meeting.

20.3 The summons to a Bondholders' meeting shall be dispatched and if necessary notified at the latest 5 - five - Banking Days before the date of the meeting.
The summons shall be effected by written notification through the Securities Depository to every Bondholder with known place of residence and, if the Loan is listed, the Exchange for public announcement. The notification through the Securities Depository shall also state the number of bonds in the Loan (print-out) owned by the Bondholder in question at the time the printout is made.
The summons shall clearly state the matters to be discussed at the Bondholders' meeting, and inform that the relevant documents are available from the Loan Trustee, the Borrower and at such other place as stated in the summons. If any change of the Loan Agreement has been proposed, the main content of the proposal shall be stated in the summons.
The meeting can only make decisions regarding the matters, which were stated in the summons, unless all the Bondholders in the Outstanding Loan agree otherwise.
If in order to make a valid decision it is necessary, pursuant to Clause 21 of this Loan Agreement, to hold a new Bondholders' meeting and discuss the matter a second time, such new Bondholders' meeting cannot be summoned before the first meeting has been held. The summons to the second meeting shall inform of the turnout and result of the vote at the first Bondholders' meeting.
20.4 The meeting shall be held at the Loan Trustee's premises or at premises designated by the Loan Trustee.
The meeting shall be presided over by the Loan Trustee, unless the Bondholders' meeting decides otherwise. If the Loan Trustee is not present, the meeting shall be presided over by a Bondholder or trustee of the Bondholders, elected by the Bondholders.
The minutes of the meeting shall be kept, showing the Bondholders present - personally or by proxy - as well as how many votes each Bondholder can cast. Furthermore, the decisions made at the meeting, as well as the result of the vote, shall be recorded. The minutes shall be signed by the chairman and two Bondholders or proxies, elected by the Bondholder meeting.

20.6 At the Bondholders' meeting each bond carries one vote. The notification of the number of bonds in the Loan (print-out) sent to each Bondholder through the Securities Depository in the summons to the meeting, see Clause 20.3, serves as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of each owners' right to vote. In the event that Bonds have been transferred after the printout was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the meeting the original summons and the printout, endorsed so as to document the transfer.
The Borrower's Bonds do not give voting rights and are not taken into account when determining the number of voting Bonds. Borrower's Bonds shall be deemed not to be outstanding for purposes of any resolution, waiver, approval or consent, whether taken at a meeting of the holders of the Bonds or otherwise.
In case of doubt, the Bondholders' meeting decides which Bondholders can vote and how many votes each one has.
20.7 In order for the Bondholders' meeting to be able to make valid decisions, Bondholders representing at least 2/10 of the Outstanding Loan must be represented, see, however, Clause 21.
In the event that the Bondholders present represent less than 5/10 of the Outstanding Loan, decisions may only be made by a 2/3 majority of the Bonds represented. If the Bondholders present represent 5/10 or more of the Outstanding Loan, valid decisions may be made by a simple majority, see however Clause 20.8 .
20.8 In the following matters a majority of 2/3 of the Bonds represented at the meeting must vote in favour of the decision:
(a) change of trustee,
(b) change of Borrower,
(c) material changes in this Loan Agreement, including interest, repayment date, and security/collateral, or
(d) corporate or business changes in the Borrower which are of material importance for the Borrower's fulfilment of the Loan Documents.
20.9 In all matters where unanimity is not attained, the voting shall be in writing and the number of votes shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. In case of a tie in the votes, the matter shall be decided by the chairman, even if he is not a Bondholder or proxy.
Decisions made at a Bondholders' meeting which entail changes to the Loan Documents shall be attached to this Loan Agreement in the form of a certified copy of the minutes of the meeting.

21.1 In the event that less than 2/10 of the Outstanding Loan are represented, valid decisions may not be made at the first Bondholders' meeting at which the matter is discussed. After a new meeting has been summoned and the matter discussed a second time, a valid decision may be made pursuant to the voting rules set forth above; this also applies to cases in which less than 2/10 of the Outstanding Loan is represented.
22 Change of Loan Trustee
22.1 In the event that the Borrower and/or Bondholders in accordance with Clause 20.8(b), wish to replace the Loan Trustee or a change of trustee is necessary according to law, regulation or ordinance, or the Loan Trustee has requested such change, the Loan Trustee shall immediately summon a Bondholders' meeting to discuss the matter.
The Loan Trustee shall suggest to the Bondholders' meeting a new trustee. The Bondholders and/or the Borrower or, if the Loan is listed, the Exchange may submit proposals.
The Bondholders and, if the Loan is listed, the Exchange shall after the Bondholders' meeting, be notified of the decision and the date on which the change of trustee becomes effective.
22.2 The Loan Trustee shall continue to discharge its duties until the new trustee has been elected. In the event that the Loan Trustee does not fulfil its obligations, or the interests of the Bondholders suffer, the Exchange may nominate a new, temporary trustee. The Borrower is liable for costs incurred by nomination of a temporary trustee, pursuant to Clause 17.4, but can, either in whole or in part, demand reimbursement from the former Loan Trustee, in the event that the change of trustee is due to breach of duty pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents, or other circumstances for which the Loan Trustee is responsible.
22.3 The Loan Trustee shall co-operate so that the new trustee is given, without undue delay after the Bondholders' meeting, the documents and information necessary to perform his functions and duties under the Loan Documents. The Loan Trustee shall provide a summary of the status under the Loan Documents.
23 Limitation
23.1 Claims for interest and principal shall be limited in time pursuant to the Norwegian act relating to the prescription period for claims dated 18 May 1979 no. 18.
24 Notices

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
20.3 The summons to a Bondholders' meeting shall be dispatched and if necessary notified at the latest 5 - five - Banking Days before the date of the meeting.
The summons shall be effected by written notification through the Securities Depository to every Bondholder with known place of residence and, if the Loan is listed, the Exchange for public announcement. The notification through the Securities Depository shall also state the number of bonds in the Loan (print-out) owned by the Bondholder in question at the time the printout is made.
The summons shall clearly state the matters to be discussed at the Bondholders' meeting, and inform that the relevant documents are available from the Loan Trustee, the Borrower and at such other place as stated in the summons. If any change of the Loan Agreement has been proposed, the main content of the proposal shall be stated in the summons.
The meeting can only make decisions regarding the matters, which were stated in the summons, unless all the Bondholders in the Outstanding Loan agree otherwise.
If in order to make a valid decision it is necessary, pursuant to Clause 21 of this Loan Agreement, to hold a new Bondholders' meeting and discuss the matter a second time, such new Bondholders' meeting cannot be summoned before the first meeting has been held. The summons to the second meeting shall inform of the turnout and result of the vote at the first Bondholders' meeting.
20.4 The meeting shall be held at the Loan Trustee's premises or at premises designated by the Loan Trustee.
The meeting shall be presided over by the Loan Trustee, unless the Bondholders' meeting decides otherwise. If the Loan Trustee is not present, the meeting shall be presided over by a Bondholder or trustee of the Bondholders, elected by the Bondholders.

20.6 At the Bondholders' meeting each bond carries one vote. The notification of the number of bonds in the Loan (print-out) sent to each Bondholder through the Securities Depository in the summons to the meeting, see Clause 20.3, serves as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of each owners' right to vote. In the event that Bonds have been transferred after the printout was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the meeting the original summons and the printout, endorsed so as to document the transfer.
The Borrower's Bonds do not give voting rights and are not taken into account when determining the number of voting Bonds. Borrower's Bonds shall be deemed not to be outstanding for purposes of any resolution, waiver, approval or consent, whether taken at a meeting of the holders of the Bonds or otherwise.
In case of doubt, the Bondholders' meeting decides which Bondholders can vote and how many votes each one has.
20.7 In order for the Bondholders' meeting to be able to make valid decisions, Bondholders representing at least 2/10 of the Outstanding Loan must be represented, see, however, Clause 21.
In the event that the Bondholders present represent less than 5/10 of the Outstanding Loan, decisions may only be made by a 2/3 majority of the Bonds represented. If the Bondholders present represent 5/10 or more of the Outstanding Loan, valid decisions may be made by a simple majority, see however Clause 20.8 .
20.8 In the following matters a majority of 2/3 of the Bonds represented at the meeting must vote in favour of the decision:
(a) change of trustee,
(b) change of Borrower,
(c) material changes in this Loan Agreement, including interest, repayment date, and security/collateral, or
(d) corporate or business changes in the Borrower which are of material importance for the Borrower's fulfilment of the Loan Documents.
20.9 In all matters where unanimity is not attained, the voting shall be in writing and the number of votes shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. In case of a tie in the votes, the matter shall be decided by the chairman, even if he is not a Bondholder or proxy.
Decisions made at a Bondholders' meeting which entail changes to the Loan Documents shall be attached to this Loan Agreement in the form of a certified copy of the minutes of the meeting.

After a new meeting has been summoned and the matter discussed a second time, a valid decision may be made pursuant to the voting rules set forth above; this also applies to cases in which less than 2/10 of the Outstanding Loan is represented.
22 Change of Loan Trustee
22.1 In the event that the Borrower and/or Bondholders in accordance with Clause 20.8(b), wish to replace the Loan Trustee or a change of trustee is necessary according to law, regulation or ordinance, or the Loan Trustee has requested such change, the Loan Trustee shall immediately summon a Bondholders' meeting to discuss the matter.

The Bondholders and, if the Loan is listed, the Exchange shall after the Bondholders' meeting, be notified of the decision and the date on which the change of trustee becomes effective.
22.2 The Loan Trustee shall continue to discharge its duties until the new trustee has been elected. In the event that the Loan Trustee does not fulfil its obligations, or the interests of the Bondholders suffer, the Exchange may nominate a new, temporary trustee. The Borrower is liable for costs incurred by nomination of a temporary trustee, pursuant to Clause 17.4, but can, either in whole or in part, demand reimbursement from the former Loan Trustee, in the event that the change of trustee is due to breach of duty pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents, or other circumstances for which the Loan Trustee is responsible.
22.3 The Loan Trustee shall co-operate so that the new trustee is given, without undue delay after the Bondholders' meeting, the documents and information necessary to perform his functions and duties under the Loan Documents. The Loan Trustee shall provide a summary of the status under the Loan Documents.
23 Limitation
