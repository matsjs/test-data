ANNEX 1 - BONDHOLDERS' RESOLUTION
The following resolution was adopted by the bond issue with ISIN NO 001 035368.3 (Feb 2013 Bond):
NTM is authorised and instructed on behalf of the holders of the Bonds referred to in the heading to this summons to:
(a) enter into an engagement letter with Blackstone on substantially similar fee terms to those described above, but otherwise to be in such form as may be approved by the NTM;
(b) enter into an indemnification letter with Blackstone on substantially similar indemnification terms to those described above, but otherwise to be in such form as may be approved by the NTM;
(c) instruct the paying agent(s) for the Feb 2013 Bonds, the Mar 2013 Bonds and the Jul 2013 Bonds that all payments under (d) (e) (f) below shall be made to NTM (and not directly to Bondholders) out of payments to be made by the Borrower under the said Bonds;
(d) pay the Monthly Retainers and out of pocket expenses of Blackstone as a joint first priority (pro rata to amounts payable to or by NTM on a joint first priority basis) out of any cash recoveries received by the Loan Trustee (on behalf of Bondholders) and ahead of Success Fees payable to Blackstone, any payment of Blackstone Indemnity amounts to Blackstone, or any payments by the Loan Trustee into the Indemnity Escrow Account, and ahead of payments of principal, interest and premium on the Bonds, to be allocated either on an equal basis as between the Bond Issues, or such other basis that NTM considers to be equitable to each Bond Issue;
(e) pay the Success Fees of Blackstone with respect to any particular Bond issue as a second priority out of any cash recoveries received by the Loan Trustee (on behalf of Bondholders) and ahead of any payment of Blackstone Indemnity amounts to Blackstone, or any payments by the Loan Trustee into the Indemnity Escrow Account, and ahead of payments of principal, interest and premium on the relevant Bonds; and
(f) make payment with respect to the Blackstone Indemnity, on the basis described above, as a third priority out of any cash recoveries received by the Loan Trustee (on behalf of Bondholders);
(g) make payment into the Indemnity Escrow Account to the extent of any cash recoveries received by NTM on behalf of Bondholders from distributions received by NTM on behalf of the Bondholders in any bankruptcy, liquidation or other analogous insolvency proceedings of any Prodjack Subsidiary or of the Company itself. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnity Escrow Account shall not be funded from any cash recoveries received in respect of any cash interest, coupon payments, or principal redemptions in respect of any of the Bonds (provided that the Loan Trustee, where it is acting in good faith, shall not be required to retain amounts to meet claims with respect to the Blackstone Indemnity, once all $2 milllion has been paid into the Indemnity Escrow Account).
Release any amounts remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account to the Bondholders at the latest 36 months after the date of termination of Blackstone's engagement; provided that at the time any remaining funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account are released to the Bondholders, NTM shall have the right to deduct any expenses incurred by NTM in connection with the administration of the Indemnity Escrow Account (to the extent not paid from other sources) before any distributions to the Bondholders.
