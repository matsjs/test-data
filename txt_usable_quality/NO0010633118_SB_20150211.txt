ISIN NO 001 0633118 Seabird Exploration PLC Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2011/2015

Oslo, 11 February 2015
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of the bonds ("SBX03 Bonds") in the above mentioned issue with ISIN NO 001 0633118 issued by SeaBird Exploration PLC (the "Company").
Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 16 December 2011, as amended and restated from time to time (the "Bond Agreement").
The meeting has been convened to propose a restructuring solution to the Bondholders, as described in further detail below.
The Bondholders are encouraged to read this summons (the "Summons") in its entirety.
The information in this Summons regarding the Company and market conditions are provided by the Company and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.
1.2 Events of Default
The Company is a borrower under an unsecured convertible loan agreement with an outstanding amount of USD 14,900,000 with Perestroika AS (the "Perestroika Loan"). The Perestroika Loan matured on 30 September 2014 and the loan documentation provided for a 5 business day grace period for repayment (the "Grace Period"). The Grace Period expired on 7 October 2014 which in turn triggered an event of default under Clause 19.3 (Cross default) of the Bond Agreement (the "Cross Default"). Since then there have been numerous further Events of Default that are outstanding and continuing under the Bond Agreement, including, without limitation, the Company has breached or may breach its liquidity and book equity ratio financial covenants, as set out at Clause 15.3 {Financial covenants) of the Bond Agreement and has failed in October 2014, November 2014 and December 2014, and is likely to continue to fail, to make the monthly payment from the Guarantors' Earnings Accounts to the Bond Service Account pursuant to Clause 16.18 {Bond Service Account payments) of the Bond Agreement, which have given or may give rise to further events of default pursuant to Clauses 19.1 {Non-payment) and 19.2 {Breach o f other

300920345 v6

2 (11)
obligations) of the Bond Agreement (together with the Cross Default, the "Events of Default").
1.3 Restructuring Discussions
In consultation with an informal ad hoc committee of Bondholders who together hold over 50% of the principal amount outstanding of SBX03 Bonds (the "Committee"), the Bond Trustee has, on behalf of the Bondholders, engaged, amongst others, Akin Gump LLP ("Akin Gump") to act as legal counsel to the Bond Trustee and to represent the interests of the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders in connection with the financial position of the Company and its affiliates (the "Group") including (without limitation) restructuring discussions and negotiations regarding the SBX03 Bonds.
The Bond Trustee and Akin Gump have been in discussions with the Group and its advisers for a number of months in connection with the outstanding Events of Default and a potential restructuring of the SBX03 Bonds.
As a result of these restructuring discussions, the Company has approached the Bond Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to propose a potential restructuring solution to the Bondholders (the "Restructuring"), the detailed terms of which are set out in the restructuring term sheet set out at Appendix 1 (the "Restructuring Term Sheet"). In addition, the Company has requested that the Bondholders temporarily waive the Events of Default in order to facilitate the implementation of the Restructuring.
The Company believes that the Restructuring is essential to enable the Company to meet its immediate funding requirements and maintain the Company as a going concern.
In addition to this Summons, the Company has provided a separate document enclosed as Appendix 2 to this Summons, which provides an update of the Company's financial and operational status as well as its reasons for proposing the Restructuring.
1.4 Summary of Restructuring
Set out below is a summary of key terms of the Restructuring. The Bondholders should read the Restructuring Term Sheet and Appendix 2 to this Summons in full in order to properly understand the terms of the Restructuring and the Company's reasons for proposing it.
The Restructuring will, in summary, involve: (a) a minimum of USD 8,500,000' being raised in new equity at a subscription price of NOK 0.1 per share (the "New Money Equity").

(i) USD 1,511,465 corresponding to interest claims against the Group accrued on or about the relevant due dates in September 2014 have been included and are reflected in the respective aggregate amounts set out above to be converted into debt and/or equity.

4 Given the subscribed New Money Equity amount o f USD 11,640,625, the below figures vary from the relevant figures described in the restructuring presentation of the Company dated 30 January 2015, which were calculated based on the minimum New Money Equity subscription amount of USD 8,500,000.
3All figures provided with respect to the new capital structure of the Group post-Restructuring assume full-dilution and exercise in full of all warrants issued in connection with the New Money Equity.
6The New Money Equity amount of USD 11,640,625 includes the subscription by the SBX03 Bonds with all monies standing to the credit of the Bond Service Account in an amount of USD 2,259,045.
7 The actual principal amount outstanding of SBX03 Bonds is USD 81,851,042 and interest accmed thereon due on 19 December 2014 is USD 2,455,531, resulting in an aggregate of USD 84,306,572. However, the amount outstanding for purposes of SBX03 Bonds conversion calculation is reduced to USD 80,851,042 by the following: (i) USD 2,259,045 standing to the credit of the Bond Service Account (comprising of USD 1,000,000 allocated to outstanding amortization payments and USD 1,259,045 allocated to outstanding interest payments) used for subscription of New Money Equity by SBX03 Bondholders and (ii) USD 1,196,485 to reflect the commercial agreement whereby interest accmed on indebtedness of the Group shall only be recognised in the amount accmed until the respective relevant date in September 2014 (i.e. not until 19 December 2014). Thus, the aggregate amount of New Ordinary Shares allocated to SBX03 Bonds (resulting from USD 2,259,045 New Money Equity subscription and USD 64,680,834 debt-to-equity conversion of amounts under the SBX03 Bonds) is 1,981,956,000 corresponding to 50.17 % of the post-restructuring share capital of the Company (on a fully diluted basis and assuming exercise in frill of all warrants issued in connection with the New Money Equity).

Following completion of the Restructuring on the terms set out in this Summons, all amounts under the SBX03 Bonds (including the interest amount accrued thereon due on 19 December 2014) will be deemed to be fully discharged and the SBX03 Bonds (including the interest amount accrued thereon due on 19 December 2014) will be cancelled from VPS as soon as practicable thereafter.

The Bondholders further authorise the Bond Trustee to enter into such agreements and documents, consent to such waivers and amendments, take any actions and do all such things on behalf o f the Bondholders as may be necessary or desirable to support or give effect to the Proposal and the Proposal Conditions, and/or the exercise o f the Bond Trustee's discretion, including, without limitation, amending and/or waiving the terms o f the Bond Agreement and agree that neither the Bond Trustee, nor its advisers, nor any members o f the Committee shall have any liability whatsoever to any Bondholder or any other person in connection with the Restructuring"

Please find attached a bondholder's form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printed date (the "Bondholder's Form"). The Bondholder's Form will serve as your proof of ownership of the SBX03 Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' meeting (if the SBX03 Bonds are held in custody - i.e., the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm: (i) the owner of the SBX03 Bonds, (ii) the aggregated nominal amount of the SBX03 Bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the SBX03 Bonds are registered).
The individual Bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising the Bond Trustee to vote, must then be returned (by e-mail, telefax or post) to the Bond Trustee in advance of the Bondholders' meeting.
In the event any of the SBX03 Bonds are transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form has been submitted to the Bond Trustee but before the Bondholders' meeting has taken place, the new Bondholder (i.e. the transferee of the SBX03 Bonds) must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of their ownership of the SBX03 Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request that those who intend to attend the Bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than the Bond Trustee, notify the Bond Trustee of such intention by telephone or by e-mail by no later than 16:00 hours (4pm) (Oslo time) the Business Day before the Bondholders' meeting takes place.

1 Note: Amount may vary insignificantly. 2 Note: Given the subscribed New Money Equity amount of USD 11,640,625, the below figures vary from the relevant figures described in the restructuring presentation of the Company dated 30 January 2015, which were calculated based on the minimum New Money Equity subscription amount of USD 8,500,000. 3 Note: All figures provided assume full-dilution and exercise in full of all Warrants by the New Money Equity Subscribers. 4 Note: Includes subscription by SBX03 Bondholders of all monies standing to the credit of the Bond Service Account in an amount of USD 2,259,045. 5 Note: The actual principal amount outstanding of SBX03 Bonds is USD 81,851,042 and interest accrued thereon due on 19 December 2014 is USD 2,455,531, resulting in an aggregate of USD 84,306,572. However, the amount outstanding for purposes of SBX03 Bonds conversion calculation is reduced to USD 80,851,042 by the following: (i) USD 2,259,045 standing to the credit of the Bond Service Account (comprising of USD 1,000,000 allocated to outstanding amortization payments and USD 1,259,045 allocated to outstanding interest payments) used for subscription of New Money Equity by SBX03 Bondholders and (ii) USD 1,196,485 to reflect the commercial agreement whereby interest accrued on indebtedness of the Group shall only be recognised in the amount accrued until the respective relevant date in September 2014 (i.e. not until 19 December 2014). Thus, the aggregate amount of New Ordinary Shares allocated to SBX03 Bonds (resulting from USD 2,259,045 New Money Equity subscription and USD 64,680,834 debt-to-equity conversion of amounts under the SBX03 Bonds) is 1,981,956,000 corresponding to 50.17 % of the post-restructuring share capital of the Company (on a fully-diluted basis and assuming exercise in full of all Warrants).

Shared Security:
Intercreditor Agreement:

The Security created by the Security Document shall secure Tranche A and Tranche B of the Bonds and the Scan Bunk Credit Facility in the following manner:
a) If an Event of Default is declared under the Bond Agreement, the A Bondholder shall be obliged to take over the Multi-Client libraries comprised by the Specified Floating Charges (as defined below). Upon such take over, the Tranche A Bonds and any accrued, but unpaid interest thereon shall be redeemed and cancelled in full by the take over, irrespective of whether the value of the assets taken over at the relevant time is less than the total outstanding amounts under the Tranche A Bonds at such time.
Following take over, Multi-Client libraries shall be exclusively owned by the Tranche A Bondholder and all decisions relating to the commercial utilisation and/or sale of the Multi-Client libraries shall be decided upon by the Tranche A Bondholder.
25 % of all net income of any nature whatsoever deriving from the Tranche A Bondholder's utilisation (howsoever) or sale or other disposal of the Multi-Client libraries shall be promptly paid to the Bond Trustee, the Paying Agent or another party appointed by the Bond Trustee for distribution to the Tranche B Bondholders and Scan Bunk on a pro rata basis until such time as all outstanding amounts to the Tranche B Bondholders and Scan Bunk are repaid (from whatever sources including through realisation of other Security). The Bond Trustee shall be entitled, at the reasonable cost of the Tranche A Bondholder, to appoint an independent auditor to examine the financial accounts of the Tranche A Bondholder to verify the compliance of this provision, provided that this request shall only take place once a year and be requested within 12 month of the end of the relevant fiscal year.
b) In case of a forced sale (private or public) of any assets of the Group, other than an enforced sale of the Multi-Client libraries as regulated in sub-paragraph (a) above, the Tranche B Bondholders and Scan Bunk shall be treated as senior lenders with a first priority right to full recovery on a pro rata basis. The surplus, if any, shall be applied against full recovery of the Tranche A Bondholder(s) on a pro rata basis.
c) All decisions relating to enforcement against any assets of the Group other than the Multi-Client libraries pursuant to the terms of Security Documents shall be exclusively voted and decided upon by the Tranche B Bondholders.
"Specified Floating Charges" means the following floating charges:
a) The Multi-Client Company's Floating Charge; b) the Aquila's Floating Charge; and c) the Raven's Floating Charge;9
The Issuer shall keep an inventory of the Multi-Client library (the "MC Inventory"). The inventory shall specify (i) place of survey, (ii) recording date, (iii) current book value, (iv) licenses made, (v) scheduled amortisations, vi) the entity that owns the survey and (vii) any joint venture partners and government share. The MC Inventory shall be updated quarterly and be attached to each Compliance Certificate delivered to the Bond Trustee.
The above security principles and realisation rights provisions in respect of the Shared Security shall be regulated in a separate intercreditor agreement between the Bond Trustee (who shall also act as a security trustee for the secured parties), the Tranche A Bondholders, the Tranche B Bondholders and Scan Bunk.

9 SBX's intention is to transfer the MC library held by Raven to Multi Client. The floating charge should not prevent this transfer taking place and a subsequent liquidation of Raven.

Except for any permitted cash collateral allowed under Negative Pledge (iv) below, all accounts of the Issuer and the Original Guarantors in any International Bank (other than the Escrow Account) shall be pledged in favor of the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the bondholders) but not blocked unless there is an outstanding Event of Default.

(i) any Vessel is sold or otherwise disposed of (except for a sale or transfer to another Group Company, provided that the Bond Trustee maintains its Security position as contemplated by this Term Sheet);
(ii) the Parent ceases to be the owner (directly or indirectly) of 100% of the shares in any of the Original Guarantors (except for a sale, transfer or liquidation, provided the relevant Guarantor at the time of such disposal does not own or charter a Vessel);
(iii) the Multi Client library pledged under the Specified Floating Charges are sold as a whole; or
(iv) there is an actual or constructive total loss of any Vessel (a "Total Loss Event").

Mandatory Prepayment:

Subject to the Asset Replacement Option below, upon a Mandatory Prepayment Event (other than a Total Loss Event) occurring, the Issuer shall, on or about the day the proceeds are received following the relevant Mandatory Prepayment Event, use all proceeds, net of transaction costs, to redeem Outstanding Bonds at par value (plus accrued unpaid interest on the redeemed Bonds) and the Scan Bunk Credit Facility (plus accrued but unpaid interest) in the following manner:
(i) If the Mandatory Repayment Event is triggered by a hive-off of all of the Multi-Client libraries, % of the net sales revenues therefrom shall be distributed to the Tranche A Bondholders on a pro rata basis. The remaining % of the net sales revenues shall be distributed to the Tranche B Bondholders and Scan Bunk on a pro rata basis. Any remaining proceeds after the Tranche A Bondholders have

received full recovery, shall be used in recovery of the Tranche B Bondholders and Scan Bunk on a pro rata basis.
(ii) For any other Mandatory Repayment Event, the net sales revenues therefrom shall be distributed to the Tranche A Bondholder, the Tranche B Bondholders and Scan Bunk on a pro rata basis.
For the avoidance of doubt, the redemption prices above shall be determined based on the date the Mandatory Repayment Event occurred and not based on the date of repayment.
Subject to the Asset Replacement Option below, upon a Total Loss Event, the Issuer shall promptly once insurance proceeds are available to it, redeem Outstanding Bonds with the net insurance proceeds at 100% of par value (plus accrued unpaid interest on the redeemed Bonds).
The proceeds from a Mandatory Prepayment Event in respect of a Vessel sale may be applied to acquire and/or replace an existing Vessel with a replacement vessel and/or equipment (a "Replacement Asset") provided that such acquisition/replacement takes place no later than the later of (i) 12 months after the date that the relevant Mandatory Prepayment Event occurred and (ii) 6 months after the date the proceeds from such event were received by the relevant Group Member. The proceeds from the relevant Mandatory Prepayment Event shall in the interim period be paid directly into an escrow account to be pledged on first priority in favor of the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders). If the purchase price of such Replacement Asset is less than the proceeds from such Mandatory Prepayment Event, the residual amount shall be applied to redeem the Outstanding Bonds at 100% of par value (plus accrued unpaid interest on the redeemed Bonds).
The Group Company being the owner of such Replacement Asset shall assume the position of an Original Guarantor and the Issuer and the Parent shall procure that the Replacement Asset shall be secured in the same manner as described under Security and the arrangements shall provide no less favorable (and acceptable to the Bond Trustee) security to the Bond Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders as was provided at the Settlement Date for the replaced Vessel.
The Bond Agreement shall include standard remedy and event of default provisions as well as cross default provisions for the Issuer and any other Group Company on any single financial indebtedness in excess of USD 5 million.
The Finance Documents will contain waterfall provisions in case of partial payments, i.e. first to cover costs, fees and expenses of the Bond Trustee (the "Trustee Expenses") and thereafter any other outstanding amounts under the Finance Documents. In case the Issuer does not pay the Bond Trustee for incurred fees, then the Bond Trustee may seek funding of the Trustee Expenses from other sources, in which case such other sources will be subrogated into the position of the Bond Trustee, but subordinate any further Bond Trustee expenses.
Means an event or circumstance which has a material adverse effect on: (a) the business, financial condition or operations of the Parent and/or the Group taken as a whole, (b) the Parent's ability to perform and comply with its obligations under the Bond Agreement; or (c) the validity or enforceability of the Bond Agreement or any Security Document.
Means;
(i) if any person or group (as such term is defined in the Norwegian Limited Liability Companies Act § 1-3) becomes the owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the outstanding shares and/or voting rights of the Issuer; or
(ii) a de-listing of the Parent's shares from the stock exchange.

Appendix 2 Update provided by the Company

Background The SeaBird group (the "Group") is a global provider of marine acquisition for 2D/3D and 4D seismic data, and associated products and services to the oil and gas industry. SeaBird specializes in high quality operations within the high end of the source vessel and 2D market, as well as in the shallow/deep water 2D/3D and 4D market. The main focus for the Group has historically been proprietary seismic surveys (contract seismic). The Group owns four vessels (Harrier Explorer, Aquila Explorer, Osprey Explorer and Northern Explorer) and charters four vessels (Geo Pacific, Hawk Explorer, Voyager Explorer and Munin Explorer) through bareboat agreements.
Towards the end of 2013 it became apparent that the Group's working capital was insufficient to cover its debt repayment obligations for a period of 12 months, in particular the unsecured convertible loan agreement with an outstanding amount of USD 14.9 million with Perestroika AS maturing in September 2014 (the "Perestroika Loan") and the purchase option on the Hawk Explorer for USD 6.5 million due in August 2014. The Group therefore sought refinancing alternatives in the capital markets.
Starting early 2014 the Group actively engaged with its largest stakeholders with the objective of effecting a refinancing. To that extent, Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee"), in its capacity as bond trustee acting for and on behalf of the holders of the 6.00 per cent. SeaBird Exploration PLC Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2011/2015 with ISIN NO 001 0633118 ("SBX03") in consultation with an informal ad hoc committee who together hold over 50% of the principal amount outstanding of SBX03 (the "Committee") explored several alternatives to restructuring the Group in conjunction with the Group's financial advisors, ABG Sundal Collier, Fearnley Securities AS and RS Platou and the Company's management.
The global seismic industry experienced a significant drop-off in activity around the time of the second quarter of 2014. The resulting reduction in contract survey engagements during this time negatively impacted the Group's liquidity position. In order to manage the Group's tight liquidity position, the Group actively managed its trade payables. In addition, in order to maintain a conservative operational cash balance, the Group increased the stretch in suppliers such that overdue trade payables increased to USD 15.4 million by the end of September, up from historical levels of USD 8-10 million. Other payables such as taxes also remained unpaid and continued to accrue. Moreover, the Group negotiated to delay the delivery of the Hawk Explorer and deferred payment of the USD 6.5 million purchase option by over 18 months following its expiry on 31 August 2014. In light of limited demand in the market, the Group also made the decision to lower its vessel capacity and cold stacked the Voyager Explorer by the end of 2014.
In October 2014, at the request of the Committee, SeaBird Exploration Plc (the "Company") engaged AlixPartners London LLP to, amongst other things, assist with information flow and to engage with the various stakeholders and advisers in order to achieve a restructuring with a sustainable capital structure.
Financial Position for the 9 months to September 2014 Financial result and operations The Group reported consolidated revenues of USD 101.2 million for the first nine months of 2014 ending 30 September 2014, compared to USD 138.5 million reported for that same period in 2013. Charter hire and operating expenses amounted to USD 67.9 million for the first nine months of 2014 ending 30 September 2014, down from USD 97.8 million for the three first quarters of 2013.
Depreciation and amortization increased to USD 31.9 million for the first nine months of 2014 ending 30 September 2014 from USD 18.6 million, mainly due to increased multi-client sales amortisation and impairment during the period.

Balance sheet At 30 September 2014, cash and cash equivalents amounted to USD 10.0 million, compared to USD 14.0 million at 30 September 2013. Net interest-bearing debt at 30 September 2014 was USD 92.9 million, up from USD 87.0 million at 30 September 2013, mainly due to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents. Property, plant and equipment at 30 September 2014 was USD 112.9 million, down from USD 129.4 million at 30 September 2013, mainly due to normalised depreciation. The multi-client library at 30 September 2014 was USD 21.1 million up from USD 6.6 million for the same period in 2013, mainly due to an increase in multi-client activity.
Cash flow statement Net cash flow from operating activities was USD 42.4 million for the first nine months of 2014 ending 30 September 2014 compared to USD 26.5 million for the first nine months of 2013 ending 30 September 2013. Net cash flow from financing activities was negative USD 8.5 million for the first nine months of 2014 ending 30 September 2014 compared to negative USD 6.7 million for the first nine months of 2013 ending 30 September 2013; predominantly due to the movement in borrowings.
Developments from September 2014 to December 2014 The Company defaulted when the Perestroika Loan matured on 30 September 2014. This in turn triggered a cross-default under SBX03. Both Perestroika AS and the Bond Trustee declared the events of default but have not at this point declared amounts owing to them under the Perestroika Loan and SBX03, respectively, to be due for immediate payment.
Nonetheless, the Group increased its backlog to approximately USD 270 million at the beginning of Q4, enabling it to consider raising debt in the capital markets subject to an equitisation of existing lenders. Following negotiations with the various key stakeholders, including Nordic Trustee and the Committee, the Company went to market the week commencing 24 November 2014 looking to raise a bridge facility and at least USD 35 million in a 3-year secured bond bearing 12%.
This approach was undermined by the precipitous drop in oil prices. Brent crude was at USD 112 per barrel early July. In September 2014 the spot price of fell from USD 103 to just above USD 95 per barrel. By the end of October it was USD 86. By the end of November it had dropped further to USD 68 per barrel and is trading below USD 50 per barrel currently. In the ensuing climate of uncertainty regarding the offshore oil services sector the Group evaluated alternative structures including raising equity, reducing debt and obtaining the participation of certain vendors and vessel owners. Simultaneously, the Group continued to firm up its backlog and secured letters of intent and letters of award for a number of key contracts including a large Gulf of Mexico survey to be carried out by the Group on behalf of TGS NOPEC. The Group's current backlog is summarised in the tables below:

During this time, the Group's trade payables stretch increased. In particular, unpaid charter hires grew to USD 4.4 million by the end of October and USD 7.3 million by the end of December.

The Transaction Following sustained negotiations between the Group and its major stakeholders at the end of 2014 and in the first two weeks of 2015, the terms of a consensual agreement were formulated. The transaction contemplated restores the balance sheet to a position where the Group can maintain adequate liquidity levels in order to execute its backlog. The key features of the transaction include a new equity injection of at least USD 8.5 million, the conversion of USD 28.8 million, existing debt and trade payables into a new bond and debt facilities and USD 5 million fresh capital to be provided in respect of the new bond. Moreover, the transaction was facilitated by the major stakeholders of the Group, for example one of the Group's large customers will participate in the new bond with new money, the existing SBX03 bondholders are contributing a significant amount of the new equity and charter rate reductions have been agreed going forward with the Group's key suppliers.

The Group's backlog stands at around USD 270 million, half of which is secured, representing almost 5 vessel years. Excluding cold-stacked vessels (Voyager Explorer and Geo Pacific estimated to be cold stacked by the end of Q1 2014) this represents around 84% of the capacity of the 6 operational vessels in 2015, enabling the Group to generate cash from operations in 2015. During this time the Group expects to operate principally with its 2D vessels: Aquila Explorer, Harrier Explorer, Hawk Explorer, Munin Explorer, Northern Explorer and Osprey Explorer. The Voyager Explorer and Geo Pacific are at the moment expected to remain cold stacked for 2015.

The Group believes that the combination of operational cash flow in 2015 (EBITDA is projected at USD 40.1 million), the improved terms on its charter hires and the conversion of certain supplier debt into the new bond will permit a normalisation of commercial terms with vendors through the course of 2015.
