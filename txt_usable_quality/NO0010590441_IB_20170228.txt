2 COUPON CLAIMS

The Issuer announced on 17 February 2016 that they would not pay its financial creditors, including the scheduled interest payments and amortizations on the Bonds. Separate coupon claims have since then been established in relation to the scheduled Interest Payment Dates, and registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS) as separate coupon claims ("Coupon Claims"). The new bonds, shares, cash and warrants (as applicable) delivered to each Bond Issue will be allocated pro rata to the holders of the principal claim ("Principal Claims") and Coupon Claims (both including relevant accrued interest). Allocations shall be made to the registered holders of Principal Claims and Coupon Claims in VPS on the record date (Restructuring Implementation Date) with settlement two Business Days thereafter.

The Coupon Claims can be traded independent of the principal claim in VPS. However, the Coupon

Claims do not have an ISIN and cannot be traded within the ordinary settlement system. Settlement of

trades of the Principal Claims in VPS will by default not include the Coupon Claims unless it is manually

prior to the Restructuring Implementation Date.
