SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETINGS

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the Bondholders in the abovementioned bond loans - all of which are documented in a second amended and restated bond loan agreement (the "Second Amended and Restated Bond Loan Agreement") adopted through an amendment and restatement agreement dated 20 February 2013.

Capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Second Amended and Restated Bond Loan Agreement.

When used herein "Tranche" shall mean each of or any of (as the context requires) the Tranche A Bonds, the Tranche B Bonds, the Tranche C l Bonds and the Tranche C2 Bonds.

The information in this summons regarding the legal, operational andfinancial status o f the Obligors and market conditions is provided by the Issuers, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

Bondholders are encouraged to read this Summons in its entirety, including all Schedules and any other attached documents.

1

Background

The Issuers have summoned a Bondholders' Meeting for each Tranche with the main purpose of

proposing to the relevant Bondholders that they resolve (among other things) to approve the

amendments of certain provisions of the Finance Documents, as further described in Schedule 2

(Details o f the Amendments) hereto (collectively, the "Amendments"), and to authorise the Bond

Trustee to enter into the agreements, documents and instruments necessary to give effect to the

Amendments.

The Amendments are being suggested to the Bondholders as a consequence of the delay in the delivery of Hull 717 - and which in turn has delayed the process of refinancing the New Tranche A Bonds and the New Tranche B Bonds, both of which mature on 21 February 2014 under the terms of the New Bond Loan Agreement regardless of actual delivery of Hull 717. The holders of the New Tranche A Bonds and the New Tranche B Bonds have agreed to extend the maturity of the New

Tranche A Bonds and the New Tranche B Bonds in return for shares in the Parent Guarantor. The background for the Amendments and the issuance o f shares in the Parent Guarantor in respect therewith are further described in the press release from the Parent Issuer attached as Schedule 3 (Press release dated 30 January 2014) hereto. The Parent Guarantor continues its work on getting Hull 717 on a charter and the process of refinancing the New Tranche A Bonds and the New Tranche B Bonds.

The Amendments include the following:

(a)

An amendment to Clauses 12.2(g) and 12.2(h) of the Second Amended and Restated Bond

Loan Agreement which relate to the circumstances in which an auction process must be

launched in respect of Hull 717. The amendment will permit the auction process to be

launched immediately after the new maturity date for New Tranche A Bonds and New

Tranche B Bonds rather than the original requirement to launch the auction 20 Banking Days

before the scheduled delivery of Hull 717. This amendment is requested to facilitate a

refinancing of the New Tranche A Bonds and the New Tranche B Bonds in the period

leading up to the Delivery Date for Hull 717.

(b)

An amendment to the terms o f the share pledge agreement (the "Share Pledge Agreement")

dated 20 February 2013 and relating to the pledge of the Parent Issuer's (Cecon ASA) shares

in the Parent Guarantor (Rever Offshore AS). The amendment will remove any potential

uncertainty there might be on whether the issuance of shares in the Parent Guarantor to a

third party require those shares to be pledged in favour of the Bond Trustee as First Security

Agent and Second Security Agent. It is the opinion of the Issuers that the Parent Guarantor

shall have, and has had, the right to issue new shares to third parties without it being required

that such new shares shall be pledged. However, Bondholders are asked to consent to the

relevant amendments to avoid any potential uncertainty there might be on the matter. Any

additional shares in the Parent Guarantor subscribed or otherwise acquired by the Parent

Issuer must be pledged as security to the First Security Agent and the Second Security

Agent, cf. Clause 3 of the Share Pledge Agreement.

(c)

In addition, under Clause 12.11(b) of the Second Amended and Restated Bond Loan

Agreement, the Tranche A Bondholders are entitled to appoint one director to the Parent

Guarantor. The Bondholders in the Tranche A Bonds are asked to approve the appointment

of Mark Purits as the Tranche A Bondholder nominated director to the board of the Parent

Guarantor. A short biography for Mr. Purits is attached as Schedule 5 {Mark Purits

Biography) hereto.

Background

The Issuers have summoned a Bondholders' Meeting for each Tranche with the main purpose of proposing to the relevant Bondholders that they resolve (among other things) to approve the amendments of certain provisions of the Finance Documents, as further described in Schedule 2 {Details o f the Amendments) hereto (collectively, the "Amendments"), and to authorise the Bond

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE

Trustee to enter into the agreements, documents and instruments necessary to give effect to the Amendments.

The Amendments are being suggested to the Bondholders as a consequence of the delay in the delivery of Hull 717 - and which in turn has delayed the process of refinancing the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds, both of which mature on 21 February 2014 regardless of actual delivery of Hull 717. The holders of the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds have agreed to extend the maturity of the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds in return for shares in the Parent Issuer. The background for the Amendments and the issuance o f shares in the Parent Issuer in respect therewith are further described in the press release from the Parent Guarantor attached as Schedule 3 (Press release dated 30 January 2014) hereto. The Parent Issuer continues its work on getting Hull 717 on a charter and the process of refinancing the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds.

The Amendments include the following:

(a)

An amendment of the definition of "Tranche A and B Maturity Date" whereby the maturity

dated is extended to 1 April 2014 or, if elected by the Parent Issuer, to 1 May 2014. It is the

opinion o f the Issuers that the extension of the maturity date for the Tranche A Bonds and

the Tranche B Bonds does not require the consent from the Bondholders in the other

tranches. However, Bondholders are asked to consent to the relevant amendments to avoid

any uncertainty there might be on the matter.

(b)

An amendment to Clauses 13.2(g) and 13.2(h) o f the Second Amended and Restated Bond

Loan Agreement which relate to the circumstances in which an auction process must be

launched in respect of Hull 717. The amendment will permit the auction process to be

launched immediately after the new maturity date for the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche

B Bonds rather than the original requirement to launch the auction 20 Banking Days before

the scheduled delivery of Hull 717. This amendment is requested to facilitate a refinancing

of the Tranche A Bonds and the Tranche B Bonds in the period leading up to the Delivery

Date for Hull 717.

(c)

An amendment to the terms of the share pledge agreement (the "Share Pledge Agreement")

dated 20 February 2013 and relating to the pledge of the Parent Guarantor's (Cecon ASA)

shares in the Parent Issuer (Rever Offshore AS). The amendment will remove any potential

uncertainty there might be on whether the issuance of shares in the Parent Issuer to a third

party require those shares to be pledged in favour of the Bond Trustee as First Security

Agent and Second Security Agent. It is the opinion of the Issuers that the Parent Issuer shall

have, and has had, the right to issue new shares to third parties without it being required that

such new shares shall be pledged. However, Bondholders are asked to consent to the relevant

amendments to avoid any potential uncertainty there might be on the matter. Any additional

shares in the Parent Issuer subscribed or otherwise acquired by the Parent Guarantor must be

pledged as security to the First Security Agent and the Second Security Agent, cf. Clause 3

of the Share Pledge Agreement.
