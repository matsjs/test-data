Oslo, 5 July 2013 NOTICE OF PARTIAL REPAYMENT OF THE 10.85% BOND LOAN Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed as loan trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond loan (the "Bond Loan" or the "10.85 Bond Loan"). The Bond Loan is registered in the Norwegian Securities Depository (the "VPS"). The Loan Trustee has now received amount of approximately USD 11.5 million designated for payment to the 10.85% Bondholders. The amount is paid by TOT Drilling Limited ("TOT") on the basis of the latest decision from the Gulating Court of appeal where TOT is sentenced to pay this amount to the 10.85 Bond Loan. Reference is further made to earlier resolutions at several bondholders meeting in the Bond Loan regarding funding of the acceleration of the Bond Loan and the corresponding security, funding of several litigation issues in connection with the acceleration of the Bond Loan, and security for certain advisors. As a result of the funding and security requirements, the Loan Trustee has retained substantial amounts from funds received on behalf of the Bondholders. In the present situation where the Gulating Litigation is nearly finalized (TOT has appealed the verdict of coverage of legal costs to the Supreme Court), the Loan Trustee has made a new assessment of the funding and security requirements. Based on this assessment it is decided that the amount retained by the Loan Trustee may be reduced by paying an amount of USD 6.0 million to the Bondholders. Payment to the Bondholders The aggregate of the two amounts indicated above, together USD 17.5 million will be paid to the Bondholders as of 10 July 2013 (Record Date) with payment on 12 July 2013 (Payment Date). The payment will constitute a payment of principal equal to 6.92695 % of remaining outstanding amount prior to the payment.
