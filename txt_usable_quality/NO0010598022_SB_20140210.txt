To the Bondholders in:

ISIN N0001059802.2 - 14 per cent NBT AS Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2010/2013 (the "Bond Issue")

Summons to Bondholders' Meeting

Oslo, 10 February 2014

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the abovementioned Bond Issue, which is documented in the bond agreement dated 29 December 2010 (the "Bond Agreement") where NBT AS is the issuer of the Bonds (the "Issuer").

Capitalised terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings ascribed to such terms in the Bond Agreement.

The information in this summons regarding the legal, operational and financial status of the Issuer and market conditions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1 Background
Due to the fact that Group Alrai Holdings Limited ("Alrai") has been delayed in obtaining financing for its investment of USD 250,000,000 in Issuer and Alrai not yet have waved its condition for its funding, the Issuer proposes to postpone the Final Maturity Date of the Bond Issue and the Interest payment structure. Further, the Issuer proposes to make other amendments to the Bond Agreement as set out below. This Proposal (as defined below) is part of a total refinancing process of the Issuer that also includes a plan to raise additional equity in the Issuer of up to NOK 125 million. The refinancing plan is outlined in more detailed below.

The Issuer has approached the Bond Trustee with a request to summon a Bondholders' meeting in order to put forward a proposal to the Bondholders to amend the Bond Agreement in connection with the matters described in this summons letter.

2 Refinancing plan
The Bond Issue matures on 10 March 2014 with a repayment obligation of NOK 128.75 million plus accrued interest. The Issuer currently has no available funds or unconditional funding commitments, and hence is not able to repay the Bond Issue at the current maturity date (10 March 2014). Further, the Issuer needs funding for its investment commitments, planned investments, ongoing operations and other obligations. In order to raise capital for these funding requirements the Issuer has established a syndicate consisting of a number of underwriters (the "Syndicate") that has undertaken to make an offer to acquire warrants which otherwise may lapse following the expiry date of the warrants (24 February 2014), and exercise any warrants so acquired. The offer price for

the warrants will be up to NOK 1 per warrant, and the Syndicate has undertaken to acquire and exercise warrants which following exercise will provide the Issuer with NOK 100 million in new equity. If all warrants issued by the Issuer are exercised on or prior to expiry date on 24 February 2014, this will result in approximately 125 million of new equity being contributed to the Issuer. However, there is a risk that warrants not guaranteed by the Syndicate will lapse following the expiry date (being 24 February 2014) because they are not otherwise exercised, in which case the total amount of equity contributed to the Issuer will be less than NOK 125 million (but never less than NOK 100 million).

The Issuer's net capital requirement for the period from today to June 2015 is estimated to be about NOK 135 - 140 million. In addition to the planned equity funding of up to 125 MNOK, the Issuer proposes to establish a bridge facility/working capital facility of up to NOK 40 million. If such bridge/working capital facility is obtained, the Issuer will be fully funded until the end of June 2015. Prior to the end of June 2015 the Issuer need to raise additional funding for financing its loan repayment obligations, operations and investments. The refinancing plan is necessary in order for the Issuer to carry on operations and develop its project portfolio, particularly the wind farm projects in Pakistan. The financial closing (expected during Q3 2014) of the Malakoff joint venture, with subsequent commencement of the construction of the 250 MW wind farm park, will add considerable value to the Issuer. This will also prove the Issuer's ability to develop wind farm projects in Pakistan.

The Issuer would like to underline that the equity raised through the expected up to NOK 125 million equity issue mainly will be applied to strengthen the wind farm portfolio in the subsidiaries of the Issuer. The shares in the subsidiaries NBT Renewable Energy Ltd in Cyprus and NBT Renewable Energy Singapore Pte Ltd are pledged in favor of the Bondholders. Hence the application of the proceeds from the up to NOK 125 million expected equity issue will increase the value of the pledged shares which will strengthen the position for the Bondholders.

The Syndicate's commitment according to the syndicate agreement is subject to the approval of the resolutions in this Bond Issue as set out below.

3 Proposal
Against the above background, the Issuer requests the Bondholders' Meeting to approve the following proposal (the "Proposal"):

3.1

Final Maturity Date: The Final Maturity Date of the Bond Issue is postponed from 10 March

2014 until 30 June 2015, and the new definition of "Final Maturity Date" in the Bond

Agreement is amended to read as follows:

"Final Maturity Date" means 30 June 2015 or an earlier maturity date as provided for in this Bond Agreement. Any further adjustment may be made according to the Business Day Convention.

For the avoidance of doubt, the maturity price and the call price shall remain 103% of par value (plus accrued and unpaid interest on the redeemed amount).

3.2

Interest: In the period between 30 December 2013 and the new Final Maturity Date, only

the original Fixed Rate will accrue on the Bonds. No default interest will be payable.

#4016691/4

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
Accrued interest from 30 December 2013 to be calculated according to the interest calculation in the Bond Agreement and shall be repaid at the Final Maturity Date together with the principal. The Issuer proposes that Clause 9.2 of the Bond Agreement is amended to read as follows:
Interest payments shall be made semi-annually in arrears on the Interest Payment Dates, the first Interest Payment Date being 30 June 2011. From 30 December 2013, interest will be paid by way of issuing additional Bonds (Payment-In-Kind).
3.3 Financial Statements: The requirement to make the Financial Statements available by sending them to the Bond Trustee shall be extended from 150 days to 180 days after the end of the financial year, and the word "150" in Clause 13.2.1 (c) of the Bond Agreement is deleted and replaced with the word "180".
3.4 Payment of loans and interest, additional financial indebtedness: The Issuer has obtained short term interest bearing loans of NOK 31,200,000 as of today' date, exclusive of interest (the "Short Term Loans"). Most of these loans are given by the Issuer's CEO Joar G. Viken. The Issuer shall be permitted to repay the loans plus accrued interest to Joar G. Viken as follows: (i) Immediately repay NOK 7,950,000 of the Short Term Loans plus accrued interest;
(ii) During second half of 2014, repay NOK 5,000,000 of the Short Term Loans plus accrued interest;
(iii) Repay all other Short Term Loans with such amounts as needed for Joar G. Viken to participate in the Syndicate and subscribe warrants which are not otherwise subscribed by other underwriters, if relevant; and
(iv) Be permitted to make interest payments each year under the remaining Short Term Loans.
The final maturity of the remaining balance of the Short Term Loans shall be postponed until 1 October 2015.
Further, the Issuer shall be permitted to make any interest payment pursuant to the terms of the unsecured convertible bond issue 2012/2015 dated 10 September 2012 (the "2012/2015 Bond Agreement"), the first interest payment being 14 September 2014.
Finally, the Issuer shall be permitted to incur up to NOK 40 million (excluding interest) of Financial Indebtedness arising under any bridge facility or working capital facility entered into by the Issuer following the date hereof.
Accordingly, the Issuer proposes that Clause 13.3 (b) (i) in the Bond Agreement is amended to read as follows:
The Issuer shall not incur or permit to remain outstanding, any Financial Indebtedness (whether secured or unsecured) unless such Financial Indebtedness is fully subordinated to its obligations under this Bond Agreement in all respects. Notwithstanding the above, the

#4016691/4

Issuer shall be permitted to (i) immediately repay the NOK 5,000,000 short term loan from Joar G. Viken dated 19 September 2013 and the NOK 2.950,000 short term loan from Joar G. Viken dated 29 January 2014, in both cases together with accrued interest; (ii) during the second half of 2014, repay the NOK 5,000,000 short term loan from Joar G. Viken dated 19 December 2013 together with accrued interest; (Hi) if relevant, repay all other Short Term Loans with such amounts as needed for Joar G. Viken to purchase and exercise currently outstanding warrants of the Issuer which are not otherwise exercised by other warrant holders prior to their expiry date; (iv) make annual cash interest payments under the Issuer's remaining Short Term Loans, (v) make cash interest payments pursuant to the unsecured convertible bond issue 2012/2015 dated 10 September 2012 with ISIN NO 001 0659873, (vi) incur up to NOK 40 million (excluding interest) of Financial Indebtedness arising under any bridge facility or working capital facility entered into by the Issuer following the date hereof, and (vii) immediately following issuance of new shares by the Company as a result of settlement of all warrants exercised on or before 24 February 2013, repay up to NOK 7 million of short term debt for general corporate purposes incurred on or after 10 February 2014 plus any interest thereof. The final maturity of the Issuer's remaining short term loans shall be postponed until 1 October 2015.

Further, it shall not constitute a cross default if the Issuer does not pay interest under its permitted financial indebtedness. The Issuer proposes that the definition "Permitted Financial Indebtedness" is included in the Bond Agreement to read as follows:

"Permitted Financial Indebtedness" means (i) Financial Indebtedness arising under the unsecured convertible bond issue 2012/2015 dated 10 September 2012 with ISIN NO 001 0659873, and (ii) Financial Indebtedness up to NOK 40 million (excluding interest) arising under any bridge facility or working capital facility entered into by the Issuer following the date hereof.

The Issuer proposes that Clause 15.1 (c) first paragraph is amended by way of inserting a new paragraph after sub-paragraph (iv) which shall read as follows:

Notwithstanding items (i) - (iv) above, no cross default shall occur in relation to any non payment of interest in respect of any Permitted Financial Indebtedness.

3.5

into an asset transfer agreement with ITS dated 31 December 2011 in connection with the

spin-off of its IPR project and sale to ITS. The purchase price was settled by a seller credit.

including interest, while variable payment rights are based on net-sales of sale or use of

the IPR rights is capped at NOK 89,700,000. The Issuer is considering selling the receivable

against ITS, and the Issuer proposes that Clause 13.3 (f) in the Bond Agreement is amended

to read as follows:

receivables against Impact Technology Solutions AS has to comply with Section 3-8 of the Private or Public Limited Companies Acts 1997.
