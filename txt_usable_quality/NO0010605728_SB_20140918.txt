BACKGROUND AND CORPORATE UPDATE

In recent years, PA Resources has struggled to overcome challenges inherited from several legacy issues, in particular the failed investment in the Azurite field which resulted in material losses for the Company and has led to the Company's recent financial difficulties. During 2013 and 2014, the Company with its new management has taken several measures to reduce financing and execution risk while progressing the Company's asset portfolio, including:
· Raising SEK 815 million in new equity capital during 2013
· Maturing of development plans on key assets

1

· Completion of farm-outs in the Company's assets in Denmark and the Republic of Congo and the farm-out agreement in the offshore Tunisian assets pending approvals
· Commissioned a third party review of Reserves and Contingent Resources by independent consultant firm ERC Equipoise ("ERCE")
As previously communicated, and in accordance with the plans presented in connection with the equity and bond financings in 2013, PA Resources is working to establish a financing plan for 2015 and onwards that addresses the funding of the material investments required to realise the value of its asset portfolio. It is the Company's view that a significant amount of new equity is required in order to fund the planned operations through 2015 and beyond, and the Board expects that PA Resources' debt position will need to be addressed through the execution of the financing plan. The scope of the financing plan is dependent on the outcome of ongoing government approval processes in Tunisia, concerning the Company's farm-down transaction to EnQuest pic and a license extension on the Company's Zarat license, which includes the Zarat and Elyssa fields. Due to the materiality of the assets related to these approvals, the Company's view is that it is not able to raise new equity capital until further clarity is achieved in Tunisia. In the meantime, the Company is examining ways of preserving liquidity and has taken actions in order to do so without disrupting ongoing business or future value of asset developments. In late September and early October the Company has scheduled interest payments on its (i) Working Capital Facility ("WCF"), (ii) Reserve Based Lending ("RBL") facility, (iii) NOK bonds and (iv) SEK bonds (together the "Debt Facilities") amounting to a total of USD 22 million, whereof USD 21 million relates to interest payments on the Company's bonds (split USD 7 million and USD 14 million for the NOK and SEK bond issues respectively). Given its current liquidity position, the Company will not be able to settle these interest payments in cash and hence proposes to defer all interest payments on all its Debt Facilities. The Company has reached an agreement with its largest creditor and shareholder, the Gunvor Group, for the upcoming interest payments under the WCF and RBL facilities. Under this agreement, Gunvor accepts that all unpaid interest (in total USD 1 million) together with future interest payments will be rolled up to and including 31 March 2015. The agreement is however conditional upon the acceptance by the bondholders in the NOK and SEK bond issues of the proposed amendments which have been summoned for. It is the view of the Company's management and board of directors that a timely execution of the proposal is in the best interest of all PA Resources' stakeholders. Approval of the proposed amendments will give the Company necessary time to prepare and execute a long-term financing plan following clarification of government approval processes in Tunisia, securing transparency on the future of PA Resources' key assets and developments.

The Bondholders are encouraged to review such information and, if necessary, consult with the Issuer for any further details. 2. PROPOSAL FOR AMENDMENTS (a) Pursuant to the information provided above, the Issuer requests that the Bondholders adopt the

iii. for the period from, and including, the Interest Payment Date in October 2014 to, but excluding, the Interest Payment Date in April 2015, the amount of the Deferred Interest Payment will carry an interest which accrues at an interest rate of 12.25 per cent, per annum (calculated pursuant to Clause 9.4 of the terms and conditions in the Bond Agreement) and is payable by the Issuer on the Interest Payment Date in April 2015.
iv. The Deferred Interest Payment and the payment of the additional interest set out above shall be made to such person who is entitled to receive the interest payment on the Interest Payment Date in April 2015;
v. no default or Event of Default is considered to have occurred in connection with the deferment of the interest payment or the other steps taken in accordance with the Proposal;

Background
PA Resources ("PA" or "the Company") has struggled to overcome its challenges inherited from several legacy issues, in particular related to the failed investment in Azurite that has led to the Company's recent financial difficulties
During 2013 PA's new management team addressed the Company's shortterm financing need by raising SEK 815 million in equity
As previously communicated, PA management has been working on a financing plan designed to bring the Company's portfolio of development assets into production
In preparation for the financing plan, management has taken several measures to reduce financing and execution risk, including:
» Maturing of development plans on key assets
» Completion of farm-outs in Denmark and Congo
» Agreement of farm-out of Tunisian offshore assets, subject to approvals
» Completion of the first comprehensive independent audit of PA Reserves and Contingent Resources
The financing plan will, in any event, require a significant amount of new equity to fund the field developments, and the Board expects that the Company's debt position will have to be addressed
However with continued uncertainty related to governmental approvals in Tunisia and the Company's overall debt position, equity capital is not currently available to PA
Therefore, the Company has examined ways of maintaining liquidity until the uncertainty in Tunisia is resolved and the financing plan can be executed

PA is unable to meet interest payments
Having analysed the current liquidity situation and mindful of its fiduciary duty of care to all stakeholders, the PA Board has decided to take necessary actions to preserve cash
PA has reviewed its operating and capital expenditures and are taking actions to reduce discretionary spend without disrupting ongoing business or future values of developments
PA has interest payments totalling USD 22 million due on its Working Capital Facility, Reserve Based Lending Facility, NOK bonds and SEK bonds in late September and early October, of which USD 21 million relates to the NOK and SEK bonds
The Board has concluded that the Company will not be able to settle these interest payments in cash and is proposing amendments to the bond agreements, such that the interest payment will be deferred until 5 April 2015
Gunvor, the Company's largest creditor through the secured RBL and working capital facilities, has confirmed that, subject to bondholder approval of the amendment proposals, it will roll up unpaid interest (in total USD 1 million) and future interest payments up to and including 31 March 2015
It is the view of PA's management and Board that a timely execution of the proposal is in the best interest of all PA's stakeholders
Approval of the proposed amendments will give PA necessary time to prepare and execute a long term financing plan following clarification of government approval processes in Tunisia, securing transparency on the future of PA Resources' key assets and developments

 PA purchased a 35% working interest (-41% paying interest) in the Azurite Field during the E&P boom in 2007
 A number of systematic failings were made by PA in making this acquisition
 Insufficient due diligence  Excessive paying interest relative to PAR'S financial capacity and ability to handle delay/cost increase
Fast-track deepwater development in 2008-2009 with an innovative and successful FDPSO concept led to first production in 2009  Substantial production disappointment due to subsurface under-performance
 Produced 16 mmbbl of FDP volume of 70 mmbbl  The field was abandoned in late 2013
 PA'S remaining obligations for Azurite:
All cost already charged to P&L Remaining cash payments from 1 Jan 2015 c. 16 MUSD Termination payments cease if the vessel is leased to a new user prior to May 2016 BWO is currently tendering the vessel for several new contracts

BACKGROUND AND CORPORATE UPDATE

In recent years, PA Resources has struggled to overcome challenges inherited from several legacy issues, in particular the failed investment in the Azurite field which resulted in material losses for the company and has led to the company's recent financial difficulties. During 2013 and 2014, the company with its new management has taken several measures to reduce financing and execution risk while progressing the company's asset portfolio, including:

· Raising SEK 815 million in new equity capital during 2013

· Maturing of development plans on key assets

· Completion of farm-outs in the company's assets in Denmark and the Republic of Congo and the farm-out agreement in the offshore Tunisian assets pending approvals

· Commissioned a third party review of Reserves and Contingent Resources by independent consultant firm ERC Equipoise ("ERCE")

As previously communicated, and in accordance with the plans presented in connection with the equity and bond financings in 2013, PA Resources is working to establish a financing plan for 2015 and onwards that addresses the funding of the material investments required to realise the value of its asset portfolio. It is the company's view that a significant amount of new equity is required in order to fund the planned operations through 2015 and beyond, and the board of the company expects that PA Resources' debt position will need to be addressed through the execution of the financing plan.

The scope of the financing plan is dependent on the outcome of ongoing government approval processes in Tunisia, concerning the company's farm-down transaction to EnQuest pic and a license extension on the company's Zarat license, which includes the Zarat and Elyssa fields. Due to the materiality of the assets related to these approvals, the company's view is that it is not able to raise new equity capital until further clarity is achieved in Tunisia. In the meantime, the company is examining ways of preserving liquidity and has taken actions in order to do so without disrupting ongoing business or future value of asset developments.

hr late September and early October the company has scheduled interest payments on its (i) Working Capital Facility ("WCF"), (ii) Reserve Based Lending ("RBL") facility, (iii) NOK bonds and (iv)

2

NORDIC TRUSTEE
SEK bonds (together the "Debt Facilities") amounting to a total of USD 22 million, whereof USD 21 million relates to interest payments on che Company's bonds (split USD 7 million and USD 14 million for the NOK and SEK bond issues respectively). Given its current liquidity position, the company will not be able to settle these interest payments in cash and hence proposes to defer all interest payments on all its Debt Facilities. The company has reached an agreement with its largest creditor and shareholder, the Gunvor Group, for the upcoming interest payments under the WCF and RBL facilities. Under this agreement, Gunvor accepts that all unpaid interest (in total USD 1 million) together with future interest payments will be rolled up to and including 31 March 2015. The agreement is however conditional upon the acceptance by the bondholders in the NOK and SEK bond issues of the proposed amendments which have been summoned for. It is the view of the company's management and board of directors that a timely execution of the proposal is in the best interest of all PA Resources' stakeholders. Approval of the proposed amendments will give the company necessary time to prepare and execute a long-term financing plan following clarification of government approval processes in Tunisia, securing transparency on the future of PA Resources' key assets and developments. For further details and Issuer update, reference is made to (i) stock exchange notices and press releases issued on the Issuer's website (www.paresources.se), (ii) the presentation attached to this Notice as Schedule 3. and (iii) the Issuer's unaudited Q2 2014 report published on 18 July 2014. The Holders are encouraged to review such infonnation and, if necessary, consult with the Issuer for any further details. 2. PROPOSAL FOR AMENDMENTS

Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Bonds on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).
The Agent recommends that you contact the securities firm that holds the Bonds on your behalf for assistance, if you wish to participate in the Written Procedure and do not know how your Bonds are registered or need authorization or other assistance to participate.
