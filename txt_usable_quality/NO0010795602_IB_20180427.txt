Report of the Independent Auditor (Translation of a report originally issued in Spanish - See Note 2b)
To
Shareholders and Directors Nova Austral S.A.
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Nova Austral S.A. and subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31,2017 and 2016, and the consolidated comprehensive income statements, consolidated statements of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Chile. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

If
Building a better working world
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Nova Austral S.A. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

The accounting principles of the Subsidiaries are changed when necessary so they are consistent with the principles of the Parent.

The acquisition of Subsidiaries is recorded using the acquisition method. The acquisition cost is the fair value of assets granted, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed as of exchange date.

Identifiable assets acquired and identifiable liabilities and contingencies assumed in a business combination are initially valued at fair value as of acquisition date. The acquisition cost excess on the fair value of the interests in net identifiable assets acquired is recognized as goodwill.

If the acquisition cost is lower than the fair value of net assets owned by the Subsidiary that is acquired, identification and measurement of assets, liabilities and identifiable contingent liabilities of the acquiree will be reconsidered, as well as in the acquisition cost measurement, the remaining difference will be recognized directly in the statement of comprehensive income.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles (Continued)
f) Basis of consolidation (continued)
ii) Loss of control
When control is lost, the Parent derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the Subsidiaries, non-controlling interests and other equity components related to the Subsidiaries. Any gain or loss resulting from the loss of control is recognized in income. If the Parent maintains interests in the prior Subsidiary, such interests will be valued at fair value as of the date in which control is lost. Subsequently, interests will be accounted for as investment using the equity method or as a financial asset available for sale depending on the level of influence maintained.
iii) Investments in associates and joint control entities (equity method).
Associates are entities where the Parent has a significant influence, but not control, on the financial and operating policies. A significant influence is deemed to exist when the Parent owns between 20% and 50% of the other entity's voting right. Joint ventures are entities where the Parent has joint control over its activities established in contractual agreements and strategic financial and operating decisions require the unanimous consent of the parties.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are recognized using the equity method and initially at cost. The investment cost includes transaction costs.
When the loss of the Parent exceeds its interests in an investment recognized using the equity method, the carrying amount of such interests, including any non-current investment, is reduced to zero and no other losses are recognized, unless the Parent has the obligation to make or has made payments on behalf of the company where it has interests.
iv) Joint control operations
A joint control operation is a joint venture where each partner uses its own funds to perform joint operations. The consolidated financial statements include the assets controlled by the Parent and the liabilities incurred by it in the course of joint ventures as well as the expenses incurred by the Parent and a portion of the revenues derived by it from the joint venture.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles (Continued)

f) Basis of consolidation (continued)

v) Transactions eliminated in the consolidation

Intercompany balances and transactions and any unrealized revenue or expense derived from intercompany transactions are eliminated in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized profits derived from transactions with companies whose investment is recognized using the equity method are eliminated from the investment in proportion to the interests of the Parent in the Company. Unrealized losses are eliminated using the same mechanism used in relation to unrealized profits.

g) Transactions in foreign currency and basis of conversion

Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar are deemed transactions in foreign currency and converted to the functional currency of the relevant entities as of the dates of transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency, other than the US dollar, as of reporting date are reconverted to the functional currency at the then current exchange rate. The profit or loss resulting from foreign currency translation, other than the US dollar, in monetary items is the difference between the amortized cost of the functional currency at the beginning of the period adjusted by interest and payments of the period and the amortized cost in foreign currency converted at the exchange rate at the end of the period.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, other than the US dollar, valued at fair value are reconverted to the functional currency at the exchange rate as of the date in which fair value was determined. Non-monetary items valued at historic cost in foreign currency are converted at the exchange rate as of the transaction date. Differences in foreign currencies, other than the US dollar, arising out of the reconversion are recognized in income, except for differences arising out of the reconversion of capital instruments available for sale, financial liabilities designated as the net investment hedge in operations carried out abroad, or qualified cash flow hedges, which are recognized directly in other comprehensive income.

Assets and liabilities in Chilean pesos (CLP), Euros and Unidades de Fomento (UF), have been converted to United States dollars (reporting currency, US$) at the exchange rates observed as of each closing date, as detailed below:

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (Translation of Financial Statements originally issued in Spanish - See note 2b)) Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles (Continued) h) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash, bank balances available and highly liquid assets maturing originally in less than three months, subject to not significant risk of changes in fair value and used by the Company to manage its current commitments. Cash and cash equivalents are recognized in the statement of financial position at amortized cost. i) Financial instruments i) Recognition The Company initially recognizes accounts receivable and other financial assets and financial liabilities as of the date they originated. Acquisitions and sales of financial assets are normally recognized as of negotiation date when the Company commits to acquire or sell the asset. All other assets and liabilities (including assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss) are recognized initially as of negotiation date when the Company becomes part of the instrument contractual provisions. A financial asset or liability is initially valued at fair value plus, in the case of an item not subsequently valued at fair value through profit and loss, transaction costs attributable directly to its acquisition or issue. ii) Derecognition Nova Austral S.A. and Subsidiaries derecognize a financial asset in the statem ent of financial position when the contractual rights on cash flows from the financial asset expire or when the financial asset is transferred in a transaction where substantially all risks and benefits of the financial asset ownership are transferred or where the corporate model does neither transfer nor retain substantially all risks and benefits of ownership and control on the financial asset is not retained.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (Translation of Financial Statements originally issued in Spanish - See note 2b))
Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles (Continued)
i) Financial instruments (continued)
ii) Derecognition (continued)
All interests in transferred financial assets that are created or retained by the Company are recognized as a separate asset or liability in the statement of financial position. When a financial asset is derecognized, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount assigned to the portion of the transferred asset) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any retained earnings or cumulative losses that have been recognized in the other statement of comprehensive income, is recognized in income.
In transactions where the Company does neither retain nor transfer substantially all risks and benefits of a financial asset ownership and retains control on it, the Company continues to recognize the asset to the extent it continuous to be part of it, which is determined as long as it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.
Nova Austral S.A. and Subsidiaries eliminate a financial asset when their contractual obligations are settled or expired.
iii) Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities may be offset so the net amount thereof is presented in the balance sheet when and only when the Company has the legal right to offset the amounts recognized and has the intention to liquidate the net amount or realize the asset and settle the liability at the same time.
Revenue and expenses are presented net only if allowed by the accounting standards or in case gains and losses arise out of a group of similar transactions to the negotiation activity of the Company.
iv) Valuation at amortized cost
The amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability is the initial measurement of such asset or liability less the reimbursements of principal plus or less the cumulative amortization calculated using the effective interest rate method of any difference between the initial amount and the reimbursement value as of expiration date and less any reduction due to impairment.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles (Continued)
i) Financial instruments (continued)
v) Fair value measurement
Fair value is the amount at which an asset may be exchanged or a liability settled by a willing and duly informed buyer and a seller in an arm's length transaction.
When available, Nova Austral S.A. and Subsidiaries estimate the fair value of an instrument using prices quoted in an active market for that instrument. A market is deemed active if prices quoted are easily and regularly available and represent real transactions that are performed regularly at arm's length.
If the market of a financial asset market is not active, Nova Austral S.A. and Subsidiaries will determine the fair value using a valuation technique. Valuation techniques include the use of recent market transactions between interested and duly informed parties acting in arm's length conditions, if available, as well as benchmarks such as, the fair value of another substantially similar financial asset, cash flow discounts, and option pricing models.
The best evidence of a financial asset fair value upon initial recognition is the transaction price, that is to say, the fair value of the consideration given or received, unless the fair value of that instrument may be better revealed by comparing it with other real market transactions involving the same instrument.
The Company has the following non-derivative financial assets: loans and receivables:
- Trade receivables and other accounts receivable
T rade receivables are the amounts owed by clients in relation to the sale of frozen and fresh finished products and are recognized at nominal value since average maturity terms are not greater than 90 days. Trade receivables are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently, estimates are made with respect to doubtful recovery accounts on the basis of an objective review of all outstanding amounts at the end of each period. Impairment losses relating to doubtful recovery credits are recorded in the statement of comprehensive income during the period they occur.
Other accounts receivable are comprised mainly of advances granted for the purchase of inputs with advance payment, portfolio checks and other receivables.

Fair value measurement (continued)

- Trade receivables and other accounts receivable (continued)

Specifically for trade receivables, other receivables and other accounts receivable, the nominal value was used, taking into consideration the short collection terms the Company manages.

vi) Impairment identification and measurement

Nova Austral S.A. and Subsidiaries evaluate any indication that financial assets not at fair value through profit and loss might be impaired as of each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired if there is objective evidence that an event triggering a loss has occurred after the asset initial recognition and such event has an impact on the future estimated cash flows of the financial asset that may be estimated reliably.

Objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired includes the significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer, lack of payment or default on the part of the borrower, loan restructuring or advance on the part of the Company in conditions that the Company would otherwise not consider, indications that a borrower or issuer is bankrupt, that an active market has disappeared for an instrument, or any other observable data related to the group of assets such as, adverse changes in the status of borrower's or issuer's payments included in the Company or the economic conditions that correlate to defaults on the assets of the Company.

The Company considers loan impairment evidence at the level of both a specific asset and a group of assets. All significant individual loans are tested for specific impairment and those not recognized as specifically impaired are subsequently tested for any indication of impairment that has occurred but not yet been identified. Loans that are not significant individually are tested together for impairment and grouped according to similar risk characteristics.

The default rate, the loss rate and the expected future recovery schedule are normally compared with actual results to ensure they continue to be appropriate. The Company writes-off certain loans when they are deemed bad loans. vii) Fair value through profit and loss Nova Austral S.A. and Subsidiaries have not designated assets at fair value through profit and loss that are managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis. viii) Obligations with banks and financial institutions Obligations with banks and financial institutions are accounted for based on the amortized cost using the effective rate method. In relation to such loans, it has been determined that there are no significant costs directly attributable to each loan that are incorporated to the effective rate, therefore no adjustments have been made in this category and the effective rate and the contract rate are the same.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (Translation of Financial Statements originally issued in Spanish - See note 2b)) Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles (Continued) j) Property, plant and equipment i) Recognition and measurement The items of property, plant and equipment are valued at cost less cumulative depreciation and impairment losses. The cost includes expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of assets built by the entity includes the cost of materials and direct manpower, any other cost directly attributable to the process of having the asset ready for the intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the place where they are located and the costs associated with capitalized loans. Costs may also include transfers from the equity of any gain or loss on qualified cash flow hedges of additions to property, plant and equipment. When the components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are recorded as separate items (important components) of property, plant and equipment. Proceeds and losses derived from the disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined comparing the revenue obtained in the sale with the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and the difference is recognized net in other revenue or other expenses in income. ii) Subsequent costs The cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized at carrying amount if it is probable that future economic benefits included in the component will flow to the Company and its cost may be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognized. Daily maintenance costs of property, plant and equipment are recognized in income when incurred.

iii) Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated on the depreciable amount that corresponds to the cost of an asset or other amount that is replaced by the cost less its residual value.

Depreciation is recognized in income based on the straight line depreciation method on the estimated useful lives. Leased assets are depreciated in the shortest period between the lease and the useful lives thereof, unless it is reasonably certain that the Company will own the assets at the end of the lease.

Land is not depreciated.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods, are detailed as follows:

Items of property, plant and equipment
Buildings and Constructions Machinery and equipment Fixed installations and accessories Other PPE

Minimum
useful life 5 2 5 2

Maximum

k) Intangible assets

Definite-lived intangible assets are recorded at cost less cumulative amortization and the impairment cumulative amount of items. Intangible assets generated internally, excluding development costs, are not capitalized and the expense is reflected in the statement of income in the period they are incurred.

i) Computer program acquisition and development costs

Acquisition and development costs of computer programs relevant to the Company are capitalized and amortized over the period in which they are expected to generate revenues from the use thereof and with a useful life of 60 months.

ii) Aquaculture concessions and water rights

Aquaculture concessions and water rights granted by the state and/or acquired from third parties are presented at historic cost. Those concessions and water rights have an indefinite useful life since they have no maturity date and the useful life thereof is not foreseeable, therefore they are not amortized. Indefinite useful life is reviewed in each period that has information available in order to determine whether the events and circumstances allow continuing to support the indefinite useful life evaluation for that asset. The useful life of concessions granted after April 2010 is 25 years, renewable; therefore, they are amortized over that period. Concessions and water rights are annually tested for impairment.

iii) Amortizations

Amortization of intangible assets with definite useful lives are calculated using the straight line method, allocating the acquisition cost less the estimated residual value and the estimated useful life. Amortization years for intangible assets are detailed as follows:

Information technology programs Licenses and software

between 2 and 5 years between 2 and 5 years

iv) Subsequent disbursements

Subsequent disbursements are capitalized only when they increase the future economic benefits incorporated in the specific asset related to such disbursements. All other disbursements, including disbursements to generate internal goodwill and marks, are recognized in income when they are incurred.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles (Continued)
l) Leased assets
Leases where the Company assumes substantially all risks and benefits of ownership are classified as financial leases in Property, Plant and Equipment. From the initial recognition, the leased asset is valued at the difference between the fair value and the present value of minimum lease payments, whichever is lower. The relevant lease obligations, net of deferred charges, are presented in other financial liabilities. After initial recognition, the asset is accounted for according to the applicable accounting principles. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company does not have assets under a financial lease agreement.
m) Biological assets
Biological assets include the following concepts: Biological assets, including groups or families of spawning fish, eggs, smolts and fish for fattening in the sea, are valued upon initial recognition and later, at fair value less the estimated costs in the point of sales, except when the fair value may not be determined reliably pursuant to the definitions of IAS 41. To that end, consideration shall be first given to the existence of an active market for these assets.
In consideration to the fact that there is no active market for live fish at all stages, the Company has considered the cumulative cost as of closing date less any associated impairment to valuate fish in fresh water (spawning fish, eggs, fry and smolts).
For fish at fattening stage, the valuation criteria is the fair value, which is the market fair value less the estimated transformation and sales costs.
This methodology consists in valuing fish over 1 kilogram, setting a price on the basis of the market price of the Company and then carrying it to the wfe basis. Mortality and costs to be incurred until harvest time estimates are made and the margin that will be obtained after discounting all relevant costs is determined based on such estimates. Subsequently, a percentage of that margin to be recognized is determined as of each period closing in proportion to the average weight of the biomass for each center in relation to the estimated harvest weight.
Fish under the weight indicated above are valued at cost less any associated impairment.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles (Continued)
m) Biological assets (continued)
Changes in fair value of biological assets are reflected in the statement of income for the period.
Biological assets maintained for fattening in sea water that will be harvested within the next twelve months, are classified as current biological assets and spawning fish, fry, fresh water smolts and fish at fattening stage to be harvested after twelve months, are classified as non current biological assets.
The profit or loss derived from the sale of these assets may vary with respect to the calculation at fair value at year end.
n) Income tax and deferred taxes
Nova Austral S.A. is exempt from income tax under Navarino Law No. 18.392 according to which tax benefits such as, Exemption from First Category Tax and a 20% Bonus for sales made within the national territory of goods produced in the exempted territory, will be granted for a period of 50 years. Therefore, taxes reflected in the financial statements correspond to those affecting its subsidiaries, Comercial Austral S.A. and Piscicultura Tierra del Fuego S.A.
Income tax expense is comprised of current taxes and deferred taxes. Current taxes and deferred taxes are recognized in income provided that they relate to a business combination or items recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Tax assets and liabilities for the current and previous years are measured according to the amount that is expected to be recovered from or paid to the fiscal authorities. Tax rates and fiscal regulations used to calculate such amounts are the rates and regulations in force as of years 2017 and 2016 closing, with a first category tax rate of 25.5% and 24%, respectively.
Deferred taxes are recognized on the basis of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the relevant fiscal bases thereof (known as temporary differences). Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences expected to increase future fiscal gains. Deferred tax assets are recognized for all temporary differences expected to reduce future fiscal gains and any unused tax loss or credit. Deferred tax assets are measured at the maximum amount that, based on the current or future estimated fiscal gains, it is probable that will be recovered. The net carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed as of each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current evaluation of future fiscal gains.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles (Continued)
n) Income tax and deferred taxes (continued)
Any adjustment is recognized in the income for the period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted at current value and are classified as non-current.
Deferred taxes are calculated according to the tax rates expected to apply to the tax gain (loss) of the periods in which the deferred tax asset is expected to be realized or the deferred tax liability settled on the basis of tax rates approved or whose approval process has almost concluded at the end of the reporting period.
Law No. 20780, Tax Reform, was published on September 29, 2014. This Law amends the taxation system and establishes two taxation regimes -attributed income and semi-integrated system- including a gradual increase in the first category tax rate. The income tax rate for 2014 increased to 21%, 22.5% for 2015, 24% for 2016, 25% (attributed income) or 25.5% (semi integrated) for 2017 and 25% rate under the attributed taxation system and 27% rate under the semi-integrated taxation system for 2018 thereafter. The Company selected to be taxed under the semi-integrated taxation system.
n) Inventory
Inventory is valued at cost or net realizable value, whichever is lower. Cost is determined using the weighted average price method (WAP).
The cost of finished products and in-process products includes the costs of raw materials, direct manpower, other direct costs and production overheads (based on a normal operating capacity), however, it does not include financing costs and foreign currency translation.
The net realizable value is the estimated sales price in the regular course of business less the estimated costs to complete production and/or put inventory in a sales condition. For reductions in the carrying amount of inventory at net realizable value, an estimate is made to devalue inventory charged to the income for the year in which those reductions occur.
o) Trade payables and other accounts payable
Trade payables and other accounts payable are recognized at nominal value since the average collection term is reduced and there is no material difference between this value and the fair value thereof.

These benefits mainly correspond to the vacation accrual. Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on a discounted basis and recognized as expenses as the related service is provided. r) Recognition of revenue and costs Revenue includes the fair value of considerations received or to be received for the sale of goods and services in the regular course of the Company's business. Revenue is presented net of sales tax, returns, reductions and discounts, if any, and after eliminating intercompany sales, if any. Nova Austral S.A. and Subsidiaries recognize revenue when its value may be valued reliably, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and the specific conditions for each and every activity of the Company are fulfilled, as described below: i) Sale of goods Sales revenue is recognized when the Company has transferred to a buyer the risks and benefits of the products of those goods and retains no right to dispose of them or effective control over them; normally, this means that sales are recorded when risks and benefits are transferred to clients in accordance with the terms stipulated in the commercial agreements. ii) Revenue from interest Revenue from interest is recognized at nominal value.

A service is deemed provided upon receipt and accepted by the client. iv) Costs and expenses Cost of sales, which is mostly the salmon production cost in frozen and fresh forms marketed by the Company, is recorded in the income for the year as of delivery date to the client, while sales are recognized at the same time. Other costs and expenses are recognized on the basis of the accrued principle, regardless of when they are paid and, if appropriate, during the same period in which related revenue is recognized. s) Impairment of non-financial assets Indefinite-lived assets are not subject to amortization. They are annually or when there is an indication of impairment, tested for impairment in order to ensure the carrying amount is not greater than the recoverable amount. Assets subject to amortization are tested for impairment losses, provided that an event or change in the circumstances indicates that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized on the asset carrying amount in excess of its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the fair value of an asset less the costs of sales or the value in use, whichever is higher. In order to evaluate impairment losses, assets are grouped at the lowest level so there are separate identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). Non-financial assets, other than investment lower value (Goodwill) that had suffered an impairment loss are reviewed as of each balance sheet date to check possible impairment reversals.

 IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments"
The final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued in July 2014, completing all phases of IASB project to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement. This standard includes new requirements based on principles for classification and measurement, introducing a "more prospective" model of expected credit losses for the accounting for impairment and a substantially new approach for hedge accounting. Entities have the option to early adopt the fair value change profit and loss accounting related to the "inherent credit risk" for financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, not applying the other two requirements established in IFRS 9. The standard is mandatorily effective for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted.
The Management of Nova Austral S.A. and Subsidiaries analyzed IFRS 9 from a quantitative and qualitative perspective and concluded that adoption of the new standard will have not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements the year this standard is first applied.
 IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers"
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was issued in May 2014. This is a new standard applicable to all contracts with customers, save for leases, financial instruments and insurance contracts. It is a joint project with FASB to eliminate differences in revenue recognition between IFRS and US GAAP. This new standard is intended to improve inconsistencies and weaknesses of IAS 18 and provide a model that will make comparability of companies in different industries and regions easier. It provides a new revenue recognition model and more detailed requirements applicable to multiple element contracts. In addition, it requires more detailed information. The standard is mandatorily effective for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted.
The Management of Nova Austral S.A. and Subsidiaries performed a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the possible effects the application of IFRS 15 might have on the consolidated financial statements and concluded that in consideration to the sales mechanism of the industry, the application of the new standard will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements the year this standard is first applied.

 IFRIC 22 "Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration"
IFRIC 22 addresses the mechanism to determine the transaction date in order to establish the exchange rate to be used upon the initial recognition of an asset, expense or related revenue (or the appropriate portion thereof), in the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability that results from the advance consideration payment or collection in foreign currency; for these purposes the transaction date corresponds to the initial recognition by the entity of such non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability that results from the advance consideration payment or collection. For multiple payments or receipts of advance considerations, the entity will determine a transaction date for each payment or receipt of each advance consideration.
This interpretation applies to annual periods beginning on January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted. If an entity applies this Interpretation to previous periods, it shall disclose it.
The Management of Nova Austral S.A. and Subsidiaries analyzed this interpretation from a qualitative and quantitative perspective and concluded that adoption of the new interpretation will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements the year it is first applied.
 IFRS 16 "Leases"
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases. IFRS 16 provides for the definition of lease agreement and specifies the accounting treatment of assets and liabilities arising out of these agreements from the perspective of the lessor and the lessee. The new standard is not significantly different than the previous one, IAS 17 Leases with respect to the accounting treatment from the perspective of the lessor. However, from the perspective of the lessee this new standard requires recognition of assets and liabilities regarding most lease agreements. IFRS 16 is mandatorily effective for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2019. Early application is permitted if adopted along with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The Management of Nova Austral S.A. and Subsidiaries is evaluating the impact the application of this new standard might have on the consolidated financial statements the year it is first applied.

This Interpretation applies to annual periods beginning on January 1, 2019. Nova Austral and Subsidiaries are evaluating the impact that might be triggered by the application of this interpretation.  IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts. This is a new comprehensive accounting standard for insurance contracts that covers the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. After its entry into force, it will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts issued in 2005. The new standard applies to all kinds of insurance contracts, regardless of the type of entity issuing them. IFRS 17 is effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021 and requires comparative figures. Early application is permitted if the entity also applies IFRS 9 and IFRS 5. Nova Austral and Subsidiaries are evaluating the impact the application of this new standard might have on the financial statements.

 IFRS 4 "Insurance Contracts" These amendments address concerns arising out of the application of new standards included in IFRS 9 before implementing new insurance contracts. The amendments introduce the following two options available to entities issuing insurance contracts: - The temporary and optional exemption from applying IFRS 9 for entities whose activities
predominantly relate to insurance. The exemption will allow entities to continue to apply IAS 39 Financial Instruments, Recognition and Measurement until January 1, 2021. - The overlay approach, which is an option for entities adopting IFRS 9 and issuing insurance contracts, to adjust profits or losses for specific financial assets; the adjustment eliminates volatility associated with the valuation of financial instruments that may result from applying IFRS 9, thus allowing these effects to be reclassified from profit or loss to other comprehensive income. The Management of Nova Austral S.A. and Subsidiaries evaluated these amendments and believes that adoption of this new standard will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements the year it is first applied.

 IAS 28 "Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures" This amendment clarifies that an entity that is a venture capital organization or any other qualifying entity, may decide upon initial recognition to value its investments in associates and joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss. If a non-investment entity has interests in an associate or joint venture that is an investment entity, it may decide to maintain the fair value measurement of its associate. Amendments must be applied retrospectively and they are effective on January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted. The Management of Nova Austral S.A. and Subsidiaries evaluated these amendments and believes that adoption of this new standard will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements the year it is first applied.

A change in Management's intended use of property does not constitute evidence of a change in use. Amendments must be applied prospectively and are effective on January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted. The Management of Nova Austral S.A. and Subsidiaries evaluated these amendments and believes that adoption of this new standard will not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements the year it is first applied.

Amendments apply to business combinations performed after January 1, 2019. Early application is permitted. Nova Austral and Subsidiaries will evaluate the impact of this amendment after it enters into force.  IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments - Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation" A debt instrument may be measured at amortized cost, cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, provided that contractual cash flows are principal and interest payments on the outstanding principal and the instrument is measured using the business model for this classification. Amendments to IFRS 9 intend to clarify that a financial asset meets the onlyprincipal-payments-plus-interest criteria, regardless of the event or circumstances causing the early termination of the contract or of the party paying or receiving the reasonable compensations for the contract early termination. Amendments to IFRS 9 will apply when prepayment is close to the principal unpaid amounts and interest so as to reflect the change in the referential interest rate. This means that prepayments at fair value or for an amount including the fair value of an associated hedge instrument cost, will normally satisfy the only-principal-payments-plus-interest criteria only if other elements of the change in fair value such as, the effects of credit risk or liquidity risk are not significant. The amendments must be applied retrospectively for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2019 and early application is permitted. Nova Austral and Subsidiaries will evaluate the impact of this amendment after it enters into force.

A party to a joint arrangement that has no joint control of a joint operation might obtain control if the activity of the joint operation is a business according to the definition of IFRS 3. Amendments clarify that interest previously held in that joint operation is not remeasured upon the operation. Amendments apply to transactions where joint control is acquired that are performed after January 1, 2019. Early application is permitted. Nova Austral and Subsidiaries will evaluate the impact of this amendment after it enters into force.
 IAS 12 Income Taxes The amendments clarify that income tax on dividends triggered by financial instruments classified as equity are more closely related to past transactions or events that triggered distributable gains than to distributions to the owners. Therefore, an entity recognizes the income tax on dividends in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity depending on where the entity originally recognized these past transactions or events. These amendments will apply to dividends recognized after January 1,2019. Nova Austral and Subsidiaries will evaluate the impact of this amendment after it enters into force.  IAS 23 Borrowing Costs The amendments clarify that an entity treats borrowings originally intended to develop a qualified asset as general borrowings when substantially all activities necessary to get the asset ready for use or sale are complete. Amendments are effective for periods beginning on January 1, 2019. Nova Austral and Subsidiaries will evaluate the impact of this amendment after it enters into force.

This clarification is relevant as it means the expected credit loss model described in IFRS 9 applies to this long term interest. Entities must apply the amendments retrospectively, with some exceptions. They are effective on January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted. Nova Austral and Subsidiaries will evaluate the impact of this amendment after it enters into force.
 IAS 28 "Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures" and IFRS 10 "Consolidated Financial Statements"
Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) address an inconsistency between IFRS 10 and IAS 28 requirements in connection with the treatment applicable to the sale and contribution of goods between an investor and its associate or joint venture. As established in the amendments issued in September 2014, when a transaction involves a business (in a subsidiary or not) a total profit or loss is recognized. A partial profit or loss is recognized when the transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, even when assets are situated in a subsidiary. The mandatory effective date of these amendments is to be determined since the IASB is planning to perform a thorough investigation that may result in a simplification of the accounting for associates and joint ventures. Immediate adoption is permitted. Nova Austral and Subsidiaries will evaluate the impact of this amendment after it enters into force.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles (Continued)
u) Accounting changes
For the period between January 1 and December 31,2017, the accounting standards have been applied uniformly in relation to prior periods presented and there are no changes that may have a significant effect on the interpretation of these consolidated financial statements.
Note 3 - Financial Risk Management
The Company is exposed to different financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow interest rate risk and market risk.
a) Credit risk
i) Risk of cash surplus investments
The Company has not taken any risks in relation to cash surplus that has been kept as cash equivalents with no instruments that may represent a risk for cash surplus.
ii) Risk derived from sales
The Company sales come from a highly diversified client portfolio, where clients are economically and geographically dispersed in countries with low sovereign risk rates (United States, European Union, mainly). In addition, credit operations are performed with clients that have a stable commercial relationship with the Company and a good payment history, together with a conservative credit policy. Theretofore, the Company believes its commercial operations do not expose it to a high risk. Also the history of the Company shows no significant bad debts associated with exports and/or domestic sales.
The Company has a very conservative credit policy, whereby most of sales are made with advances against documents, together with a risk hedge via a credit insurance that includes a great portion of the portfolio, and hence hedging the risk of client insolvency.
b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk occurs due to the mismatch between the cash needs (for operating, financing expenses and debt amortizations and investments in assets) and the fund availability (that results from client collection, redemption of cash equivalents and financing from other financial entities). Currently, the Company manages liquidity risk in a very conservative and prudent manner, keeping enough cash in its account and having enough lines of credit to avoid risks associated with securities.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (Translation of Financial Statements originally issued in Spanish - See note 2b)) Note 3 - Financial Risk Management (Continued)
c) Market risk i) Exchange rate risk The Company operates worldwide; therefore, it is exposed to the foreign exchange rate risk, mainly the US dollar. The exchange rate risk derives from business transactions carried out in other currencies, mainly Chilean pesos. The currency balance of the Company indicates that much of its revenue, main costs (salmon feed) and the financial debt are expressed in US dollars where the financial match occurs naturally, hence lowering the exposure to this risk. Nevertheless, there is a significant portion of operation and process costs associated with operations in Chilean pesos such as, salaries and wages and local services. While this exposure is real, the Company does not consider it very relevant and has not performed peso/dollar hedge operations. Notwithstanding, the Company is constantly monitoring the peso/dollar exchange rate fluctuations while keeping in mind a potential hedge in the future. ii) Interest rate risk The financial debt of the Company is in US dollars and has been 100% structured in the long term (non-current liabilities) save for accrued interest that corresponds to short term (current liabilities). Non-current debt consists of a bond maturing in May 2021 with 100% of principal payable upon the bond maturity and biannual accrued interest payments, agreed at a fixed interest rate of 8.25%. This debt is not subject to any covenant, but only to a restriction applicable to the distribution of dividends subject to 3.5% leverage as of 2017 closing that will be reduced to 2.5 until the bond maturity in May 2021. The financial debt structure is not exposed to rate fluctuations via a LIBOR increase. We do not see implicit rate risk in the current liability structure.

Note 3 - Financial Risk Management (Continued)
c) Market risk (continued)
iii) Sales price risk
Revenue from operating activities of the Company derives mainly from the sale of Atlantic salmon in all types, HON/HG salmon, Trim C/D/E fillets and portions, that as mentioned before, are mostly sold in foreign markets where prices are exposed to fluctuations in the world market as a result of worldwide supply and demand, terms of exchange agreed by the main producers and some political considerations and/or trade barriers. Our geographical, client and product diversification policy seeks to minimize price volatility risks. We also know that prices have a direct influence on the valuation of biological assets that are affected by the Fair Value estimate based on expected sales prices and production costs of the Company. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had a total of 10,286 Tons (live weight of fish) as biological assets subject to Fair Value.

(*) In 2017, significant delays in scheduled seeding occurred due to a change in the criteria of the Regulatory Entity (Sernapesca), which amended the environmental methodology and value to grant fish farms authorization to carry out the seeding process. Given the foregoing, our smolt breeding was seriously affected in terms of the biological process with extraordinary mortality and costs. This extraordinary non-recurrent event led us to make an adjustment amounting to ten million, two hundred and seventy three thousand dollars in current and non-current biological assets charged to other expenses by function.
