ISIN N0001030730.9 (NOK) and N0001030731.7 (USD) - Crew Gold Corporation Senior Secured Bond Issue 2006/2011 with Call Option
Oslo, 9 February 2009
Proposal in connection with a voluntary offer to convert NOK tranche to USD tranche - Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as Loan Trustee for the bond issue referred to as "Crew Gold Corporation Senior Secured Bond Issue 2006/2011 with Call Option" (the "Loan") which consists of a NOK tranche with ISIN NO001030730.9 (the "NOK Tranche") and a USD tranche with ISIN NO001030731.7 (the "USD Tranche"). The current par value of outstanding Bonds is NOK 325 million under the NOK Tranche and USD 50 million under the USD Tranche. The terms of the Loan are set out in a loan agreement dated 29 March 2006 (the "Loan Agreement").
All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Loan Agreement or the summons to this Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise stated.
Background
Based on a currency mismatch in the assets and liabilities of the Borrower, the Borrower wishes to hedge its currency exposure to a larger extent than they do today. The Borrower proposes to reduce its currency exposure through a voluntary offer (the "Voluntary Exchange Offer") to the Bondholders holding Bonds in the NOK Tranche ("NOK Tranche Bonds") to exchange their NOK Bonds for new Bonds in the USD Tranche ("USD Tranche Bonds").
The offer is described in further detail in the attached offer document. Bondholders of the NOK Tranche wishing to accept the Voluntary Exchange Offer should submit the attached offer acceptance form directly to Arctic Securities ASA, the manager for the Voluntary Exchange Offer.
A similar offer will be made to the bondholders o f the NOK convertible bond issue with ISIN N O 001029393.9 (the "NOK Convertible"). The Borrower plans to issue a new USD convertible on similar terms as those of the existing loan agreement for the NOK Convertible, although with an increase in the coupon by 0.50 percentage points as an incentive for accepting the offer.

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA

The Loan Agreement specifies a maximum amount that can be issued under the NOK Tranche

and the USD Tranche. The proposal implies reducing the amount issued under the NOK

Tranche with the aggregate nominal amount of the NOK Tranche Bonds tendered in the

Voluntary Exchange Offer while increasing the amount issued under the USD Tranche

correspondingly.

The NOK Tranche and the USD Tranche share a security package for the Loan consisting of a Guarantee from Crew Acquisition Corp. and a first priority pledge over the Guarantors shares in Guinor Gold Corporation (collectively the "Loan Security"). The Bondholders are therefore asked to accept that the Loan Security shall cover the increased USD Tranche (however, the NOK Tranche will be decreased).

The Loan Agreement restricts the Borrower's ability to issue additional Financial Indebtedness. The exchange of NOK Tranche Bonds and the conversion of the NOK Convertible into USD by issuing new USD bonds may be considered additional indebtedness under the Loan Agreement due to the change in currency exposure. The Bondholders are therefore asked to give their formal acceptance of such exchange and conversion.

As an incentive for exchanging NOK Tranche Bonds for USD Tranche Bonds, the Borrower offers to increase the Coupon of the USD Tranche by 0.50% p.a. from LIBOR + 5.00% p.a. to LIBOR + 5.50 % p.a. with effect from the next Interest Payment Date (30 March 2009).

To accommodate the exchange it is proposed that the face value of the USD Tranche Bonds shall be changed to USD 1.00 through a split of each USD Tranche Bonds with face value of USD 100,000 into 100,000 Bonds with face value o f USD 1 each.

Unless waived by the Borrower, the proposed changes to the Loan Agreement are subject to: the conditions for the voluntary conversion of bonds in the NOK Convertible being fulfilled or waived by the Borrower; the Board of Directors of the Borrower approves to complete the Voluntary Exchange Offer at the UDS/NOK rate determined in accordance with the Voluntary Exchange Offer.; and Bondholders accepting the Voluntary Exchange Offer for at least 25% of the outstanding Bonds in the NOK Tranche.

If the above conditions have not been satisfied or waived (as the case may be) by the Borrower by 27 February 2009, the Voluntary Exchange Offer will lapse.

For more detailed information, please contact Tom Hestnes at Arctic Securities ASA on +47 21 01 32 62 / tom.hestnes@arcticsec.no.

To enable the Borrower to conduct the proposed change o f the Loan Agreement, the Borrower has requested the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to consider the approval of the proposed changes.

In the opinion of the Loan Trustee the proposed Voluntary Exchange Offer will have the positive effect o f reducing the currency exposure of the Borrower, and as such reduce the risk for the Bondholders. It should be mentioned that, as the NOK Tranche and the USD Tranche shares a security package, a shift in the balance between the tranches will influence how the security coverage between the two tranches fluctuates with the USD/NOK exchange rate.

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
The Bondholders should independently evaluate the effect of the changed currency exposure on the Borrower, currency exposure on their Bond holdings, and currency exposure on the security package, as well as the offered increase in Margin for the USD Tranche, to evaluate whether they wish to facilitate the Voluntary Exchange Offer through a resolution on the Bondholders' Meeting. The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee.

At the Bondholders' meeting, each NOK Tranche Bond shall be weighted as one vote whereas each USD Tranche Bond shall be weighted as 1.31894 vote (reflecting the value in NOK of such USD Tranche Bond based on the exchange rate at the Disbursement Date, 30 March 2006).

Bondholders' meeting:

Bondholders are hereby summoned to a Bondholders' meeting:

The voting rights o f the USD Tranche Bonds shall be adjusted accordingly based on the exchange rate between USD and NOK on the exchange date.

b. the Board o f Directors o f the Borrower having approved to complete

In order to have a quorum, at least 2/10 of the voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting. If the proposal is not adopted, the Loan Agreement will remain unchanged.
Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds, and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.)
The individual bondholder may authorise Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Norsk Tillitsmann to vote, must then be returned to Norsk Tillitsmann in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to Norsk Tillitsmann, to notify Norsk Tillitsmann by telephone or by e-mail (at set out at the first page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the business day before the meeting takes place.

To the bondholders in: ISIN: NO 001 030730.9 - Crew Gold Corporation Senior Secured Bond Issue 2006/2011 with call option
Oslo, 9 February 2009
Voluntary Offer to exchange Bonds in the NOK Tranche for Bonds in the USD Tranche

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as Trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the above bond loan (the "Loan") issued by Crew Gold Corporation as borrower (the "Borrower"). The terms and conditions of the Loan are set out in the loan agreement dated 29 March 2006 (the "Loan Agreement"). Capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Loan Agreement unless otherwise defined in this voluntary offer (the "Voluntary Offer").
Arctic Securities ASA has been engaged by the Borrower as arranger (the "Arranger") for the Voluntary Offer. For more detailed information, Bondholders may contact Tom Hestnes at Arctic Securities on +47 21 01 32 62 / tom.hestnes@arcticsec.no.

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

The Borrower has a debt structure comprising four outstanding bond issues as described below:

Company NO 001024380.1 NO 0 0 1 0 2 9 3 9 3 .9 NO 0 0 1 0 3 0 7 3 0 .9 NO 0 0 1 0 3 0 7 3 1 .7

Amount 150,0

The book value of the Borrower's total assets was USD 1,052m as of 30 September 2008. Revenues and costs are predominantly in USD, whereas approximately 84% of the total bond debt is denominated in NOK. Therefore, there is a mismatch between the assets and revenue streams, and the debt liabilities. In order to better manage the currency exposure, the Borrower has explored alternative hedging strategies as it is in the best interest of all stakeholders that the Borrower's currency risk is minimised since this will contribute to the strengthening of the Borrower's credit worthiness.

HEDGING ALTERNATIVES

The Borrower has explored other alternatives in order to manage the currency exposure but has reached the conclusion that the most effective solution is to invite the current Bondholders to exchange their Bonds in the NOK Tranche ("NOK Tranche Bonds") for new Bonds in the USD Tranche ("USD Tranche Bonds") under the Loan Agreement. In order to preserve the interest of the Bondholders who cannot, or who are unwilling to, exchange their NOK Tranche Bonds for USD Tranche Bonds for legal or other reasons, the conversion is voluntary for each individual Bondholder in the NOK Tranche.

A similar offer is being made to the bondholders in the Senior Unsecured Convertible Bond Issue 2005/2010 (the "NOK Convertible Loan") issued with ISIN NO001029393.9 to convert their NOK

denominated bonds into USD denominated bonds to be issued under a new USD convertible loan (the "USD Convertible Loan").

THE VOLUNTARY OFFER

The holders of Bonds in the NOK Tranche are hereby invited to sell their current NOK Tranche Bonds to the Borrower at par with the consideration being committed and used for subscription to new USD Tranche Bonds at par. Accrued interest on the exchanged NOK Tranche Bonds as of the conversion date will be exchanged for interest on the corresponding USD Tranche Bonds from and including the previous Interest Payment Date (30 December 2008). The NOK Tranche Bonds acquired by the Borrower pursuant to this Voluntary Offer will be fully written down and the accepting Bondholders will receive new USD Tranche Bonds in an amount equal to the face value of the redeemed NOK Tranche Bonds divided by the the Exchange Rate (as defined below) at the Settlement Date. The Bond denomination of the USD Tranche will be changed from USD 100,000 to USD 1.00.

In consideration for the Bondholders accepting the exchange of NOK Tranche Bonds for USD Tranche Bonds, the coupon spread on the whole USD Tranche will at the next coupon date be increased by 0.50 percent. This means that the interest on the USD Tranche will be increased from 3 month USD LIBOR + 5.00 percent to 3 month USD LIBOR + 5.50 percent. The offered 0.50 percent constitutes a significant compensation for the conversion, considering that the conversion ultimately reduces the overall risk for the Bondholders on otherwise unchanged terms.

The exchange rate (the "Exchange Rate") shall be determined as the average of the official reference rate as published by the European Central Bank for the 5 (five) business days prior to the end of the Voluntary Offer period (meaning the average of the daily rates on each of the business days during the period from 12 February - 18 February 2009, both dates inclusive).

The date of the exchange of NOK Tranche Bonds for USD Tranche Bonds (the "Settlement Date") is expected to occur on or about 27 February 2009, provided that the Voluntary Offer is accepted by a sufficient number of NOK Bondholders and the following conditions are complied with:

(i) That the conditions for the voluntary conversion of bonds in the NOK Convertible Loan are fulfilled or waived by the Borrower on the terms of such offered conversion.

(ii) That the Borrower's issue of the USD Convertible Loan in connection with the offer to convert the NOK Convertible Loan is approved by the Bondholders of the Loan.

(ii) That the Board of Directors of the Borrower approves to complete the Voluntary Offer at the Exchange Rate..

(iii) That the Voluntary Offer is accepted in respect of no less than 25% of the outstanding NOK Tranche Bonds.

If the above conditions have not been satisfied or waived (as the case may be) by the Borrower prior to 27 February 2009, then the Voluntary Offer shall lapse.

RECOMMENDATION BY THE LOAN TRUSTEE

In the opinion of the Loan Trustee the proposed Voluntary Offer will have the positive effect of reducing the currency exposure of the Borrower, and as such reduce the risk for the Bondholders. It should be mentioned that, as the NOK Tranche and the USD Tranche shares a security package, a shift

in the balance between the tranches will influence how the security coverage between the two tranches fluctuates with the USD/NOK exchange rate.

The Bondholders must independently evaluate the effect of the changed currency exposure on the Borrower, currency exposure on their Bond holdings, and currency exposure on the security package, as well as the offered increase in Margin for the USD Tranche, to evaluate whether they wish to facilitate the Voluntary Offer through a resolution of the Bondholders' Meeting. The Voluntary Offer is put to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee.
