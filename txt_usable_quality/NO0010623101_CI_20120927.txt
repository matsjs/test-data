Status information to Bondholders
Dear Sir/ Madam
We would like to use this occasion to provide you with an update of the status regarding our vessel "Troll Solution".
The vessel is now completing its final preparation for acceptance testing by our client BP before leaving the Keppel Verolme yard for the West Sole field
The test encompasses a full jacking trial that is to be performed in the dry dock, to avoid the soft seabed soil condition prevailing in the yard harbors. The docking is scheduled for Sep.28 as the dry dock is currently occupied by another vessel.
BP will then need four days for acceptance testing of the vessel. Our dialogue with BP is very positive and both BP and NSDG are looking forward to leave the yard.
