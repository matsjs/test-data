Havila Shipping ASA Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2011/2017 ("HAYI06/07")

Oslo, 1 July 2016

Information to Bondholders - Redelivery of Drawn Bonds
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond" or the "Bond Issue") issued by Havila Shipping ASA as issuer (the "Company" or the "Issuer").
According to the Bond Agreements the Bondholders in both HAVI06 and HAVI07 were due to receive partial repayments as instalments on 30 June 2016 as described in clause 10.1.1 and 10.1.3 of the Bond Agreement (the "Instalments"). As a consequence of the Instalments the relevant Bonds have been drawn by the Securities Depository (the "Drawing"), and the drawn Bonds has changed status to a claim on the Company ("Drawn Bonds"). These Drawn Bonds do not appear as Bonds on the individual Bondholders securities accounts. This situation may cause some uncertainty with regards to the individual Bondholders' ability to prove then full holding with respect to the voting in future Bondholders' Meetings. The Bond Trustee and the Issuer have agreed to reinstate the situation to as it was prior to the Drawing of Bonds.
The Drawn Bonds will therefore be redelivered to the individual Bondholders securities account as ordinary Bonds ("Redelivery Bonds"). Technically such redelivery is done by way of the issuance of Redelivery Bonds in a ratio 1:1 which cancels the Drawn Bonds and reinstates the situation prior to the Drawing of the Bonds. The Redelivery Bonds will be delivered to the Bondholders owning the Drawn Bonds, and the Drawn Bonds will be discharged.
Please note that this is done solely in order to avoid going forward with uncertainty of the individual Bondholders' holding of Bonds, and with the added benefit for the Bondholders to regain tradable Bonds. This does not constitute settlement of the Instalments, and does not remedy this payment default. If the Bonds are accelerated the claim will include default interest on the Drawn Bonds from and including 30 June 2016. For the sake of good order, the Redelivery Bonds shall be an integral part o f the Bonds issued under HAVI06 and HAVI07.
The Redelivery Bonds is expected to be delivered to the registered holders of the Drawn Bonds as of end o f business 1 July 2016 on or about 4 July 2016.
Yours sincerely Nordic Trustee ASA
