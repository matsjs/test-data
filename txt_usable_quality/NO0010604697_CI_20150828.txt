BANKRUPTCY

1.

Initiation of bankruptcy proceedings

The Company was subjected to bankruptcy proceedings as a result of a ruling issued by the Aust-Agder

District Court on 24 April 2015. The order was issued at 11:00.a.m.

2.

Basis

On 12 December 2014, the Company submitted a petition to initiate debt negotiations (compulsory debt

settlement negotiations). The petition was officially accepted on 15 December 2014. Attorney-at-law

Jon Skj0rshammer was appointed as head of the debt committee.

After an overall assessment of the Company's liabilities and the framework established by the Bankruptcy Act § 30, during its meeting in April, the Company's board of directors concluded that it would not be possible to put forward a proposal for compulsory debt settlement that would be feasible to execute. The board then decided to suspend the debt negotiations.

The debt committee thereafter found no basis to continue working on a compulsory debt settlement. The Aust-Agder District Court was informed of the debt committee's conclusion in a report filed on 23 April 2015. Bankruptcy proceedings were then initiated pursuant the Bankruptcy Act § 57, first paragraph, number 1.

3.

Filing deadline

According to the Creditor's Recovery Act § 1-2, the filing deadline was 12 December 2014.

4.

The notification deadline for claims

At the outset of the bankruptcy proceedings, the deadline for reporting debt claims was set for 15 May

2015, cf. section 109 of the Insolvency Act.

The deadline is not preclusive. Subsequent debt claims will also be registered and subject to processing. For claims submitted after the deadline, the court in special circumstances might require the notifying party to compensate the bankruptcy review board for the specific costs incurred in examining the claim, because of its late submission, cf. the Bankruptcy Act § 115.

5.

Creditors' Meeting

The first creditors' meeting in the bankruptcy proceedings will take place on Friday, 22 May 2015, at

09:00 a.m. at the Aust-Agder District Court premises at Bl0dekj^r 3, in Arendal.

VI THE DEBTOR'S FINANCIAL OPERATIONS
1.1 The Company's operations, development, etc. The Company was formed in 1985 under the company name of O.W. Werner Engineering AS. The Company's scope of business operations was quite modest until 2004/2005.
The Company's business concept centered on the sale of engineering services and hire engineers and related service personnel. The company's primary focus centered on installing pipelines and cables on the seabed, which included welded steel pipes, flexible pipes, flexible composite pipes, umbilicals (pipes with control systems for satellite and platforms), etc. In connection with these contracts, crews were hired to come in and do the work, as well as the necessary equipment, including vessels. The scope of operations was relatively limited at the beginning.
In 2004, the Company secured a pipeline installation contract off the coast of Angola. The contract was completed according to the original plans and that activity was the start of what would become a comprehensive international pipe-laying operation at sea.
The Company gradually decided to acquire its own ships to achieve a more efficient and predictable level of operation and activity.
In 2007, the Company entered into a contract for 2 ships with the option of 2 additional ships with Chantier Naval Davie Inc., later Davie Yards Inc. ("Davie").

Law Firm Selmer DA

6/15

The investments were financed through [new] issues and the issuance of bonds and ordinary bank loans.
The Company was listed on Oslo Axess on 26 June 2007.
In the autumn of 2008, Davie experienced financial difficulty and initiated creditor negotiations. As a result, the Company experienced delays in their building schedule and an increase in the vessel price which in turn increased their need for capital.
After this, the ship construction went according to schedule, while the Company's level of activity steadily increased as well.
In 2010, Davie initiated composition negotiations in Canada. Negotiations were once again initiated with the Company to renegotiate the building contracts. The Company considered various options such as termination, change of shipyards, as well as various refinancing models, but chose to continue working with Davie. The composition negotiations lasted until 2013.
The situation with Davie significantly affected the Company's financial situation. In recent years, the Company has raised necessary capital in addition to restructuring the group. Throughout this period, the Company was an active participant in the bond market and was responsible for substantial borrowing. York Capital Management Global Advisors ("York") was an active consultant, participant and contributor in the restructuring process that took place.
In the summer of 2011, the Company founded Cecon B.V. in the Netherlands. Later, plans were made to establish subsidiaries in Brazil and England, the purpose of which was to achieve a better international operating structure for the company group.
In 2012, Cecon B.V. was awarded a major contract with Gas de France ("GDF") to be completed in 2013. The project developed in a positive direction at the outset but was significantly delayed as time passed. Under this contract, a number of additional projects were also completed, which reportedly were poorly documented. GDF refuses to cover the additional costs that were incurred. As a result of its dispute with GDF, Cecon B.V. struggled to make payments. Several major subcontractors initiated legal action against Cecon B.V. and the Company, which had issued parent guarantees for its subsidiaries' obligations. In December 2014 bankruptcy proceedings in Cecon B.V. commenced. The dispute related to the settlement with GDF is the underlying cause for the Company's financial problems, the previous debt negotiations, as well as the bankruptcy.
1.2 Further information about Cecon Contracting AS In 2013, the Company decided to transfer the operational activities of the Company to Cecon Contracting AS ("Cecon Contracting"). In line with this, the establishment of Cecon B.V. and the planned establishment of operating companies in Brazil and UK--the company would emerge as a pure holding company.
At the end of the third quarter of 2014, an agreement was reached wherein Cecon Contracting acquired the Company's plant and machinery, including necessary documentation and certifications, pipeline equipment, tools, etc., for USD 3.5 million. The plan was that this payment would be converted into share capital in the Company. At this point, the Company had substantial financial challenges, while the market for the Company's services was declining at the same time. There was uncertainty about the necessary valuation required in connection with the conversion, and as a result, the planned conversion was not completed.
Then, in December 2014, an agreement was signed between the Company and Rever Offshore to acquire 50.1% of the shares in Cecon Contracting, for USD 300,000.

Law Firm Selmer DA

7/15

Both contracts have been partially fulfilled by the Company and there are several unclear aspects with regard to said contracts. Among other things, it is not clear how the unfulfilled conversion was repaired, and whether or not it was indeed repaired. In regard to different valuations, it's not clear how these appear. This will be the subject of further investigations in the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.
2. Accounting and bookkeeping

2.1 Accounting The Company is compliant with accounting standards, pursuant to the Accounting Act, § 1-2, number 2 and corresponding regulations. The Company's bookkeeping obligations are established in the Bookkeeping Act § 2. Accounting is conducted internally. Ernst & Young AS has served as the Company's auditor.
The audit report for 2010, 2011 and 2013 noted the uncertainty surrounding the conditions for continued operation. In 2013, mention was made of the uncertainty related to the financing of the ship that was delivered from the shipyard in Canada, as well as uncertainty related to construction contracts in the Netherlands. The audit report for 2011 noted the uncertainty related to the completion of the ships.
The accounts are current and were up to date at the time bankruptcy proceedings began.
2.2 Registration The bankruptcy estate has full access to the Company's accounting system, Visma, in which documents were stored electronically from 2011-2015. The auditor has been given access to this system.

2.3 Profit and Loss Statement and Balance Sheet
The table below shows key figures for the past three years, including those from the bankruptcy initiation period, regarding the profit and loss statement reported for the Company (not the consolidated account statement):

In 2014, the Company's total operating revenue was NOK 9,780 thousand; while operating revenue for 2015 was NOK 1,312 thousand at the opening of bankruptcy. Revenue in 2014 and 2015 was mainly related to billing for management services and subleasing of consultants. The main income-generating operations for the group come primarily from the subsidiary Rever Offshore.

Of the total operating expenses for 2014, totalling NOK 36,239 thousand, project costs came to NOK 21,209 thousand, depreciation totalled NOK 238 thousand, bad debts totalled NOK 48,463 thousand, and labour costs totalled NOK 14,690 thousand. The Company also recorded a gain on the sale of assets, equalling NOK 23,891 thousand.

Law Firm Selmer DA

8/15

Net revenue for 2014 was negative, in the amount of NOK 56,689 thousand, which was partly due to interest on bonds, totalling NOK 20,980 thousand, and guarantees from the Company for the subsidiary Cecon B.V., NOK 31,505 thousand (USD 5 million). The Company experienced a net currency loss of NOK 6,329 thousand.

24.04.15* 229,455 98,604 129,612 228,216

Reduction in assets from 2012 to 2013 was mainly due to the change in the corporate structure. The Company sold its shares in shipping companies Cecon Shipping 1 AS - Shipping 3 AS to the subsidiary Rever Offshore, in 2013. During the course of that year, shares in Rever Offshore were also written down in the amount of NOK 65,700 thousand. Furthermore, the receivable in the subsidiary Cecon B.V. was written down for NOK 14,820 thousand.

Assets at the time of bankruptcy consisted mainly of investments in the subsidiary Rever Offshore, which after write-downs have a recorded value of NOK 201,784 thousand. Furthermore, a receivable in the amount of NOK 28,400 thousand was recorded for the subsidiary Cecon Contracting. The receivable came about in the fall of 2014 as a result of equipment that the Company sold to Cecon Contracting. The plan was that the subsidiary's receivables would be converted into shares, but the conversion did not materialize.

Of the total liabilities at the time of bankruptcy, bonds amounted to approximately NOK 48,940 thousand. The loan is secured by shares in Rever Offshore. Total accounts payable amount in 2014 is NOK 45,801 thousand. Guarantees provided to subsidiary Cecon B.V. by the Company are recorded as part of the total accounts payable, and equal NOK 31,505 thousand.

Plant and machinery The Company owns plant and machinery consisting of various pieces of office equipment. The estimated value is approximately NOK 75,000. The plant and machinery are pledged in favour of Nordic Trustee and abandoned by the committee, as the claim exceeds the estimated value.

Claims against Group companies As of 31 December 2014, recorded claims totalled NOK 14.8 million in Cecon B.V.

At the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, the recorded receivable for Cecon Contracting was NOK 32.6 million, including currency adjustments. The recorded receivable is related to the sale of the Company's plant and machinery to Cecon Contracting. Reference is made here to point VI (1.2) of the report.

VIII CREDITORS' CURRENT STATUS

1.

Ability to provide coverage

Until now, no assets in the have been found which could cover the Company's unsecured creditors.

2.

Claim Review

In order to safeguard creditors' rights, and to assess whether there is any information of interest to the

bankruptcy proceedings, submitted claims will be reviewed as they arrive at the office of the bankruptcy

administrative committee. No action will be recommended in the case of claims in which it has become

apparent that the claim will not be covered in the bankruptcy administrative committee, cf. Bankruptcy

Act § 110, third paragraph. The bankruptcy estate will inform claimants whose receivables are not

selected. Creditors wanting further information on the submitted claims, or who wish to review the list

of receivables, can access this by contacting the bankruptcy estate, cf. Bankruptcy Act § 110, fourth

paragraph.

3.

Limitation periods

Statutory limitations on claims that were reported to the estate by the reporting deadline will be

discontinued, cf. Limitation Act § 18, No. 2. In the case of unsecured claims, the effect of the

discontinuation will only last for a period of one year after the termination of the bankruptcy

proceedings, cf. the Limitation Act, § 22, No. 2.

IX

POSSIBLE OFFENSES AND SANCTIONS IN REGARD TO THE COMPANY'S AUDITOR

Thus far, the bankruptcy proceedings have especially focused on gathering information and documentation. A further review of existing documentation, as well as obtaining additional documentation, will take place in order to determine whether there are any criminal offenses.

Thus far, there are no grounds to report the Company's auditor to the Financial Supervisory Authority.

X

GROUNDS FOR SUSPENSION

The bankruptcy estate will return to this question once further investigation has taken place.

XI

PERSPECTIVE - BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS UNDERTAKEN - SCHEDULE

1. Bankruptcy proceedings that have been undertaken In connection with the previous debt negotiations, the estate was provided with information regarding the group's business activities, obligations and rights. Therefore, the focus of the estate following the bankruptcy has mostly consisted of routine tasks associated with cleaning up and discontinuation of the Company's business operations.

An inspection and asset registration has taken place, as well as meetings with the Company's local management where additional practical matters related to the Company's operations, assets, liabilities, organization, etc., were reviewed.

The bankruptcy estate has also held meetings with the Company's chairman. There has also been correspondence with regards follow-up questions.

Law Firm Selmer DA

12/15

Known creditors, other banks, public institutions and public records of various kinds have been notified, in particular for the purpose of identifying potential assets and voidable transactions, or conduct satisfying disqualification under the Bankruptcy Act or violations of criminal statutes.

The Company's bank has been notified. The estate has demanded bank statements and transaction overviews. A review of submitted documentation has begun.

Contact has been made with the Company's accountant and auditor. A review of the current accounting records has begun.

The Company's employees were notified of their dismissal by the estate and of the estate's non accession to employee contracts. The employees were notified in writing of their rights according to the national wage protection plan. The estate currently handles wage claims and wage-guarantee applications.

Contact has been made with the lessor of the Company's office premises in order to clarify practical issues regarding the lease. The estate has reported non-accession to the lease agreement, cf. the Creditors Recovery Act, § 7-10.

The estate is receiving and handling communication from the Company's creditors.

The estate has handled various inquiries from creditors who have current agreements with the Company.

Prior to debt negotiations, a motor vehicle and various bank accounts belonging to the Company were attached. The basis for the claim and the attachments was unclear for a long time and the estate has spent a considerable amount of time to clarify the circumstances surrounding the claim. The funds in question have now been released and the car has been liquidated in consultation with the party responsible for the attachment.

The Company's plant and machinery have been abandoned.

Rever Offshore would like to purchase the Company's shares in Cecon Contracting, the Company's claim against Cecon Contracting, the secured claim against Cecon B.V., as well as a general right to enter into current contracts. Negotiations in this regard are ongoing.

2.

Further bankruptcy proceedings

There are still many tasks to accomplish before the bankruptcy proceedings can be concluded. Further

work will concentrate on the following:

Review of the Company's financial statements and documentation that were received, in order to reveal possible further assets and any voidable transactions or conduct subject to civil liability.

Liquidation of the Company's assets.

Further inquiries will be made in order to determine whether the Company can be reimbursed for tax and/or VAT.

Follow-up work on the wage-guarantee applications.

It is still too early to comment on whether the bankruptcy proceedings can be expected to end. If the bankruptcy proceedings cannot be terminated within three months from today's date, the estate will provide a report to the court with an explanation regarding subsequent bankruptcy proceedings and status of the proceedings.
