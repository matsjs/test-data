Terms used herein shall be deemed to be defined as such for the purposes of the Conditions set forth in the Prospectus dated 25 June 2007 which constitutes a base prospectus for the purposes of Directive 2003/71/EC (the "Prospectus Directive"). This document constitutes the Final Terms of the Covered Bonds described herein for the purposes of Article 5.4 of the Prospectus Directive and must be read in conjunction with the Prospectus. Full information on the Issuer and the offer of the Covered Bonds is only available on the basis of the combination of these Final Terms and the Prospectus.

On 27 January 2012 the Final Terms were amended to reflect i) the de-listing of the Covered Bonds from the regulated market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and ii) the listing of the Covered Bonds on the Oslo Børs. The reason for the amendment was that listing on the Oslo Børs was considered as more convenient among certain Covered Bondholders than listing on the regulated market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

For listing purposes the Final Terms should also be read in conjunction to the Base Prospectus dated 17 June 2011 as amended.

3. Interest
(a) Interest on Fixed Rate Covered Bonds
Each Fixed Rate Covered Bond bears interest on its outstanding nominal amount (or, if it is a Partly Paid Covered Bond, the amount paid up) from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date at the rate(s) per annum equal to the Rate(s) of Interest. Interest will be payable in arrear on the interest Payment Date(s) in each year up to (and including) the Maturity Date.
Except as provided in the applicable Final Terms, the amount of interest payable on each Interest Payment Date in respect of the Fixed Interest Period ending on (but excluding) such date will amount to the Fixed Coupon Amount. Payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date will, if so specified in the applicable Final Terms, amount to the Broken Amount(s) so specified.
As used in these Terms and Conditions, "Fixed Interest Period" means the period from (and including) an Interest Payment Date (or the Interest Commencement Date) to (but excluding) the next (or first) Interest Payment Date.
If interest is required to be calculated for a period other than a Fixed Interest Period or if no Fixed Coupon Amount is specified in the applicable Final Terms, such interest shall be calculated by applying the Rate of Interest to each Calculation Amount, multiplying such sum by the applicable Day Count Fraction, and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest sub-unit of the relevant Specified Currency, half of any such sub-unit being rounded upwards or otherwise in accordance with applicable market convention.
"Day Count Fraction" means, in respect of the calculation of an amount of interest in accordance with this Condition 3 (a)\
(i) if "Actual/Actual (ICMA)" is specified in the applicable Final Terms:
(a) in the case of Covered Bonds where the number of days in the relevant period from (and including) the most recent Interest Payment Date (or, if none, the Interest Commencement Date) to (but excluding) the relevant payment date (the "Accrual Period") is equal to or shorter than the Determination Period during which the Accrual Period ends, the number of days in such Accrual Period divided by the product of (1) the number of days in such Determination Period and (2) the number of Determination Dates (as specified in the applicable Final Terms) that would occur in one calendar year; or
(b) in the case of Covered Bonds where the Accrual Period is longer than the Determination Period during which the Accrual Period ends, the sum of:
(1) the number of days in such Accrual Period falling in the Determination Period in which the Accrual Period begins divided by the product of (x) the number of days in such Determination Period and (y) the number of Determination Dates (as specified in the applicable Final Terms) that would occur in one calendar year; and
(2) the number of days in such Accrual Period falling in the next Determination Period divided by the product of (x) the number of days in such Determination Period and (y) the number of Determination Dates that would occur in one calendar year; and
(ii) if "30/360" is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the number of days in the period from (and including) the most recent Interest Payment Date (or, if none, the Interest Commencement Date) to (but excluding) the relevant payment date (such number of days being calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days with 12 30-day months) divided by 360.
44

In these Terms and Conditions:
"Determination Period" means the period from (and including) a Determination Date to (but excluding) the next Determination Date (including, where either the Interest Commencement Date or the final Interest Payment Date is not a Determination Date, the period commencing on the first Determination Date prior to, and ending on the first Determination Date falling after, such date); and
"sub-unit" means, with respect to any currency other than euro, the lowest amount of such currency that is available as legal tender in the country of such currency and, with respect to euro, means one cent.
(b) Interest on Floating Rate Covered Bonds and index Linked Interest Covered Bonds (i) Interest Payment Dates

(A) the Specified Interest Payment Date(s) in each year specified in the applicable Final Terms; or
(B) if no Specified Interest Payment Date(s) is/are specified in the applicable Final Terms, each date (each such date, together with each Specified Interest Payment Date, an "Interest Payment Date") which falls the number of months or other period specified as the Specified Period in the applicable Final Terms after the preceding interest Payment Date or, in the case of the first interest Payment Date, after the Interest Commencement Date.
Such interest will be payable in respect of each interest Period (which expression shall, in these Terms and Conditions, mean the period from (and including) an Interest Payment Date (or the Interest Commencement Date) to (but excluding) the next (or first) Interest Payment Date).
If a Business Day Convention is specified in the applicable Final Terms and (x) if there is no numericaiiy corresponding day in the calendar month in which an Interest Payment Date should occur or (y) if any Interest Payment Date would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day, then, if the Business Day Convention specified is:
(1) in any case where Specified Periods are specified in accordance with Condition 3(b)(1)(B) above, the Floating Rate Convention, such Interest Payment Date (i) in the case of (x) above, shall be the last day that is a Business Day in the relevant month and the provisions of (B) below shall apply mutatis mutandis or (ii) in the case of (y) above, shall be postponed to the next day which is a Business Day unless it would thereby fail into the next calendar month, in which event (A) such Interest Payment Date shall be brought forward to the immediately preceding Business Day and (B) each subsequent interest Payment Date shail be the last Business Day in the month which fails the Specified Period after the preceding applicable Interest Payment Date occurred; or

(A) ISDA Determination for Floating Rate Covered Bonds
Where ISDA Determination is specified in the applicable Final Terms as the manner in which the Rate of interest is to be determined, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Period will be the relevant ISDA Rate plus or minus (as indicated in the applicable Final Terms) the Margin (if any). For the purposes of this subparagraph (A), "ISDA Rate" for an Interest Period means a rate equal to the Floating Rate that would be determined by the Fiscal Agent or, where the applicable Final Terms specifies a Calculation Agent, the Calculation Agent under an interest rate swap transaction if the Fiscal Agent or, where the applicable Final Terms specifies a Calculation Agent, the Calculation Agent were acting as Calculation Agent (as such term is defined in the ISDA Definitions) for that swap transaction under the terms of an agreement incorporating the 2000 ISDA Definitions, as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. and as amended and updated as at the Issue Date of the first Tranche of the Covered Bonds (the "ISDA Definitions") and under which:
(1) the Floating Rate Option is as specified in the applicable Final Terms;
(2) the Designated Maturity is a period specified in the applicable Final Terms; and
(3) the relevant Reset Date is either (i) if the applicable Floating Rate Option is based on the London inter-bank offered rate ("LIBOR") or on the Euro-zone inter-bank offered rate ("EURiBOR") the first day of that Interest Period or (ii) in any other case, as specified in the applicable Final Terms.
For the purposes of this sub-paragraph (A), "Floating Rate", "Floating Rate Option", "Designated Maturity" and "Reset Date" have the meanings given to those terms in the ISDA Definitions.
(B) Screen Rate Determination for Floating Rate Covered Bonds
Where Screen Rate Determination is specified in the applicable Final Terms as the manner in which the Rate of interest is to be determined, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Period will, subject as provided below, be either:
(1) the offered quotation; or
(2) the arithmetic mean (rounded if necessary to the fifth decimal place, with 0.000005 being rounded upwards) of the offered quotations,
(expressed as a percentage rate per annum) for the Reference Rate which appears or appear, as the case may be, on the Relevant Screen Page as at the Specified Time on the Interest Determination Date in question plus or minus (as indicated in the applicable Final Terms) the Margin (if any), all as determined by the Fiscal Agent or, where the applicable Final Terms specifies a Calculation Agent, the Calculation Agent. If five or more of such offered quotations are available on the Relevant Screen Page, the highest (or, if there is more than one such highest quotation, one only of such quotations) and the lowest (or, if there is more than one such lowest quotation, one only of such quotations) shall be disregarded by
46

the Fiscal Agent or, where the applicable Final Terms specifies a Calculation Agent, the Calculation Agent for the purpose of determining the arithmetic mean (rounded as provided above) of such offered quotations.
The Agency Agreement contains provisions for determining the Rate of Interest in the event that the Relevant Screen Page is not available or If, in the case of (1) above, no such offered quotation appears or, in the case of (2) above, fewer than three such offered quotations appear, in each case as at the Specified Time.
If the Reference Rate from time to time in respect of Floating Rate Covered Bonds is specified in the applicable Final Terms as being other than LIBOR or EURIBOR, the Rate of interest in respect of such Covered Bonds will be determined as provided in the applicable Final Terms.
(iii) Minimum Rate of Interest and/or Maximum Rate of Interest
If the applicable Final Terms specifies a Minimum Rate of Interest for any Interest Period, then, in the event that the Rate of Interest in respect of such Interest Period determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (ii) above is less than such Minimum Rate of Interest, the Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall be such Minimum Rate of Interest.
If the applicable Final Terms specifies a Maximum Rate of Interest for any Interest Period, then, in the event that the Rate of Interest in respect of such Interest Period determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (ii) above is greater than such Maximum Rate of Interest, the Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall be such Maximum Rate of Interest Rate.
(iv) Determination of Rate of Interest and Calculation of Interest Amounts
The Fiscal Agent or, where the applicable Final Terms specifies a Calculation Agent, the Calculation Agent will at or as soon as practicable after each time at which the Rate of Interest is to be determined, determine the Rate of Interest for the relevant Interest Period.
The Fiscal Agent or, where the applicable Final Terms specifies a Calculation Agent, the Calculation Agent will calculate the amount of interest (the "Interest Amount") payable per Calculation Amount in respect of the Floating Rate Covered Bonds or Index Linked Interest Covered Bonds for the relevant Interest Period. Each Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Rate of interest to the Calculation Amount, multiplying such sum by the applicable Day Count Fraction, and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest sub-unit of the relevant Specified Currency, half of any such sub-unit being rounded upwards or otherwise in accordance with applicable market convention.
"Day Count Fraction" means, in respect of the calculation of an amount of interest in accordance with this Condition 3(b):
(i) if ``ActuaS/365" or " Actual/Actual" is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the actual number of days in the interest Period divided by 365 (or, if any portion of that Interest Period falls in a leap year, the sum of (A) the actual number of days in that portion of the Interest Period failing in a leap year divided by 366 and (B) the actual number of days in that portion of the Interest Period falling in a non-leap year divided by 365);
(ii) if "Actual/365 (Fixed)" is specified in the applicabie Final Terms, the actual number of days in the Interest Period divided by 365;

(v) if "30/360" , " 360/360" or " Bond Basis" is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the number of days in the Interest Period divided by 360 (the number of days to be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days with 12 30-day months (unless (a) the last day of the Interest Period is the 31st day of a month but the first day of the Interest Period is a day other than the 30th or 31st day of a month, in which
47

case the month that includes that last day shall not be considered to be shortened to a 30-day month, or (b) the last day of the interest Period is the last day of the month of February, in which case the month of February shall not be considered to be lengthened to a 30-day month)); and
(vi) if " 30E/360" or " Eurobond Basis" Is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the number of days in the Interest Period divided by 360 (the number of days to be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days with 12 30-day months, without regard to the date of the first day or last day of the Interest Period unless, in the case of the final Interest Period, the Maturity Date is the last day of the month of February, in which case the month of February shall not be considered to be lengthened to a 30-day month).
(v) Notification of Rate of Interest and Interest Amounts
The Fiscal Agent or, where the applicable Final Terms specifies a Calculation Agent, the Calculation Agent will cause the Rate of Interest and each Interest Amount for each Interest Period and the relevant Interest Payment Date to be notified to the Issuer, the Fiscal Agent, each of the other Paying Agents, the Covered Bondholders and any stock exchange on which the relevant Floating Rate Covered Bonds or Index Linked Interest Covered Bonds are for the time being listed and, in the case of VPS Covered Bonds, the VPS and the VPS Account Manager (by no later than the first day of each Interest Period) and notice thereof to be published in accordance with Condition 13 (Notices) as soon as possible after their determination but in no event later than the fourth London Business Day (as defined below) thereafter, Each Interest Amount and Interest Payment Date so notified may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made by way of adjustment) without prior notice in the event of an extension or shortening of the interest Period. Any such amendment will be promptly notified to each stock exchange on which the relevant Floating Rate Covered Bonds or Index Linked Interest Covered Bonds are for the time being listed and to the Covered Bondholders in accordance with Condition 13 (Notices). For the purposes of this paragraph, the expression "London Business Day" means a day (other than a Saturday or a Sunday) on which banks and foreign exchange markets are open for general business in London.
(vi) Determination or Calculation by Fiscal Agent

The aggregate nominal amount of Redeemed Covered Bonds represented by definitive Covered Bonds shall bear the same proportion to the aggregate nominal amount of all Redeemed Covered Bonds as the aggregate nominal amount of definitive Covered Bonds outstanding bears to the aggregate nominal amount of the Covered Bonds outstanding, in each case on the Selection Date, provided that such first mentioned nominal amount shall, if necessary, be rounded downwards to the nearest integral multiple of the Calculation Amount, and the aggregate nominal amount of Redeemed Covered Bonds represented by a global Covered Bond shall be equal to the balance of the Redeemed Covered Bonds. No exchange of the relevant global Covered Bond will be permitted during the period from (and including) the Selection Date to (and including) the date fixed for redemption pursuant to this paragraph (c) and notice to that effect shall be given by the Issuer to the Covered Bondholders in accordance with Condition 13 (Notices) at least 5 days prior to the Selection Date,

Where this Condition 5(A) applies, any failure to redeem the Covered Bonds on the Maturity Date or any extension of the maturity of Covered Bonds under this Condition 5(A) shall not constitute an event of default for any purpose or give any Covered Bondholder any right to receive any payment of interest, principal or otherwise on the relevant Covered Bonds other than as expressly set out in these Terms and Conditions.
(v) In the event of the extension of the maturity of Covered Bonds under this Condition 5(A), interest rates, interest periods and interest payment dates on the Covered Bonds from (and including) the Maturity Date to (but excluding) the Extended Maturity Date shall be determined and made in accordance with the applicable Final Terms and Condition 3(0 (Interest Rate and Payments from the Maturity Date in the event of extension of Maturity of the Covered Bonds up to the Extended Maturity Date).
