To the bondholders of ISIN NO 001 037581.9 11.00 per cent Mosvold Supply Pic Callable Bond Issue 2007 / 20012

Oslo, 27 October 2009

AMENDMENT PROPOSAL - SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed as trustee in the above mentioned bond issued by Mosvold Supply Pic. (the "Borrower" or "Mosvold").
All capitalized terms used in these summons shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement dated 28 June 2007 or these summons unless otherwise stated.
The information in this summons and the attachments regarding the legal, operational and financial status of the Borrower is provided by the Borrower. The Loan Trustee disclaims any and all liability related to any information provided by the Borrower.

1.

PROPOSAL AND RATIONALE

The Borrower has requested that a Bondholders' meeting be called to consider the following proposal:

· The Loan Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) is granted second priority security in Hull 7049 on the same terms as is now granted in relation to Hull 7047. Going forward after a cancellation of the construction contract for Hull 7047, the Bondholders will therefore be essentially in the same security position as they are today with security in two Vessels. This implies that the new bondholder security in Hull 7049 would rank behind the same first priority security for a loan of USD 112.000. 000 plus interest and expenses as has preference in relation to Hull 7047 and Hull 7048 today.

· The Loan Agreement is varied so that upon termination of the construction contract for Hull 7047 and receipt by the Borrower from the Yard of the refund of the pre delivery instalments paid in relation to Hull 7047, the Borrower shall redeem 25% of the Remaining Bond at a redemption value of 106% of par value.

· Upon a sale or termination of the construction contracts for Hull 7048 or Hull 7049 the Borrower shall redeem 50% of the Remaining Loan at the same redemption values set out in the current Loan Agreement. The entire Remaining Loan will after the redemption described above in relation to Hull 7047 as a maximum be NOK 138.750.000.

The background to the proposal is further described in the attached letter from the Borrower.

In the opinion of the Borrower the proposal has the following advantages:

· The Bondholders will receive redemption of 25% of the Remaining Loan now, rather than having to wait until May 2010 at the earliest (assuming that the Vessel will be delayed beyond the cancelling date) and that Mosvold in such case takes the decision to cancel;

· The Borrower and thereby indirectly the Bondholders will avoid the risk of a potential dispute with the Yard in May 2010 whether the conditions for cancelling of the construction contract has been fulfilled at such time and whether the Borrower is entitled to a refund of the pre-delivery instalments;
· The Bondholders' security position will essentially be the same as today and not disadvantaged;
· The Borrower is able to use part of the funds refunded by the Yard upon the cancellation of Hull 7047 to fund further pre-delivery instalments on Hulls 7049 and 7050. This will reduce the additional financing which the Borrower is required to obtain (which will be on better priority than the Bonds) and also postpone the deadline for by when such additional financing will have to be in place.
On this basis it is the Borrower's view that the proposal is beneficial both to the Borrower and to the Bondholders.
The Borrower has approached a number of Bondholders on an informal basis in relation to this proposal and has received their support.
The Loan Trustee's evaluation:

The Loan Trustee put forward the Proposal without any further evaluations or recommendations.

The Bondholders must independently evaluate, based on available information, whether the Proposal is acceptable. It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from tax and other advisors regarding the effects and possible consequences of the Proposal.

To approve the resolutions, bondholders representing at least 2/3 of the Bonds represented in person or by proxy must vote in favour of the resolutions. In order to have a quorum, at least 5/10 of the voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting. If the proposal is not adopted the Loan Agreement will remain unchanged. Please find attached a bondholders' form from the Securities Depository (VPS) ("Bondholder's Form") indicating your bondholding at the date of printing of these summons. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' Meeting. (If the Bonds are held in custody - i.e. the beneficial bondholder is not indicated directly in the Bondholder's Form, the custodian must confirm, (i) the owner of the Bonds (ii) aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds owned by such bondholder and (iii) the account number in the Securities Depository as reflected on the Bondholders' Form on which the relevant Bonds are registered. The individual bondholder may authorize the Loan Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form will serve as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form authorizing the Loan Trustee to vote must then be returned to the Loan Trustee in due time before the meeting (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see first page of this letter for further details). In the event the Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was issued, the new bondholder must bring to the bondholder's meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Loan Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds. For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' meeting either in person or by proxy other than to the Loan Trustee to notify the Loan Trustee by telephone or e-mail (as set out on the first page of this letter) no later than 16:00 hours (4 pm) Oslo time the banking day immediately prior to the day of the meeting.

Amendment proposal - Background for request to summon bondholders' meeting
We refer to our request to Norsk Tillitsmann ASA to summon a bondholders' meeting in the Bond Issue to consider our proposals for certain amendments to the Loan Agreement and the related security documentation.
The purpose of this letter is to describe the Borrower's current situation and the background to the proposal to be put before the bondholders' meeting.
Capitalised terms used in this letter used but not defined in this letter shall have the same meaning as assigned to them in the Loan Agreement or in the summons to the bondholders' meeting as the case may be.
BACKGROUND TO THE PROPOSAL
The Borrower is through its four wholly-owned subsidiaries Mosvold Supply I Ltd., Mosvold Supply II Ltd., Mosvold Supply III Ltd. and Mosvold Supply IV Ltd. respectively party to construction contracts with Otto Offshore Limited, Labuan, Malaysia (the "Yard") for the construction of four Anchor Handling and Tug Supply Vessels (AHTS) of VS 491 design with Hull No 7047, 7048, 7049 and 7050 respectively (the "Vessels").
The contractual delivery date for Hull 7047 is 31 October 2009. The Yard's current estimated delivery date is 15 April 2010. Mosvold has a right to cancel the Construction Contract for Hull 7047 if Hull 7047 has not been delivered by 30 April 2010 for reasons other than permissible delay.
It is Mosvold assessment that delivery of Hull No 7047 is likely to be delayed beyond the cancelling date.
Also for the other Vessels, the Yard has experienced delays in the range of three to four months.
In accordance with the Construction Contract, Mosvold has paid pre-delivery installments on Hull No 7047 in the amount of USD 23,200,500 which is equivalent to 30% of the contract price for Hull No 7047. The pre-delivery installments are secured by refund guarantees from Bangkok Bank Public Company Limited.

For the other Vessels, the financial position is as follows:

USD 77,335,000
USD 33,000,000 EUR 36,357,000 USD 33,800,000 EUR 37,239,000

All pre-delivery installments for all Vessels are secured by refund guarantees from Bangkok Bank Public Company Limited, Standard Chartered Bank Pic. and United Overseas Bank Ltd.
Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Loan Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) has security in the amount of NOK 185,000,000 plus expenses and accrued interest in the form of a second priority assignment in the construction contracts for Hull No 7047 and 7048 and a second priority pledge in the shares in the subsidiaries which are party to the construction contracts for Hull 7047 and 7048. According to the Loan Agreement, the security is intended to rank behind up to USD 112 million of first priority security. The Borrower has however so far not taken any debt which is ranking ahead of the Bonds.
No security has currently been granted in relation to Hull 7049 and 7050.
The Borrower is required to pay further pre-delivery installments, first of which is agreed with the Yard to be due 16 November 2009 and which is in the amount of approximately USD 8.7 million.
The Borrower currently has cash in the amount of approximately USD 2.1 million. The remaining pre-delivery installment on Hull No 7049 and Hull no 7050 are due for payment on 16 November 2009 and no earlier than February 2010 respectively. Assuming that Hull no 7047 is cancelled and the changes are made to the Loan Agreement as proposed, Mosvold will have about USD 7 mill in liquidity as per year-end 2009. It is currently expected that Mosvold needs to raise about USD 10-11 mill in new capital in Q1 or Q2 2010 in order to pay the said installment on Hull no 7050 and to be fully funded until delivery of the first vessel.
In view of the apparent delay in the construction of the Vessel and also taking into account the current difficult market conditions for AHTS vessels, the Borrower has negotiated an agreement with the Yard with the following main elements:
· Immediate cancellation of the construction contract for Hull no 7047.
· Immediate repayment of paid installments including interest on Hull no 7047.
· Move "contractual delivery dates" by 3, 2 and 1 month(s) respectively for remaining three vessels. This would imply a contractual delivery date for Hull 7048 on 30 September 2010, for Hull 7049 on 28 February 2011 and for Hull 7050 on 31 August 2011.

2

Increase contractual "grace period" from 30 days to 60 days on remaining three vessels. · Certain clarifications of the specifications on Hull No. 7048, 7049 and 7050 without additional time or cost for Mosvold. This agreement is subject to approval from the Mosvold board and Bondholder consent to the proposals described in the summons to the Bondholders' meeting. Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower shall redeem 50% of the Remaining Loan if one of Hull 7047 or 7048 is sold or the construction contract terminated. The redemption value shall be 106% of par value if such sale or termination takes place between the Interest Payment Date in June 2008 and the Interest Payment Date in June 2010. The Borrower proposes to amend this provision as further described in the summons to the bondholders' meeting. We otherwise refer to the information given in the summons to the bondholders' meeting.
