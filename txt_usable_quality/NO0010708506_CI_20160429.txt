Notes to the consolidated financial statements

1. Reporting entity
Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. (hereafter "the Company") is a private limited liability company domiciled in the Netherlands. The Company's registered office is at Zwolseweg 1, 2994 LB, Barendrecht and has its legal seat in Rotterdam. These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively the `Group' and individually `Group companies') together operating as Veritas Petroleum Service Group. The Group primarily provides testing and survey services to the Maritime industry.
Veritas Petroleum Services Holding B.V. is the head of the Veritas Petroleum Services group. The parents of the group are VPS International S.a.r.l. (50%), DET Norske Veritas Holding AS (47%) and VPS Management Holding B.V. (3%). The ultimate parent of VPS International S.a.r.l. is IK VII Limited.
The operations of Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its group companies are mainly comprised of participating in, financing and managing of other companies, as well as serving the Maritime industry since launching their commercial Fuel Quality Testing (FQT) services in 1981. The Group offers a wide range of fuel management services to assist ship operators, power plant operators and other industry operators with total fuel management solutions, delivering measurable improvements to risk management, cost and operational efficiency and compliance with regulatory requirements.

2. Basis of accounting and measurement
These consolidated statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU) and the statutory provisions of Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared at the historical cost convention, except for the net defined benefit (asset) liability, which has been accounted for at fair value or the plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
These consolidated financial statements reflect all of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Group (See note 27 for an overview of the Group legal entities) and disclose all matters relevant to Veritas Petroleum Services B.V.'s ability to continue as a going concern. Veritas Petroleum Services has the intent and ability to undertake necessary precautions to continue on a going concern basis.
These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Company's board of directors on 19 April 2016.
Details of the Group's accounting policies are included in Notes 5 and 6.
Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of United States Dollars (USD), which is the Company's functional currency.

3. Use of judgements and estimates
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Group's accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimated and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Critical estimates, judgements and errors The areas involving significant estimates or judgements are related to
Note 14 - impairment test: key assumptions underlying recoverable amount
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the entity and that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Measurement of fair values A number of the Group's disclosures require the measurement of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows.
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e derived from prices). Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entire in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.
Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in:
Note 14 impairment test: key assumptions underlying recoverable amount; and Note 20 - employee benefits: based on actuarial calculations.
4. Changes in accounting policies
Except for the changes below, the Group has consistently applied the accounting policies set out in Note 5 to all periods presented in this consolidated financial statements.
The Group has adopted the following new standards, amendments to a standard including any consequential amendments to other standards, and new interpretations with an effective date for annual periods beginning after or on 1 January 2015.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments - Disclosures (2005)
The nature and effects of the changes are explained below.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments - Disclosures (2005)
IFRS 7 (2005) requires disclosure of information about the significance of financial instruments to an entity, and the nature and extent of risks arising from those financial instruments, both in qualitative and quantitative terms. Where relevant, the Group has applied the amendments to IFRS 7 that became effective in 2015. The adoption of these amendments and interpretations did not have a material impact on the Company's financial performance or disclosures.

5. Significant accounting policies
The Group has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. Certain comparative amounts in these consolidated financial statements have been reclassified and/ or more in detail presented in line with the guidelines of IAS 1.
Basis of consolidation
Business combinations The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity instruments.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to influence those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
Transaction eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra group transactions, are eliminated.
Foreign currency
Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (`the functional currency'). The financial statements are presented in United States dollars which is the group's presentation currency and equals the functional currency.
Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement within finance income or cost.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Group companies The results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(b) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
(c) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Revenue
Rendering of services Main activity of the Group is performing services to the Maritime industry. The Group entered different type of billing arrangement with its customers. Revenue from rendering services as far these are completed at the reporting date are recognised in profit or loss. Received amounts from service arrangements wherefore services are not completed at reporting date are recognised as deferred income.
Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured based on net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates.
Expenses Expenses arising from the company's business operations are accounted for as operating expenses in the year incurred. Losses are recognised as soon as they are foreseen.
Employee benefits The group operates various post-employment schemes, including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
Pension obligations A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan.
Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

Veritas Petroleum Services B.V., Rotterdam

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.
For defined contribution plans, the group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
The Company's branch office in United Arab Emirates provides end of service benefits to its employees. The entitlement of these benefits is based upon the employees' final salary and length of service, subject to the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accounted for based on the Project Unit Credit Method (PUCM) over the period of employment.
Finance income and finance costs The group's finance income and finance costs include:
Interest income; Interest expenses; Dividend income; The net gain or loss on financial assets and financial liabilities; Foreign currency translation.
Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss and the date on which the Group's right to receive payment is established.
Income tax Income tax expenses comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss for except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in Other Comprehensive Income.
Current tax Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustments to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.
Current tax assets and liabilities are only offset if certain criteria are met.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for:
Temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and the affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; Temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and Taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the group expects, at reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. For this purpose, the carrying amount of investment property measured at fair value is presumed to be recovered through sale, and the Group has not rebutted this resumption.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.
Property, plant and equipment
Recognition and measurement Property, plant and equipment are non-current assets used in the operating activities of the Group with a useful life of over one year. An item of property, plant and equipment is initially recognised at its acquisition cost which consists of the purchase price and other expenditures directly related to the acquisition that are necessary for bringing the asset to its operating condition and location.
An item of property, plant and equipment is subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure incurred for an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as a non-current asset when it is probable that the Group wilt derive future economic benefits from it and its cost can be measured reliably.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within `Other Income & Expense' in the income statement.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

Depreciation Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally recognised in profit or loss. Land is not depreciated.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years of significant items of Property, Plant and Equipment are as follows:

Buildings Equipment, fixtures and fittings

20 - 35 years 3 - 1 0 years

Intangible assets and goodwill

Intangibles - Customer relationships Separately acquired customer relationships are shown at historical cost. Customer relationships in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Customer relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful lives with a maximum of 17 years.

Intangibles - software Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:

it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use; management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it; there is an ability to use or sell the software product; it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits; adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured

Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, which does not exceed five years.

Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

Financial Instruments The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity financial assets, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.

The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category.

Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities - Recognition and de-recognition The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and debt securities issued on the date when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date.

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual right to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are transferred, or it neither transfers nor retains substantially all or the risk and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset. Any interest in such derecognised financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Non-derivative financial assets - Measurement

Financial asset at fair value through profit or loss
Held-to-maturity financial assets
Loans and receivables
Financial asset available for sale

A financial asset is classified at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held-for-trading or designated as such on initial recognition. Directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Financial assets at fair value profit or loss are measured at fair value and changed therein, including any interest and dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss. These assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised costs using the effective interest method. These assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised costs using the effective interest method. These assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised through other comprehensive income.

Non-derivative financial liabilities - Measurement Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised costs using the effective interest method.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as share capital. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Impairment of financial assets A financial asset is impaired if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. An assessment is made at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is objective evidence that a specified asset, or a group of similar assets, may be impaired. If such evidence exists any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount of an interestbearing instrument is determined based on the net present value of future cash flows discounted at original effective interest rates. Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on assets carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired debtors are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
Impairment of non-financial assets Non-financial assets, like property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The fair value less costs to sell is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm's length transaction, whilst value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. The discount rate used for value-in-use calculations is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to that asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement. Reversal of impairment losses recognised in prior years (other than goodwill) is recorded as income when there is an indication that the impairment losses recognised for the asset no longer exist or have decreased.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are amounts due from customers for products provided and services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets. Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents In the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the qualifying borrowing are added to the cost of the borrowing and amortised over the same period of the borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost, which is the amount received plus or minus any premium or discount, less transaction costs. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised as interest in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are obligations to pay for products and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Leases At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether the arrangements is or contains a lease.
At interception or on reassessment of an arrangement that contains a lease, the Group separates payments and other consideration required by the arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values. If the Group concludes for a finance lease that is impracticable to separate the payments reliably, then an asset and liability are recognised at an amount equal to the fair value of underlying assets; subsequently, the liability is reduced as payments are made and an imputed finance cost on the liability is recognised using the group's incremental borrowing rate.
Lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of lease.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Cash flow statement The cash flow statement has been prepared using the indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. Corporate income taxes, issuance of share capital, interest received and dividends received are presented under the cash flow from operating activities. The bond loan, buy backs of the loan, interest paid and dividends paid are presented under the cash flow from financing activities. Acquisition of assets and the cost of group companies acquired is presented under the cash flow from investment activities, as far as payment has been made with cash and cash equivalents. The cash and cash equivalents of the group companies acquired are deducted from the purchase cost.

6. Standards issued but not yet adopted

A number of new standards and amendments to standards are issued but not yet mandatorily effective (but early adoption is allowed) for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2015; however, the Group has not applied the following new or amended standards in preparing these financial statements.

New or amended standards IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Summary of the requirements
IFRS 9, published in July 2014, replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financials instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and the new general hedge accounting requirements. It also carries forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from IAS 39. IFRS 9 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 2018, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. IFRS 15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted.

Possible impact on consolidated financial statements The Group is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from application of IFRS 9.

IFRS 16 Leases

IFRS 16 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases, with the objective of ensuring that lessees and lessors provide relevant information that faithfully represents those transactions. IFRS 16 will supersede IAS 17 and require almost all leases to be on the balance sheet of lessees and introduces a single income statement model which basically treats all leases as finance leases. IFRS 16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted if IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has also been applied.

The Group is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from application of IFRS 16.

The following new or amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact of the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture (Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28) Accounting for acquisitions of an interest in a joint operation (Amendments to IFRS 11) Application of the consolidation exception (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12, IAS 28) IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts Disclosure initiative ((Amendments to IAS 1) Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses (Amendments to IAS 12) Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation (Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38) Reinstating the equity method as an accounting option for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in an entity's separate financial statements (Amendments to IAS 27) IAS 41 Agriculture: Bearer Plants (Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41) Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 cycle

B. Impairment of goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, the total amount of goodwill is allocated to its cash generating unit Veritas Petroleum Services Group. The recoverable amount of this CGU was based on fair value less costs of disposal, estimated using discounted cash flows. The fair value measurement was categorised as a Level 3 value based on the inputs in the valuation technique used.
The key assumptions used in the estimation of the recoverable amount are set out below. The values assigned to the key assumptions represents management's assessment of future trends in the marine fuel market and have been based on historical data from both and internal resources.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

The discount rate was a post-tax measure estimated based on the observable Maritime industry weighted-average cost of capital

The cash flow projections included specific estimated for four years and a terminal value growth rate thereafter. The terminal growth rate was determined based on management's estimate of the long-term compound annual EBITDA growth rate, consistent with the assumption that a market participant would make.

Budgeted EBITDA was estimated taking into account past experience, adjusted as follows.

Revenue growth was projected taking into account the average growth levels experienced since the Company acquired the Petroleum Service business. Significant one-off (post) acquisition, refinance and organisational restructuring costs are excluded from budgeted EBITDA. Estimated cash flows related to remaining post-acquisition optimisation projects that is expected to be carried out in 2016 ware reflected in the budgeted EBITDA.

The recoverable amount of CGU being USD 155 million exceeded its carrying amount of USD 118 million by USD 37 million (headroom). Management has identified that a reasonably possible change in three key assumptions could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount. The following table shows the impact on the headroom based on the movements of these assumptions.

Unsecured bond loan The Group issued on 1 April 2014 an unsecured bond loan for in total USD 70 million of which the proceeds have been used for a repayment on the shareholders loan of USD 75 million. The total unsecured bond loan amount is divided in 350 coupons with a face value of USD 200,000 each, which ranks pari passu between themselves. By issuing the bond loan, the Group entered into a bond agreement with its bond holders which stipulates certain (financial) requirements to be met (See also Note 24). The issued unsecured bond loan on the Oslo Stock Exchange has been listed per 4 February 2015. A compliance certificate is submitted on a quarterly basis starting per 31 March 2015.

In 2015 the Group bought back bonds for the amount of USD 3.8 million (nominal value) as part of ordinary liquidity management. The difference between the settlement price and the amortised cost using the effective interest method is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Unsecured Shareholders loan The Group borrowed an initial loan of USD 75 million of its shareholder which has been partly repaid in 2014. The loan bears an annual interest of 10% which are capitalized to the outstanding amount on an annual basis. The remainder of the loan will be repaid in financial year 2023 or earlier upon a partly disposal of the shareholders interest.
Information about the Group's exposure to fair values, interest rate, foreign currency and liquidity risk is included in Note 24.

The Group contributes to the following post-employment defined benefit plans.
Plan A is a defined benefit plan which entitles a retired employee to receive an annual pension payment. The plan is beneficiary for in total 13 employees (2014: 13) in The Netherlands which are still in active duty. Plan has been closed for new participants. As of 31 December 2015 the contract for the post-employment defined benefit plan has been terminated and the post employment defined benefit rights have been transferred to the participants. All participants have been moved from the post-employment defined benefit plan to the post-employment defined contribution plan. Any risk associated to the post-employment defined benefit plans is limited. Plan B is a defined benefit plan which entitles a retired employee to receive an annual pension payment based on the employee's salary level at the time of retirement and on the number of years of provided service. The retirement age is 67 years. In total, the plan is beneficiary for 2 people (2014: 2) in Norway. The plan has been closed for new participants. Plan C is a defined benefit plan which entitles an employee an end of service benefit. The plan is beneficiary for in total 35 employees (2014: 34) in United Arab Emirates which are still in active duty. The benefit is settled when the employee is not employed at the Company.
The defined benefits plans are administered by a single pension fund that is legally separated from the Group except for plan C.

Since the post-employment defined benefit contract is terminated in Netherlands and the number of participants in Norway is limited, any risk associated with the post-employment defined benefit plans is considered limited. The Group has no further obligation other than the annual contribution to the Norwegian pension provider.
Employees' end-of-service benefits (Plan C) The Company provides its employees an end-of service benefit (Plan C) for which a provision is provided. Any movement in the provision is recognised in statement of profit or loss. The following were the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date used for employees' end-of-service benefit calculation based on the Project Unit Credit Method:

Discount rate Future salary growth Change of turnover within 5 years

Ptan C 2.55» 3.50% 30.00%

Sensitivity analysis (plan C) The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on reasonable possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.

23. Capital management
The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders over the longer term and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. Reference is made to note 24 regarding management the Company's capital on basis of the gearing ratio covenant.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group does currently not pay dividends under its financing agreements and the Group strives to retain sound solvency and liquidity levels.
24. Financial instruments
Risk management framework The Company's board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. In 2015 a risk control framework is developed and a risk assessment has been performed. Based on the identified business and financial risks, internal controls are being identified and documented and will subsequently be tested to evaluate the design and implementation of such internal control. In addition, group's risk management policies will be documented and monitored. The Compliance manager will report regularly to the board of directors on his activities.
The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse risk faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risk adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of risk control framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
Fair value
Non-current financial instruments As per 31 December the fair values of non-current financial instruments differs not material from its carrying amount.
Current financial instruments As per 31 December the carrying amounts of the current financial instruments represents its fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to a large number of customer contracts which are unrelated. Therefore the Group believes that no additional credit risk provision is required besides the normal provision for bad debt.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

Trade and other receivables The Group established an allowance for impairment that reflects its estimate of incurred losses in respect of the indicated credit risks regarding trade receivables. For the sales occurred during 2015, the credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate. Further details of concentration of revenue are included in Note 7.

A credit policy has been established where each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group's standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group reviews external ratings, if they are available, and in some cases bank references. For all new customers a creditworthiness check is performed and for existing customers the creditworthiness is reviewed on a yearly basis.
The Group is closely monitoring the world economy as the Group's sales is depending on the developments in marine fuel market.

The Group uses for its analysis a monitoring portfolio management tool of credit agency Dun and Bradstreet. Credit ratings of the Group's trade receivables are determined on available information in Dun and Bradstreet's databases. Trade receivables classified at highest risk includes observed highest risk counter parts as well as unclassified counterparties.

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade and other receivables during the year was as follows.

In 2015 management focussed on collecting the outstanding balances, especially the overdue balances. As a result the Group managed to reduce the overdue balances outstanding. Consequently the impairment loss for overdue balances is reduced significantly in comparison to prior year. As a result a reversal of the collective impairment amount is recognised of USD 566 thousand (2014: USD 742 thousand impairment loss recognised). The Group believes that its allowance for impairment as per 31 December 2015 is sufficient to absorb expected future write offs on trade and other receivable.

Cash and Cash equivalents The Group held cash and cash equivalents of USD 12,614 thousand at 31 December 2015 (2014: USD 11,548 thousand). The cash and cash equivalents are held by bank counter parties, which are rated AA-, based on Standard & Poor's ratings.

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation.

The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a cash flow forecast model. This model considers the maturity of both its non-current and current assets and liabilities (trade receivables and other financial assets or liabilities) and projected cash flows from operations.

The Group aims to maintain the level of its cash and cash equivalents at an amount in excess of expected cash outflows on financial liabilities (other than trade payables over the next 60 days). The Group also monitors the level of expected cash inflows on trade and other receivables together with expected cash outflows on trade and other payables.

At 31 December 2015, the expected cash flows from trade and other receivables maturing within two months were USD 4,600 thousand (2014: USD 9,000 thousand).

This excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.

Exposure to liquidity risk The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are gross and undiscounted, and include estimated interest payments and exclude the impact of netting agreements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

The Group has an unsecured bond loan that contains loan covenants. A future breach of covenants may require the Group to repay the loan earlier than indicated in the above table. Under the agreement, the covenants are monitored on a regular basis by the Group finance team and regularly reported to the management to ensure compliance with the agreement.

As a result the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio covenant as part of the bond agreement. This ratio is calculated as net interest bearing debt divided by EBITDA. Net interest bearing debt is calculated as total aggregated loans and borrowings less shareholder loans and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. The EBITDA is calculated as `earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and before exceptional items'. The covenant includes a maximum gearing ratio of 5.5% per end of 2015. Per 31 December 2015, the Group complied with all quarterly and annual covenant requirements.

The interest payments on the shareholders loan and bond issues in the table above are based on fixed interest rates as disclosed in note 19. In addition, the interest rate of the shareholders loan will be accrued for and for that reason a cash outflow at repayment date. It is not expected that cash flows included in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier or at significant different amounts.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.

Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales, purchases and borrowings are denominated and the respective functional currencies of Group companies. The functional currencies of the Group is US dollar. The currencies in which these transactions are primarily denominated are US dollar, Euro, Singapore Dollar and Norwegian Krone.

The group's borrowings are denominated in US dollar that match the cash flow generated by the underlying operations of the Group - primarily in US dollar. In addition, interest on borrowings is denominated in the currency of the borrowing. This provides an economic hedge without derivate being entered into and therefore hedge accounting is not applied in these circumstances.

Exposure to currency risk The summary quantitative data about the Group's exposure to currency risk as reported to the management of the Group is as follows per 31 December 2015.

Interest rate risk The Group's interest exposure is nil as all its borrowings are at a fixed rate. In addition, the Group's policy is not to enter borrowing agreements with a floating rate.

25. Operating leases
Leases as lessee The Group leases a number of offices and laboratories facilities under operating leases. The leases typically run for a period of 5 years, with an option to renew these leases after that date. Lease payments are renegotiated every 5 years to reflect the market rentals. Some leases provide additional rent payments that are based on changes in local price indices. For certain operating leases, the Group is restricted from entering into any sub lease arrangements. The offices and laboratories lease were entered into pre-acquisition which is many years ago as combined lease of land and buildings. The Group determined that the land and building elements of the offices and laboratories leases are operating leases.
The rent paid to the landlord is adjusted to market rentals at regular intervals, and the Group does not have an interest in the residual value of the land and building elements of the offices and laboratories. As a result, it was determined that substantially all the risks and rewards of the land and building elements of the offices and laboratories are with the landlord.
Furthermore, the Group has liabilities relating to operating leases for cars provided to employees, each lease having a term of up to four years.

Notes to the Company financial statements

29. General
The Company financial statements are part of the 2015 financial statements of Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. For the company statement of Income of Veritas Petroleum Services B.V., use is made of the exemption to present the company statement of Income in a condensed form pursuant to Section 2:402 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code. For setting the principles for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and determination of the result for its company financial statements, Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. makes use of the option in Section 2:362 (8) of Part 9 of The Netherlands Civil Code. This means that the principles for recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities and determination of the result for the Company financial statements of Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. are the same as those for the consolidated financial statements. In this context, investments in companies in which significant control is exercised are measured according to the net asset value method.
30. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the International Accounting Standards Boards (IASB) and endorsed by the European Union and with Part 9, Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code. For a description of these accounting principles, reference is made to the accounting principles within the consolidated financial statements (see Note 5). The share in the result of subsidiaries in which the company has holdings comprises the share of Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. in the result of the subsidiaries. Results on transactions in which transfer of assets and liabilities has occurred between Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its subsidiaries, and mutually between subsidiaries which each other, are not recognised insofar as these can be considered as not realised.
31. Significant accounting policies
These are the same as for the consolidated financial statements. In addition, the net equity method is applied for the investments in consolidated subsidiaries based on the parent company's accounting policies.

Share premium The issued shares, in total 63,000,000 shares were priced against USD 1.00 per share. Additional paid-in capital of USD 56,700,000 has been recognised as share premium which is free distributable.
Retained earnings The amount in retained earnings is in principle available for profit sharing among the shareholders as far as its balance is positive per end of reporting date. In respect to this, following the bond agreement the Company could restrict the availability of retained earnings for profit sharing as financial covenant stipulations are not met.

Legal reserve The legal reserve represents a foreign currency translation reserve in a foreign Group's subsidiary which is legally attached to this subsidiary. As the Group accounting policy regarding foreign currency is to recognise foreign currency translation differences in profit or loss, this amount is not accounted for in the foreign currency translation reserve.

Our audit approach Overview and context
W e designed our aud it b y d eterm inin g m ateriality and assessin g th e risks o f m aterial m isstatem en t in the financial statem ents. In particular, w e looked at w here m anagem ent m ade subjective judgem ents, for exam ple in respect o f significant accounting estim ates that involved m aking assum ption s and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. M oreover and apart from the key audit m atter in clu ded in this report, o th er areas o f fo cu s d riven b y th e o p eration s o f V eritas P etro leu m S ervices B.V. as provider o f fuel quality testing services and bunker quantity surveys were accounts receivable, accrued revenue, deferred revenue and revenue recognition. A s in all o f our audits, w e also addressed the risk of m anagem ent override o f internal controls, including evaluating w hether there w as evidence o f bias by m anagem ent that m ay represent a risk o f m aterial m isstatem ent due to fraud. W e ensured that th e audit team s both at group and at com pon en t levels included the ap propriate skills and com petences w hich are needed for the audit o f a provider o f fuel quality testing sendees and bunker quantity surveys. W e therefore included specialist in the areas o f IT, valuation and em ployee benefits in our team .

Materiality
The scope o f our audit is in flu en ced b y the application o f m ateriality w hich is fu rth er explain ed in the section `O ur responsibilities for the audit o f the financial statem ents'.
W e set certain quantitative thresholds for m ateriality. These, together w ith qualitative considerations, helped us to determ ine the nature, tim ing and extent o f our audit procedures on the individual financial statem ent line item s and disclosures and to evaluate the effect o f identified m isstatem ents on our opinion.
Based on our professional judgem ent, w e determ ined m ateriality for the financial statem ents as a w hole as follows:

Overall group materiality How we determined it

US$ 521,000 (2014: US$ 520,000)
The company has a relatively fixed cost base up to a certain level of activities given the nature of those activities. The financial performance is therefore mainly reflected through the company's revenue developments. This results in the company's revenue being a significant determining factor for the EBTIDA. Based on the aforementioned and our understanding of the key stakeholders we determined revenue to be the appropriate benchmark. Due to this, materiality is determined as

Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. - Ref.: 00377938 Page 3 of g

Rationalefor benchmark applied
Component materiality

1% of total revenue. We have applied this benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, based on our analysis of the value creation drivers of the business and its key performance indicators as defined by management and stakeholders of the company. On this basis, we believe that total revenue is an appropriate benchmark.
To each component in our audit scope, we, based on our judgement, allocate materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between US$ 328,000 and US$ 483,000.

W e also take m isstatem ents and/or possible m isstatem ents into account that, in our jud gem ent, are m aterial for qualitative reasons.
W e agreed w ith m anagem ent that w e w ould report to them m isstatem ents identified during our audit above US$ 26,000 (2014: US$ 26,000) as w ell as m isstatem ents below that am ount that, in our view , w arranted reporting for qualitative reasons'.
The scope o f our group audit
V eritas Petroleum Services B.V. is the paren t com pan y o f a group o f entities. The fin an cial inform ation o f this group is included in the consolidated financial statem ents o f V eritas P etroleum Services B.V.
The group's accounting process is stru ctu red around a local fin an ce fu n ction in each o f the three re g io n s ("E u ro p e ", "A m e r ic a s " a n d "A fr ic a , M id d le E a st & A s ia ") in w h ic h th e g ro u p o p e ra te s th ro u g h four com ponents besides the parent entity. These functions m aintain their own accounting records and controls and report to the head office finance team in the N etherlands through an integrated consolidation system .
W e tailored the scope o f our audit to ensure that w e perform ed enough w ork to be able to give an opinion on the financial statem ents as a w hole, taking into account: the geographic and m anagem ent structure o f the group, including the nature o f operations; the accounting processes and controls; and the m arkets in w hich the group operates.
A full scope audit was perform ed for four com ponents, w hich includes the parent com pany, as these are individually significant to the group. The three other com ponents are: V eritas Petroleum Services A sia Pte. Ltd, V eritas Petroleum Services E u rope B.V. and V P S T estin g & Inspection Inc. W e further perform ed audit procedures o f specific account balances and analytical procedures at Veritas Petroleum Services A S in order to obtain sufficient coverage o f specific financial statem ent lin e item s in the consolidated financial statem ents.
In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, w e determ ined the type o f w ork that needed to be perform ed at the com ponents b y the group engagem ent team and b y com ponent auditors. W here the w ork was perform ed b y com ponent auditors, w e determ ined the level o f involvem ent w e needed to have in the audit w o rk at those com ponents to be able to conclude w hether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statem ents as a whole. The group engagem ent team directed the planning, review ed the results o f the w ork undertaken b y com ponent auditors and assessed and discussed the findings w ith the com ponent auditors during conference calls.

The group consolidation, financial statem ent disclosures and a num ber o f com plex item s are audited by the group engagem ent team at the head office. These include goodw ill im pairm ent testing, transfer pricing and the bond loan.

Taken together, and excluding our group analytical procedures, our audit coverage as defined in p ercen tages in the table b elo w is based on th e full scope audits perform ed as w ell as the audit procedures o f specific account balances as described above.

Revenue Total assets PTofit before tax

100% 99% 94%

N one o f the rem aining com ponents represented m ore than 1% o f total group revenue or total group assets. For those rem aining com ponents w e perform ed, am ongst others, analytical procedures to corroborate our assessm ent that there w ere no significant risks o f m aterial m isstatem ents w ithin those com ponents.

By perform ing the procedures above at com ponents, com bined with additional procedures at group level, w e have obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial inform ation o f the group to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statem ents.

Key audit matters
K ey audit m atters are those m atters that, in our p rofession al jud gem en t, w ere o f m ost significance in the audit o f the financial statem ents. W e have com m unicated the key audit m atter to the board of directors, but it is not a com prehensive reflection o f all m atters that w ere identified b y our audit and that w e discussed. W e described the key audit m atter and included a sum m ary o f the audit procedures we perform ed on that m atter.

The key audit m atter was addressed in the context o f our audit o f the fin an cial statem ents as a whole, and in form ing our opinion thereon. W e do not provide a separate opinion on this m atter or on specific elem ents o f the financial statem ents. A n y com m ents w e m ake on the results o f our procedures should be read in this context.

Key audit matter________________________ How our audit addressed the matter________

Valuation o f goodwill Note 14 b
In 2013 the Company acquired DNV Petroleum Sendees AS and its subsidiaries. At the acquisition date goodwill was recognized of US$ 64 million (refer to note 14b), which is grouped together with other assets of the group under one cash generating unit. Management performed the required annual goodwill impairment test in accordance with IAS 36, `Impairment of Assets' and concluded that a headroom of US$ 37 million exists over the carrying amount of the

We reviewed the analysis for the determination of the cash generating unit for the purposes of the impairment test.
Further audit procedures included detailed assessment and challenging of the underlying assumptions used in the model. In addition we performed testing procedures over the mathematical accuracy of the calculations performed by management.
Our valuation specialists assisted us in evaluating and challenging the assumptions and methodologies

the cash generating unit.
The assumptions in the impairment test include the budgeted EBITDA growth rate based on expected developments of prices and quantity of services to be provided, terminal value growth rate as well as the discount rate. The assumptions are further disclosed in note 14b to the financial statements.
The impairment test is significant to our audit as it requires significant management judgement, and it is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market conditions. Furthermore, the outcome of the test is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions.

applied by management in its impairment test, in particular those relating to the budgeted EBITDA growth rate, terminal value growth rate and the discount rate. We assessed these assumptions through gaining a detailed understanding from management of the underlying EBITDA forecast including expected development of prices and quantity of services to be provided and comparing this forecast with historical performance of the Group. In addition, we have performed a peer group analysis to assess the discount rate and verified the terminal value growth rate by using market data obtained from external parties. Moreover, we have challenged the recoverable amount by using a peer group multiple EBITDA analysis. We also focused on the adequacy of the Company's disclosures regarding those assumptions including the sensitivity analyses (as included in note 14b). We found the underlying assumptions to be reasonable.

Responsibilities o f the board o f directors
The board o f directors is responsible for:

·

the preparation and fair presentation o f the financial statem ents in accordance w ith EU-IFRS

The auditor's responsibilitiesfor the audit o f thefinancial statements
W e have exercised professional judgem ent and have m aintained professional scepticism throughout the audit in accordance w ith D utch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirem ents and independence requirem ents. O ur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about w hether the financial statem ents as a w hole are free from m aterial m isstatem ent, w hether due to fraud or error. O ur audit consisted, am ong others o f the following:

·

Identifying and assessing the risks o f m aterial m isstatem ent o f the financial statem ents, whether

due to fraud or error, designing and perform ing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and

obtaining audit eviden ce that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

The risk o f not detecting a m aterial m isstatem ent resulting from fraud is higher than for one

resulting from error, as fraud m ay involve collusion, forgery, intentional om issions,

m isrepresentations, or the intentional override o f internal control.

·

Obtaining an understanding o f internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit

procedures that are appropriate in the circum stances, but not for the purpose o f expressing an

opinion on th e effectiveness o f the com pany's internal control.

·

Evaluating the appropriateness o f accounting policies used and the reasonableness of

accounting estim ates and related disclosures m ade b y the board o f directors.

·

Concluding on the appropriateness o f the board o f directors' use o f the going-concern basis of

accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding w hether a m aterial

uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that m ay cast significant doubt on the

com pany's ability to continue as a going-concern. If w e conclu d e th at a m aterial u n certain ty

exists, w e are requ ired to draw attention in our aud itor's rep o rt to the related disclosu res in the

financial statem ents or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to m odify our opinion. O ur

conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to th e date o f our aud itor's report and

are m ade in the context o f our opinion on the financial statem ents as a whole. H ow ever, future

events or conditions m ay cause the com pany to cease to continue as a going-concern.

·

Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content o f the financial statem ents, including

the disclosures, and evaluating w hether the financial statem ents represent the underlying

transactions and events in a m anner that achieves fair presentation.

Considering our ultim ate responsibility fo r the opinion on the com p an y's consolidated fin an cial statem ents w e are responsible for the direction, supervision and perform ance o f the group audit. In this context, we have determ ined the nature and extent o f the audit procedures for com ponents o f the group to ensure that w e perform ed enough w ork to be able to give an opinion on the financial statem ents as a whole. D eterm ining factors are the geographic structure o f the group, the significance and/or risk profile o f group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in w hich the group operates. On this basis, w e selected group entities for w hich an audit or review of financial inform ation or specific balances was considered necessary.
