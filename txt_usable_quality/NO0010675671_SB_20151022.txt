Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - proposal to certain amendments of the Bond Agreement
1. INTRODUCTION
Nordic Trustee ASA, formerly known as Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") of USD 225 million issued by Sterling Resources (UK) pic (previously Sterling Resources (UK) Ltd) ("Sterling" or the "Issuer"), and guaranteed by Sterling Resources Ltd. (the "Parent" and together with its subsidiaries the "Group").
Capitalised terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement originally entered into on 2 May 2013, as amended and restated on 12 December 2014 and as further amended and restated on 22 May 2015 (the "Bond Agreement").
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and the described transactions and the proposal set out in Section 3 (Proposed Amendments to the Bond Agreement) below is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
Bondholders are encouraged to read this summons letter in its entirety.
2. BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Bond Agreement, the Issuer shall on 30 October 2015 pay to the Bondholders an Instalment in accordance with Clause 10.1 of the Bond Agreement and an interest payment in accordance with Clause 9 of the Bond Agreement.
At the end of October 2015, the Group is expected to have a cash deficit of approximately USD 20 million, after (i) completion of the Romanian Assets Disposal during August 2015, (ii) paying the Postponed Instalment from 30 April 2015 at 107.50% of par value (and accumulated interest) of USD 24.8 million upon closing of the Romanian Asset Disposal, (iii) paying the Instalment at 107.50% of par value and interest payment on 30 October 2015 o f USD 32.3 million, and (iv) providing for USD 10 million of minimum Liquidity from 31 October 2015.
Sterling has retained MHW Associates Limited and Jefferies international as financial advisers to assist in identifying, evaluating and negotiating certain alternatives for a transaction (the "Transaction") that would result in the repayment in cash in full of all of the obligations and liabilities owed to the Bond Trustee and/or the Bondholders under or pursuant to the Finance Documents.

Sterling has progressed several potential Transactions, however, it has become clear that further time is required to reach agreement with all relevant parties. Accordingly, to facilitate completion of the Transaction, and avoid a breach of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer is approaching the Bondholders to ask for their consent to make certain amendments to and grant certain waivers in respect o f the Bond Agreement as described herein.
For further information on Sterling, an updated company presentation will be sent to Bondholders and posted on the website http://www.sterling-resources.com/in the next few days.

(ii) to the best of the Issuer's board of directors' knowledge and belief after due and careful enquiry, there is no event or circumstance which is reasonably likely to cause the Targeted Bond Redemption based on the Transaction Proposal (or, in the event that there are more than one Transaction Proposals, all of them) not to be achieved.
If the Independent Director had not supported the resolution of the Issuer's board of directors and is unwilling to sign an Issuer's Certificate on a given Issuer's Certificate Date (a "Relevant ICD"), the Issuer may provide the relevant Issuer's Certificate to the Bond Trustee during an extended period ending on the day falling ten Business Days after that Relevant ICD, provided that the Bond Trustee has received written notice to this effect no later than the date falling two Business Days before that Relevant ICD.

If:
(a) the Issuer fails to deliver within five Business Days of receipt of a Bond Trustee Progress Notice a written response providing details with supporting documentation to demonstrate (to the satisfaction of the Bond Trustee acting reasonably) that the Targeted Bond Redemption has a reasonable prospect of being achieved; or
(b) such information as is provided by the Issuer in response to a Bond Trustee Progress Notice is deemed by the Bond Trustee, acting reasonably, to be insufficient to support a conclusion that the Transaction Proposal has a reasonable prospect of being achieved,

that to the extent that there is any restriction imposed on the Parent by the TSXV or any other competent authority or pursuant to applicable law or regulation which would restrict the number or amount of Common Shares that could be issued by the Parent in non-cash payment of the Exit Fee (excluding the circumstances contemplated in the proviso to paragraph (d)), then the Non Cash Exit Fee may only apply to that amount of Common Shares which is capable of being issued by the Parent without any such restriction and the remainder of the Exit Fee shall be paid in cash in accordance with sub-paragraph (b)(ii)(l) above.
(d) The Parent shall procure that the Non Cash Exit Fee which the Issuer has elected to be paid in accordance with paragraph (c) above is paid by issuing, on or prior to the relevant Exit Fee Payment Date, a number of Common Shares equal to the result o f the amount o f the Non Cash Exit Fee divided by the Final VWAP and further provided that no Common Shares will be issued or transferred to any Bondholder if such Bondholder would, following receipt of such Common Shares, own (beneficially or legally) or exercise control or direction over 20% or more of all of the Common Shares then issued and outstanding unless such Bondholder has agreed in writing with the Parent that all such Common Shares that would cause it to own (beneficially or legally) or exercise control or direction over 20% of all of the Common Shares then issued and outstanding shall be deposited in trust with a trustee and only released on the earlier of: (i) such Common Shares no longer, when taken together with other Common Shares owned or controlled by such Bondholder, exceeding 20% of all of the Common Shares then issued and outstanding; or (ii) the approval of disinterested shareholders in the Parent to such holdings in excess of 20% has been obtained.

6.3 Adjustments

(a) The Exit Fee shall be documented in a fee letter (the "Exit Fee Letter") between the Parent, Issuer and the Bond Trustee which shall reflect the terms set out in Section 6.1 (Exit Fee Calculation) and include customary anti-dilution protections in respect of the rights to the Exit Fee (as would (subject to appropriate amendments to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Section 6) apply to convertible notes or warrants issued by publicly listed companies in Toronto) including (without limitation) adjustments for any reclassification, subdivision, re-division, issue, reduction, combination or consolidation of, or any like or similar event in respect of the Common Shares during the period between October 19, 2015 and the Final Equity Value Date.

(b) The Adjusted Price and the Final VWAP shall be adjusted as reasonably agreed between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee and the Bondholder Advisers for any theoretical increase or decrease in the trading price of Common Shares arising directly as a result of the issuance by the Parent of shares for cash below or above the then prevailing market price and in respect of In-the-Money Options.

(c) Prior to the Exit Fee Payment Date, without the prior written consent of the Bond Trustee,

unless in conjunction with a Transaction:

(i)

the Parent shall not:

(A) declare, make or pay any dividend, charge, fee or other distribution (or

interest on any unpaid dividend, charge, fee or other distribution)

(whether in cash or in kind) on or in respect of its share capital (or any

class of its share capital);

(B) repay or distribute any dividend or share premium reserve; or

(C) redeem, repurchase, defease, retire or repay any of its share capital or

resolve to do so; and

(ii) neither the Issuer nor the Parent shall:

(A) pay any management, advisory or other fee to or to the order of any of

the shareholders of the Parent (other than fees to shareholders of the

13

Parent in their capacity as commercial counterparties of the Group in the ordinary course of business); or (B) repay any loans from or extend any loans to the shareholders of the Parent.

7. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL
In the Issuer's opinion, the Proposal represents a fair proposal to the Bondholders. The Issuer believes that if approved the Proposal should ensure that the Issuer retains sufficient liquidity to continue operations, avoid a payment default and facilitate a full refinancing of the Bond by 29 February 2016 (at the latest).

8. BONDHOLDER SUPPORT
The Issuer has informed the Bond Trustee that Bondholders representing a majority of the Voting Bonds have given their support to the Proposal and Waiver.

9. NON-RELIANCE
The Proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. Nothing herein shall be construed as or constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the Proposal is acceptable and vote accordingly.

Bondholders are hereby summoned to a Bondholders' Meeting:

Time:

6 November 2015 at 13:00 hours (Oslo time)

Place:

The premises of Nordic Trustee ASA, Haakon VHs gt 1, 0161 Oslo - 6thfloor

Agenda: 1. Approval of the summons. 2. Approval o f the agenda. 3. Election of two persons to co-sign the minutes together with the chairman. 4. Request for adoption o f the Proposal:

It is proposed that the Bondholders' Meeting resolves the following:
"The Bondholder's Meeting approves the Proposal as described in Section 3 (Proposed Amendments to Bond Agreement) and Waiver as described in Section 4 (Request fo r Waiver) o f the summons fo r the Bondholders 'Meeting.
The Bond Trustee is hereby authorised to complete the negotiation o fform, terms, conditions and timing in relation to the Proposal, without any obligation to notify the Bondholders as provided fo r in Clause 16.2 o f the Bond Agreement. Further, the Bond Trustee is given power o f attorney to prepare, finalise and enter into the necessary agreements in connection with documenting the decisions made by the Bondholders ' Meetings as well as to carry out the necessary completion work, including but not limited to making appropriate amendments to the Bond Agreement and

14

enter into the Amendment and Restatement Agreement No. 3, including the Amended and Restated Bond Agreement No. 3, Assignment o f Parent Receivable from Dutch Subsidiary, Exit Fee Letter and ancillary documents related thereto." To approve the above resolution, Bondholders representing more than 2/3 of the Voting Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the Bondholders' Meeting must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to have a quorum, at least 1/2 of the Voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting. Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' Meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.) Individual Bondholders may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising the Bond Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post to post@nordictrustee.no, +47 22 87 94 10, or Nordic Trustee ASA, PO Box 1470 Vika, 0116 Oslo, Norway). In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form is executed, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' Meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the beneficial ownership of the Bonds. For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' Meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond Trustee, to notify the Bond Trustee by telephone or by e-mail (at set out at the first page of this letter) by no later than 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Business Day before the meeting takes place.
