Re: In re Viking Offshore (USA) Inc., et al,, Case Nos. 08-31219, 31222, 31224, 31226 and 31228; in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division
As you maybe aware, Viking Offshore (USA), Viking Prospector Inc., Viking Producer Inc., Viking Century Inc., and Viking Drilling ASA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Houston, Texas on February 29, 2008. The cases all are being administered under Case Nos. 08-31219, 31222 and 31224. Our firm, Thompson & Knight LLP, has been retained as counsel by Norsk Tillitsmann-ASA, as Loan Trustee, with regard to these Chapter 11 cases.
Chapter 11 is a reorganization process designed to allow a company and its creditors to restructure the balance sheet of an insolvent entity. Typically, a company stays in control of the management and operations of its business and must seek approval from the Bankruptcy Court before transacting any business outside the ordinary course. Such a Company has an initial exclusive period of time to propose a plan of reorganization of 120 days (plus extensions granted at the court's discretion), after which the creditors are entitled to file their own restructuring plan. The current exclusivity period expires June 28, 2008. On May 22, 2008, the Viking debtors filed a motion requesting this exclusive period be extended to December 31, 2008. As of today, no hearing has been scheduled on the motion.
The Bankruptcy Court has set July 16,2008, as the deadline to file a proof of claim. The office hours are from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Each proof of claim must be received by the Bankruptcy Clerk's Office by such deadline. The address of the Bankruptcy Clerk's Office is, as follows:
United States Bankruptcy Court P.O. Box 61288 Houston, TX 77208
You should contact your own layer regarding the filing of a proof of claim or proof of interest under the circumstances of these cases.
The filing of these Chapter 11 cases was precipitated by a seizure of the vessel Viking Producer instituted by the Gulf Copper Yard based on nonpayment. The Viking debtors filed

Chapter 11 in order to obtain the release of the Viking Producer. Shortly after filing, such debtors reached an agreement with the yard for storage of the Viking Producer rig, including its release from the maritime seizure. The debtors have established a cash management procedure pursuant to bankruptcy regulations, employed a Chief Financial Officer in Norway, a lawyer in Norway, and general bankruptcy counsel in Houston. In addition, the debtors have retained R.S. Platou USA Inc. as broker to market and sell the rigs that contribute the primary assets of the debtors. Platou has an exclusive listing for two months, beginning April 22,2008, after which the debtors are free to contract with other brokers, though Platou retains a right to a commission under certain conditions that are typical in the industry.
At least two creditors have filed notices that they have perfected maritime liens against the assets. It is our view that number will increase substantially. Under U.S. maritime law, a vendor that provides necessaries to an owner will be granted a maritime lien that has priority over a ship's mortgage lien. Because of this provision, it appears that the vast majority of the debtors' trade vendors are or will be secured creditors.
From the evidence provided by the debtors to us, it appears that there currently are few employees at Viking Offshore: 3 full time (Heagney, Driver and Ettinger), 1 part-time, 1 temporary and 4 contract employees. The parent Viking Drilling ASA has only 1 employee, being Mr. Niels Feilberg in Oslo. There are no other employees at this time.
Through Platou, it is the Viking debtors intent to sell the Producer rig to a purchaser that the debtors hope will assume the existing refurbishment contracts which are in place. The debtors' attorneys have explained that Viking Offshore (USA) has entered into contracts with vendors, suppliers, and engineers to provide $52 mm USD worth of future work. These are services and materials that have not been performed or delivered and the companies are trying to avoid breaching those contracts, as such breaches likely would create additional claims in the bankruptcy. If the companies sells the Producer without those contracts being assumed, the companies will have to reject them, which may create "rejection damage," which could be allowed as unsecured claims against the debtors.
Platou was retained by order of the court on April 22, 2008, and has been engaged in distributing information to prospective purchasers and scheduling inspections of the rigs since that date. Platou advises that interest by potential purchasers is typical for this type of engagement and that the marketing process may last through the summer, though offers may start being submitted at any time.
We are advised that debtors currently have about $16 mm USD in available and unencumbered cash. Debtors believe this amount is sufficient to liquidate and get through the Chapter 11 sale process. Thus, the debtors advise that they have no need to borrow further.
The debtors' attorneys advise there are a total of $18 mm USD of maritime liens being asserted, comprised principally of vendor debt incurred in connection with refurbishing of the Producer rig. The debtors believe there is no unsecured debt, since they believe that all vendors will have maritime liens against the Producer rig. This $18 mm USD is in addition to the $52 mm USD of contract obligations mentioned above.

Debtors also believe that all $18 mm USD of maritime liens will prime (that is, come ahead of) the first preferred ship's mortgage of Norsk Tillitsmann with respect to the vessel Viking Producer. It does not appear that those maritime liens, assuming they are valid, would prime the mortgages on the other two rigs since none of the services and materials were provided to those rigs.
Going forward, we will continue to monitor the cases and take action as directed by Norsk Tillitsmann. Please note that the Loan Trustee assumes no obligation to the Warrantholders by sending the within notice, beyond the obligations that exist under the Loan Agreement dated December 17, 2007.
