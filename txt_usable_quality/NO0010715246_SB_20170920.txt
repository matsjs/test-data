Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Nordic Trustee AS is appointed ss Bond Trustee for the Bond is----rnpntiorspd shnvp
Unless otherwise stated herein, all capitalised terms used but not otherwise defined in this summons (the "Summons") shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement for the Bond Issue originally dated 30 September 2014 (the "Bond Agreement"). References to "Clauses" in this Summons are references to clauses in the Bond Agreement.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. PAST EVENTS.
The Issuer faced, during the course of 2016, serious problems in paying the interest on the above Bond. In the years from 2014, the time when the Bond was issued, the Issuer has experienced losses every year, which has led to a weakening o f the equity position in the balance sheet. Without any relief in the financial cost, and strengthening of the equity side, the Board would have had no other option than filing for bankruptcy.
Due to these facts, the Issuer put themselves in contact with Nordic Trustee AS, in capacity of trustee for the Bond Issue, and proposed firstly a stand still agreement, and secondly a restructuring of the Bond agreement, through a Debt-to-Equity Swap. In the Bondholders meeting on the 4th July 2017, the Issuers proposal o f a stand still and restructuring was adopted. The adopted proposal o f the 4th July 2017 concluded with the conversion of NOK 54.000.000 of the principal amount under the loan and interest payments of NOK 4 464 096 were converted into in total 90% o f the share capital in the Issuer (the "July Proposal"). The proposal set out in this summons is a supplement to the July Proposal by including all interest and interest for late payment due in 2017 to the restructuring..
Due to the financial situation of the Issuer, there is a need for the Issuer to ask the bondholders to release the Issuer from its' obligation to pay interest for 2017 (interest not included in the July Proposal). Further, to secure equal treatment o f the bondholders, that the interest amount (NOK 4 464 096) to be paid through issuing o f new shares in the July Proposal is issued to all bondholders, not only the holders o f the interest claim due on the 31 January 2017 and on the 30 April 2017. The Issuer proposes that:
a) the interest due on the 3 1st January 2017, including interest for late payment; b) the interest due on the 30 April 2017, including interest for late payment;

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

c) the interest due on the 31 July 2017, including interest for late payment; and d) the interest accrued between the 31 July 2017 and the accomplish date for the Proposal (set
out in clause 2 below), including interest for late payment;
(the "Interest Claims")
except for the interest amount o f NOK 4 464 096 set out in the July Proposal will be written down to zero. Interest accrued on the bond issue between the accomplish date for the Proposal and 3 1st January 2018 will be set to zero.
To secure an equal treatment o f the Bondholders and the holders the Interest Claims, the payment mechanism will be to convert the Interest Claims into bonds in the bond issue before the bond issue is written down.
The bond issue will thereafter be partly converted into shares with a total ownership of 90% o f the shares in the Issuer by the Bondholders.
The remaining outstanding amount under the bond issue will be NOK 54 000 000 after the conversion and will start to accrue interest from 31 January 2018 at a fix rate o f 8 per cent (as set out in the July Proposal). Interest payments to be made on the 3 1st July and 3 1st January (as set out in the July Proposal), with the first interest payment to be on the 3 1st July 2018.

Bondholders are hereby summoned to a Bondholders' meeting:

Time: Place:

representative of the Bond Trustee, unless otherwise decided by the Bondholders' Meeting).. 4. Request for adoption of Proposal:

It is proposed that the Bondholders' meeting resolve the following: "The Bondholders' Meeting approves the Proposal as described in section 1 of the Summons.

The Bond Trustee is hereby authorised to enter into the necessary agreements in connection with the decisions made at the Bondholders' Meeting, and entering into any such other agreements as contemplated by the Proposal"

-3 -

To approve the above resolution, Bondholders representing at least 2/3 o f the Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the meeting must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to have a quorum, at least 5/10 o f the voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting. If the proposal is not adopted, the Bond Agreement will remain unchanged.
Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner o f the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.)
The individual bondholder may authorise the Nordic Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Nordic Trustee to vote, must then be returned to Nordic Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page o f this ietter for further details).
At the Bondholders' Meeting votes may be cast based on bonds held at close o f business on the day prior to the date o f the Bondholders' Meeting. In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to Nordic Trustee, to notify Nordic Trustee by telephone or by e-mail (mail@nordictrustee.com) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
Yours sincerely
