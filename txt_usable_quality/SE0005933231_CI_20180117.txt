Press release issued by Aligera on 2018-01-16:
Aligera AB (publ)'s subsidiary, Aligera Holding AB (publ), and the bondholder committee have agreed on an extended standstill period
As announced in the press release dated 9 November 2017, Aligera AB (publ)'s subsidiary, Aligera Holding AB (publ) (the "Subsidiary"), has entered into a standstill agreement with a group of the larger bondholders (the "Bondholder Committee") of the Subsidiary's SEK 500,000,000 senior secured bonds (ISIN SE0005933231) (the "Bonds"). The Subsidiary and the Bondholder Committee have agreed on an extended standstill period until 22 January 2018 in order to give the parties sufficient time to continue the discussions in relation to a potential out of court restructuring of the Aligera group. A potential out of court restructuring would include that a substantial amount of the outstanding amount under the Bonds is converted to equity in the form of shares and/or written off. The amount of debt reduction necessary to be granted for the Subsidiary to become financially viable long term is subject to further considerations and discussions. The implementation of the out of court restructuring, including the conversion or write off of Bonds, is subject to a written procedure where the bondholders formally resolve on the terms for the restructuring.
