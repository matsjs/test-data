A. Request
Background
The Agent has on 5 May 2015 sent a notice of default (the " Notice of Default") to the Issuer pursuant to Clause 14.1 of the Terms and Conditions. The Notice of Default was sent after the Agent had concluded that the Issuer was in breach of Clause 11.1.1(a) of the Term s and Conditions since the Issuer had not provided its audited consolidated annual accounts for the financial year 2014, prepared in accordance with the applicable Accounting Principles by no later than four months after the end of the financial y ear (the " Breach").
Pursuant to Clause 11.1.1(a) of the Term s and Conditions, the Issuer is obliged to make available the following information to the Agent and on its website:
"from 31 December 2014, as soon as the same become available, but in any event within four (4) months after the end of each financial year, its audited consolidated annual accounts for that financial y ear prepared in accordance with the applicable Accounting Principles;".
The definition of "Accounting Principles" as set out in Clause 1.1 of the Term s and Conditions reads as follows:
""Accounting Principles" means (i) until 31 Decem ber 2014, the generally accepted local accounting principles, standards and practices in D enm ark and, (ii) thereafter, international financial reporting standards ("IFRS") within the meaning of Regulation 1606/2002/EC (or as otherwise adopted or am ended from time to tim e), each as applied by the Issuer in preparing its annual consolidated financial statem ents."
The "generally accepted local accounting principles, standards and practices in Denm ark" are hereinafter referred to as " Local G A A P ".
The Issuer made available its audited consolidated annual accounts in respect of the financial y e a r ended 31 D ecem ber 2014 (the "Annual A c c o u n ts ") on 10 March 2015. Those Annual Accounts were prepared in accordance with IFRS, in good faith of the Issuer believing that it was permitted and, also required, to do so.
It is the Agent's opinion that Local G AAP was the applicable Accounting Principles in respect of the Annual Accounts (and not IFRS).
In this context, it should be noted that in the Annual Accounts, the am ount of the bond debt has been determ ined to the m arket value (instead of the nominal am ount), which is in accordance with IFRS. Furthermore, the Issuer has not been able to confirm to the Agent that it would have been in compliance with its financial undertakings set out in Clause 13.1 of the Term s and Conditions, if the Annual Accounts had been prepared in accordance with Local GAAP. The Agent has requested the Issuer to provide it with calculations of the financial undertakings set out in Clause 13.1 of the Term s and Conditions as if the Annual Accounts had been prepared in accordance with Local GAAP. The Issuer has how ever responded that it is not able to provide such calculations. It is therefore not possible for the A gent to verify whether the Issuer would have been in compliance with its financial undertakings should the Annual Accounts have been prepared in accordance with Local GAAP.
The Breach could in the opinion of the Agent, at least theoretically, have been remedied if the Issuer had provided a new set of audited annual consolidated accounts prepared in accordance with Local GAAP within the twenty (20) Business Day's remedy period provided for in Clause 14.1(b) of the Terms and Conditions. The Issuer has however not provided a new set of audited annual consolidated accounts prepared in accordance with Local GAAP and consequently an Event of Default occurred pursuant to Clause 14.1 (b) of the Term s and Conditions as of 3 June 2015 and is still continuing.
On 18 May 2015 the Agent initiated, on the Issuer's request a Written Procedure in order to let the Noteholders approve or reject an unconditional w aiver request made by the Issuer in
2

relation to the Breach. That waiver request was subsequently withdrawn by the Issuer on 5 June 2015, due to the fact that the Issuer and its majority owner CataCap 1 K/S, had entered into negotiations with a group of Noteholders in order to agree on conditions for the Noteholders to approve a waiver in relation to the Breach and to find a more satisfactory solution to the structure of the financial covenants and the Issuer's leverage ratio. The negotiations between the group of Noteholders and the Issuer and CataCap 1 K/S has resulted in inter alia the following conditions being put on the Issu e r and its owner: i) new equity shall be injected into the Issuer in an am ount of at least DKK 50,000,000 (the " Equity Injection"), ii) the bond debt shall be determined at its nominal am ount for the calculations of any financial covenants, iii) the leverage ratio requirem ent is tem porarily eased in combination with a postponement of the reduction of the covenant threshold and iv) an obligation on the Issuer to repurchase parts of the outstanding Notes. Hence, this Request is proposed by the Issuer.
Due to the ongoing w aiver process in respect of the Breach, the Issuer has, in order to be able to more adequately describe the risks in the prospectus, decided to delay the admission to trading of the Notes on the Regulated Market of NASDAQ OMX, as required pursuant to Clause 12.9.1 of the Term s and Conditions. The Issuer's intention is to adm it the Notes to trading on the Regulated Market of NASDAQ OMX as soon as possible after the waiver process has been finalised and all relevant preparations has been made by the Issuer for that purpose.
Request
The Issuer is hereby requesting the N oteholders' consent to:
1) a w aiver in respect of the Breach and the su bseq ue nt Event of Default following therefrom and to prepare its annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 D ecem ber 2014 in accordance with IFRS as set out below:
"The Noteholders agree to (i) waive a breach by the Issuer of Clause 11.1.1(a) of the Term s and Conditions by not preparing its audited consolidated annual accounts in respect of the financial yea r ended 31 D ecem ber 2014 in accordance with the applicable Accounting Principles, and the Event of Default that has occurred as a result thereof, and consequently, the rights the Agent may have (on its own initiative or as instructed by the Noteholders) to accelerate or take other actions in relation to the Notes pursuant to Clause 14 of the Term s and Conditions shall in this regard be foreclosed and (ii) grant a consent to the effect that IFRS shall be deemed to have been the applicable Accounting Principles in respect of the financial yea r ended 31 December 2014."; and
2) an am endm ent and restatement of the Terms and Conditions as set out in Appendix 1 hereto, being a comparison version showing the changes between the original Terms and Conditions and the Proposed Amended and Restated Terms and Conditions (the " Proposed Am ended and Restated Term s and Conditions").
The main am endm ents to the Term s and Conditions included in the Proposed Am ended and Restated Terms and Conditions are as follows:
· it is explicitly stated that the bond debt shall in any calculations relating to the Net Debt to EBITDA ratio be valued at its total aggregate nominal amount outstanding at the relevant time;
· an obligation of the Issuer to offer to repurchase notes in an am ount of at least 50% of the amount of the Equity Injection;
· an obligation of the Issuer to pay 50 % of the net proceeds of certain litigation into the account being pledged under an account pledge agreement and to offer to repurchase Notes once the amounts standing to the credit of such account exceeds SEK 10,000,000;
3

· a tem porary ease in the leverage ratio requirem ent to 7.00:1 until but excluding 31 D ecem ber 2016 in combination with a postponem ent of the first test date for the financial covenants to 31 December 2015; and
· a postponement of the requirement to admit the Notes to trading on the Regulated Market of NASDAQ OMX (to occur on 23 November 2015 at latest).

b) an account pledge ag re e m e n t between the Issu e r and the Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties) pursuant to which the Issuer pledges a certain escrow account to the Secured Parties, represented by the Agent; and
c) an am en dm en t and security confirm ation agreem ent in order to, in relation to the share pledge agreem ent in respect of the shares in the Issuer, reflect the increase of the share capital of the Issuer following the Equity Injection and for the Issuer to confirm that the existing security granted pursuant to the Security Documents is not affected by the Proposed Am ended and Restated Term s and Conditions, to be executed by the owners of the Issuer, the other security providers and the Agent.
The Issuer shall provide the Agent with evidence, to the Agent's satisfaction, that the above conditions have been satisfied. The Agent shall immediately upon the receipt of such evidence inform the Noteholders that the Request has been effective and that the Amended and Restated Terms and Conditions shall come into effect on that date by way of sending the Noteholders a notice, publishing a press release and making an announcement on its website.

Voting rights
Anyone who wishes to participate in the Written Procedure must on 3 July 2015 (the "Record Date"):
(i) be registered on the Securities Account as a direct registered owner (direktregistrerad ägare); or
(ii) be registered on the Securities Account as authorised nominee (förvaltare),

1. You can ask the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Notes on your behalf to vote in its own name as instructed by you.
2. You can obtain a power of attorney or other authorisation from the authorised nominee or other intermediary and send in your own voting form based on the authorisation.

Whether one or both of these options are available to you depends on the agreement between you and the authorised nominee or other intermediary that holds the Notes on your behalf (and the agreement between the intermediaries, if there are more than one).
