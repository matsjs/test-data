To the bondholders in:
- ISIN NO 001031608.6 - 9.75 per cent Petromena ASA Callable Bond Issue 2006/1012 and-
- ISIN NO 001039578.3 - 10.85 per cent Petromena ASA Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2010
We refer to the Bondholder Meeting Summons dated 25 February 2009, issued in connection with the above-mentioned Bond issues. Defined terms in this notice shall have the same meanings given to them in the Bondholder Meeting Summons.
In advance of the Bondholders' meetings for the above-mentioned Bonds, we wish to clarify certain points in relation to the Bondholder Meeting Summons, as set out below.
1. Inter-creditor agreement
The Bondholder Meeting Summons provides that the security improvement for both Bond Loan Agreements is subject to an inter-creditor agreement being entered into between the Loan Trustee (representing the bondholders) and the lenders under the First Priority Debt, such inter-creditor agreement to be on terms and conditions customary for a first priority lender and security holder in international finance transactions, reflecting the waterfall structure.
We would like to confirm that we, as Loan Trustee, will not enter into any inter-creditor agreement in respect of the First Priority Debt for Rig 1, unless that intercreditor agreement has first been approved by Bondholders' meetings of each of the above referenced Bond Loans.
2. Loan Terms
The Bondholder Meeting Summons also provides that any new or revised loan agreement or other financing arrangement related to Rig I must be approved by the Loan Trustee, and that the Loan Trustee shall provide its approval to the loan arrangement if it is satisfied that it is on reasonable market terms and would not materially prejudice the recovery of the Bondholders.
We would like to confirm that before providing approval we, as Loan Trustee, or the Bondholders' Meeting (if such proposal is put forward to such Bondholders' Meeting), will need to be satisfied that putting in place the First Priority Debt will not negatively impact the ability of the Company to fulfil on a timely basis any of its payment obligations (whether interest or principal) under the 9.75% Bonds and the 10.85% Bonds.
3. Effectiveness of Resolutions
The Bondholder Meeting Summons provides that all the Proposals for the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue and the USDm 264 Bond Issue are subject to USD 300 million of 1st lien debt with better priority than the NOK 2,000 Bond Issues in Rig I being secured.
