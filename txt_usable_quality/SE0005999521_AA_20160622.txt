A notice shall be deemed to be sent by way of press release if it is made available to the public within Sweden promptly and in a non-discriminatory manner.

As continuing security for the due and punctual fulfilment of the Issuer's obligations under

the Finance Documents, the Issuer, the Shareholder and the Second Shareholder shall pledge

(i) all shares in the Issuer in accordance with the Share Pledge Agreement, (ii) all its present

and future money claims under the Shareholder Loan Claim Agreement in accordance with

the Shareholder Loan Claim Pledge Agreement, (iii) the Escrow Account and all funds held

on the Escrow Account from time to time in accordance with the Escrow Account Pledge

Agreement, in favour of the Holders and the Agent.

5.2

The Issuer shall ensure that the Security Documents and all documents relating thereto are

duly executed (in favour of the Agent and the Holders (represented by the Agent), if

applicable) and that such documents are legally valid, perfected, enforceable and in full force

and effect according to their terms. The Issuer shall execute and/or procure the execution of

such further documentation as the Agent may reasonably require in order for the Holders and

the Agent to at all times maintain the security position envisaged hereunder.

5.3

The Agent will hold the security created under the Security Documents on behalf of itself and

the Holders in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the Security Documents.

5.4

Except if otherwise decided by the Holders according to the procedures set out in Clauses 19

(Decisions by Holders) to 21 (Written Procedure), the Agent is, without first having to obtain

the Holders' consent, entitled to enter into binding agreements with the Group Companies or

third parties if it is, in the Agent's sole discretion, necessary for the purpose of establishing,

maintaining, altering, releasing or enforcing the security created (or to be created) under the

Security Documents or for the purpose of settling the various Holders' relative rights to the

security created under the Security Documents, respectively. The Agent is entitled to take all

measures available to it according to the Security Documents.

5.5

If the Bonds are declared due and payable according to Clause 17 (Termination o f the Bonds)

or following the Final Redemption Date, the Agent is, without first having to obtain the

Holders' consent, entitled to enforce the security created under the Security Documents, in

such manner and under such conditions that the Agent finds acceptable (if in accordance with

the Security Documents, respectively).

5.6

If a Holders' meeting has been convened to decide on the termination of the Bonds and/or the

enforcement of all or any of the security created under all or any of the Security Documents,

the Agent is obligated to take actions in accordance with the Holders' decision regarding the

security created under the Security Documents. However, if the Bonds are not terminated due

to that the cause for termination has ceased or due to any other circumstance mentioned in

these Terms and Conditions, the Agent shall not enforce any of the security created under the

Security Documents. If the Holders, without any prior initiative from the Agent or the Issuer,

have made a decision regarding termination of the Bonds and enforcement of any of the

security created under the Security Documents in accordance with the procedures set out in

Clauses 19 (Decisions by Holders) to 21 (Written Procedure), the Agent shall promptly

declare the Bonds terminated and enforce the security created under the Security Documents.

The Agent is however not liable to take action if the Agent considers cause for termination

14

and/or acceleration not to be at hand, unless the instructing Holders in writing commit to holding the Agent indemnified and, at the Agent's own discretion, grant sufficient security for the obligation.

5.7

Funds that the Agent receives (directly or indirectly) on behalf of the Holders in connection

with the enforcement of any or all of the security created under the Security Documents

constitute escrow funds (Sw. redovisningsmedel) according to the Escrow Funds Act

(Sw. lag (1944:181) om redovisningsmedel) and must be held on a separate account on behalf

of the Holders. The Agent shall promptly arrange for payments of such funds in accordance

with Clause 18 (Distribution o f proceeds) as soon as reasonably practicable. If the Agent

deems it appropriate, it may, in accordance with Clause 5.8, instruct the CSD to arrange for

payment to the Holders.

5.8

For the purpose of exercising the rights of the Holders and the Agent under these Terms and

Conditions and for the purpose of distributing any funds originating from the enforcement of

any security created under the Security Documents, the Issuer irrevocably authorises and

empowers the Agent to act in the name of the Issuer, and on behalf of the Issuer, to instruct

the CSD to arrange for payment to the Holders in accordance with Clause 5.7. To the extent

permissible by law, the powers set out in this Clause 5.8 are irrevocable and shall be valid for

as long as any Bonds remain outstanding. The Issuer shall immediately upon request by the

Agent provide the Agent with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in

form and substance to the Agent's satisfaction), which the Agent deems necessary for the

purpose of carrying out its duties under Clause 5.7. Especially, the Issuer shall, upon the

Agent's request, provide the Agent with a written power of attorney empowering the Agent to

change the bank account registered with the CSD to a bank account in the name of the Agent

and to instruct the CSD to pay out funds originating from an enforcement in accordance with

Clause 5.7 to the Holders through the CSD.

6.

transferees upon completed transfer.

6.3

relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden, where action for that

purpose is required. Each Holder must inform itself about, and observe, any applicable

restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds, (due to, e.g., its

nationality, its residency, its registered address or its place(s) of business). Each Holder must

ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.

15

6.5

For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the above, a Holder which allegedly has

purchased Bonds in contradiction to mandatory restrictions applicable may nevertheless utilise

its voting rights under these Terms and Conditions and shall be entitled to exercise its full

rights as a Holder hereunder in each case until such allegations have been resolved.

7.

of the Bonds. At the request of the Agent, the Issuer shall promptly obtain such information

and provide it to the Agent.

7.4

For the purpose of or in connection with any Holders' Meeting or any Written Procedure, the

Issuing Agent shall be entitled to obtain information from the debt register kept by the CSD

of the Agent obtain information from the debt register and provide it to the Agent.

The Issuer shall issue any necessary power of attorney to such Persons employed by the Agent,

as notified by the Agent, in order for such individuals to independently obtain information

directly from the debt register kept by the CSD in respect of the Bonds. The Issuer may not

revoke any such power of attorney unless directed by the Agent or unless consent thereto is

given by the Holders.

7.6

At the request of the Agent, the Issuer shall promptly instruct the Issuing Agent to obtain

information from the debt register kept by the CSD in respect of the Bonds and provide it to

the Agent.

8.

RIGHT TO ACT ON BEHALF OF A HOLDER

If any Person other than a Holder wishes to exercise any rights under the Finance Documents,

it must obtain a power of attorney (or, if applicable, a coherent chain of powers of attorney),

a certificate from the authorised nominee or other sufficient proof of authorisation for such

Person.

8.2

A Holder may issue one or several powers of attorney to third parties to represent it in relation

to some or all of the Bonds held by it. Any such representative may act independently under

8.3

The Agent shall only have to examine the face of a power of attorney or other proof of

authorisation that has been provided to it pursuant to Clause 8.1 and 8.2 and may assume that

it has been duly authorised, is valid, has not been revoked or superseded and that it is in full

force and effect, unless otherwise is apparent from its face.

repurchase of any Bonds, shall be made to such Person who is registered as a Holder on the

Initial Bond Issue or a Subsequent Bond Issue, but not in respect of trading in the secondary

17.2

If the right to terminate the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government

authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the

period of appeal has expired in order for cause of termination to be deemed to exist.

17.3

The Issuer is obliged to inform the Agent immediately if any circumstance of the type

specified in Clause 17.1 should occur. Should the Agent not receive such information, the

Agent is entitled to assume that no such circumstance exists or can be expected to occur,

provided that the Agent does not have knowledge of such circumstance. The Agent is under

no obligations to make any investigations relating to the circumstances specified in

Clause 17.1. The Issuer shall further, at the request ofthe Agent, provide the Agent with details

of any circumstances referred to in Clause 17.1 and provide the Agent with all documents that

may be of significance for the application of this Clause 17.

17.4

The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Agent according to Clause 17.3 if informing the Agent

would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with NASDAQ OMX

Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable). If such a conflict would exist

pursuant to the listing contract with NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (or any other Regulated

Market, as applicable) or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek the

approval from NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) or

undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with

the Agent, in order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to Clause 17.3.

17.5

If the Agent has been notified by the Issuer or has otherwise determined that there is a default

under these Terms and Conditions according to Clause 17.1, the Agent shall decide, within 20

Business Days of the day of notification or determination, if the Bonds shall be declared

terminated. If the Agent has decided not to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall, at the earliest

possible date, notify the Holders that there exists a right of termination and obtain instructions

from the Holders according to the provisions in Clause 19 (Decisions by Holders). If the

Holders vote in favour of termination and instruct the Agent to terminate the Bonds, the Agent

shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. However, if the cause for termination according

to the Agent's appraisal has ceased before the termination, the Agent shall not terminate the

Bonds. The Agent shall in such case, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that the

cause for termination has ceased. The Agent shall always be entitled to take the time necessary

to consider whether an occurred event constitutes an Event of Default.

17.6

If the Holders, without any prior initiative to decision from the Agent or the Issuer, have made

a decision regarding termination in accordance with Clause 19 (Decisions by Holders), the

Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. The Agent is however not liable to take

action if the Agent considers cause for termination not to be at hand, unless the instructing

Holders agree in writing to indemnify and hold the Agent harmless from any loss or liability

and, if requested by the Agent in its discretion, grant sufficient security for such indemnity.

17.7

If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in this Clause 17,

the Agent shall take every reasonable measure necessary to recover the amounts outstanding

under the Bonds.

prematurely according to this Clause 17 without relevant decision by the Agent or following

instructions from the Holders' pursuant to Clause 19 (Decisions by Holders).

17.9

If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with this Clause 17 (Termination o f

the Bonds), the Issuer shall redeem all Bonds with an amount per Bond equal to 105.00 per

cent. of the Nominal Amount or, if the Bonds are declared due and payable on or after the

First Call Date, at the applicable Call Option Amount.

o f the Bonds), all payments by the Issuer relating to the Bonds shall be distributed in the

following order of priority, in accordance with the instructions of the Agent:

(b) secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of accrued but unpaid Interest under the Bonds (Interest due on an earlier Interest Payment Date to be paid before any Interest due on a later Interest Payment Date);

(c) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid principal under the Bonds; and

(d) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under the Finance Documents.

Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer. The application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal.

18.2

If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in

Clause 18.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way of a

corresponding distribution in accordance with Clause 18.1.

18.3

Funds that the Agent receives (directly or indirectly) in connection with the termination of the

Bonds and/or enforcement of any or all of the security created under the Security Documents

constitute escrow funds according to the Escrow Funds Act and must be held on a separate

interest-bearing account on behalf of the Holders and the other interested parties. The Agent

shall arrange for payments of such funds in accordance with this Clause 18 as soon as

reasonably practicable.

28

18.4

If the Issuer or the Agent shall make any payment under this Clause 18, the Issuer or the Agent,

as applicable, shall notify the Holders of any such payment at least 15 Business Days before

the payment is made. Such notice shall specify the Record Date, the payment date and the

amount to be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any Interest due but unpaid the Record

Date specified in Clause 9.1 shall apply.

19.

than by way of a Written Procedure, it shall be dealt with at a Holders' Meeting.

19.3

The Agent may refrain from convening a Holders' Meeting or instigating a Written Procedure

if (i) the suggested decision must be approved by any Person in addition to the Holders and

The quorum requirement in Clause 19.8 shall not apply to such second Holders' Meeting or Written Procedure.
Any decision which extends or increases the obligations of the Issuer or the Agent, or limits, reduces or extinguishes the rights or benefits of the Issuer or the Agent, under the Finance Documents shall be subject to the Issuer's or the Agent's consent, as appropriate.

Information about decisions taken at a Holders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure shall promptly be sent by notice to the Holders and published on the websites of the Issuer and the Agent, provided that a failure to do so shall not invalidate any decision made or voting result achieved. The minutes from the relevant Holders' Meeting or Written Procedure shall at the request of a Holder be sent to it by the Issuer or the Agent, as applicable.

the Agent may attend along with each oftheir representatives, counsels and assistants. Further,

Any liability towards the Issuer which is incurred by the Agent in acting under, or in relation to, the Finance Documents shall not be subject to set-off against the obligations of the Issuer to the Holders under the Finance Documents.
Replacement of the Agent
Subject to Clause 23.4.6, the Agent may resign by giving notice to the Issuer and the Holders, in which case the Holders shall appoint a successor Agent at a Holders' Meeting convened by the retiring Agent or by way of Written Procedure initiated by the retiring Agent.
Subject to Clause 23.4.6, if the Agent is insolvent, the Agent shall be deemed to resign as Agent and the Issuer shall within 10 Business Days appoint a successor Agent which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable company which regularly acts as agent under debt issuances.
A Holder (or Holders) representing at least 10 per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount may, by notice to the Issuer (such notice may only be validly given by a Person who is a Holder on the Business Day immediately following the day on which the notice is received by the Issuer and shall, if given by several Holders, be given by them jointly), require that a Holders' Meeting is held for the purpose of dismissing the Agent and appointing a new Agent. The Issuer may, at a Holders' Meeting convened by it or by way of Written Procedure initiated by it, propose to the Holders that the Agent be dismissed and a new Agent appointed.
If the Holders have not appointed a successor Agent within 90 calendar days after (i) the earlier of the notice of resignation was given or the resignation otherwise took place or (ii) the Agent was dismissed through a decision by the Holders, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Agent which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable company which regularly acts as agent under debt issuances.
The retiring Agent shall, at its own cost, make available to the successor Agent such documents and records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent under the Finance Documents.
The Agent's resignation or dismissal shall only take effect upon the appointment of a successor Agent and acceptance by such successor Agent of such appointment and the execution of all necessary documentation to effectively substitute the retiring Agent.
Upon the appointment of a successor, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the Finance Documents and remain liable under the Finance Documents in respect of any action which it took or failed to take whilst acting as Agent. Its successor, the Issuer and each of the Holders shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves under the Finance Documents as they would have had if such successor had been the original Agent.
In the event that there is a change of the Agent in accordance with this Clause 23.4, the Issuer shall execute such documents and take such actions as the new Agent may reasonably require for the purpose of vesting in such new Agent the rights, powers and obligation of the Agent and releasing the retiring Agent from its further obligations under the Finance Documents.
36

Unless the Issuer and the new Agent agrees otherwise, the new Agent shall be entitled to the same fees and the same indemnities as the retiring Agent.

Clause 23.1.3), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such failure or inability is

40 Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 23.2.10 before a Holder may take any action
