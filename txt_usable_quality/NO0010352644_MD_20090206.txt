To the bondholders in:
- ISIN NO 001031608.6 - 9.75 per cent Petromena ASA Callable Bond Issue 2006/2012 - ISIN NO 001039578.3 - 10.85 per cent Petromena ASA Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2010 - ISIN NO 001035264.4 - FRN PetroRig III Pte Ltd Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2014
Oslo, 6 February 2009
Background
Petromena ASA ("the Company") has been informed by the Loan Trustee that a group of bondholders (the "Group") in the loans with ISIN NO 001031608.6 (the "NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue"), ISIN NO 001039578.3 (the "USDm 300 Bond Issue") and ISIN NO 001035264.4 (the "NOKm 1,600 Bond Issue") (together the "Loans") has instructed the Loan Trustee to summon for a bondholder meeting in the Loans ("the Summons").
Petromena's comment to the proposal
In connection with the summons initiated by a minority of the bondholders, Petromena would like to comment on the Summons.
The Company has a clear intention to co-operate and have an open and positive dialogue with the Loan Trustee and the bondholders in the Loans.
Petromena is working intense with the financing of the three new building rigs, currently focusing on Petrorig 1 which is the first rig to be delivered. The Company has asked the bondholders in the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue and the USDm 300 Bond Issue to allow for a financing of Petrorig 3 by increasing the allowed carve-out for first lien debt related to Petrorig 1 from USDm 200 to USDm 300. The Company believes that securing financing for Petrorig 1 is of greatest importance now, and the dialogue with banks is good. However, this process will be jeopardized if the bondholders refuse to accept the increased carve-out related to Petrorig 1 shortly.
Furthermore, the Company has done its outmost to postpone the second last yard installments for Petrorig 3 from January 2009 to delivery of such rig in January 2010. Finally, the Company is (as already communicated to the market) working actively to sell at least one of the newbuild drilling rigs. The Company consider themselves to be the best party to lead and carry out such sale. The announcement regarding a MOU for Petrorig 3 of approximately USDm 540 should be a solid evidence of this.
From the time when some of the bondholders in the NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue and the USDm 300 Bond Issue demanded that a legal advisor was appointed to represent the bondholders at the cost of the Company in late December 2008, the Company has covered GBP 100,000 of legal costs so far to the law firm Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP ("Bingham").

On 2 February 2009, the Company announced their intention to meet the Group's request to hire a financial advisor representing the bondholders in the Loans at a reasonable cost. The Company agreed that the financial advisor should provide financial advisory services to the trustee Norsk Tillitsmann on behalf of all the bondholders. The Company also agreed that these services will include conducting a business due diligence in relation to the Company, its subsidiaries, the Rig construction projects and the Petrolia Rig owned by PetroMena Ltd and advising the trustee in negotiations with the Company and other stakeholders. The Company is also prepared to cover further legal costs for the bondholders, if deemed necessary by the Loan Trustee.
In spite of the Company's willingness to cover the engagement of advisors at reasonable costs, the Company recognizes that the Group proposes to appoint a rig broker, a financial advisor and a legal advisor at their own cost.
A sale of a rig has to be controlled by the Company. The numbers of buyers is limited, and the Company talks to the potential buyers already. Having a rig broker which is representing the bondholders trying to sell the rigs will only contribute to push the potential price down. A rig broker appointed by the bondholders will have no authority to act on behalf of the Company. All potential buyers will anyway need to communicate with the Company and the rig manager. The Company has already appointed Pareto Securities AS as its own financial advisor to assist with securing financing for Petrorig 1. If the Trustee and the bondholders need their own financial advisor, the Company has already agreed to cover the reasonable costs of such advisor. However, the Company finds it unreasonable to follow the Group's request to pay enormous fees to such financial advisor if any rigs are sold or any financing is raised, even in situations where such financial advisor has not contributed. If the bondholders' accept the proposal to appoint the financial advisor and rig broker, their huge fees together with fees to legal advisor have to be covered by themselves.
Conclusion
The Company is willing to cover reasonable costs related to bondholders' legal and financial advisor. However, the terms indicated by AMA Capital Partners (the financial advisor) are unacceptable for the Company. The same is the engagement of a rig broker.
All parties involved should cooperate with the purpose of establishing the necessary financing of the rigs and the Company will continue to obtain optimal solution with regard to possible sale of rigs.
