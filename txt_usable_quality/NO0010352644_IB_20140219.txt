To the bondholders in: ISIN: NO 001035264.4 - FRN PetroRig III Pte Ltd Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue
2007/2014 (the "FRN Bond Loan")
Oslo, 19 February 2014
Prolonged maturity date. Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed as loan trustee for the holders of bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond loan. The maturity date for the FRN Bond Loan is in accordance with the loan agreement, registered with the Norwegian Security Depositary ("VPS") to be on 20 February 2014. As the Bondholders are informed of was the entire FRN Bond Loan on 3 April 2009 declared to be in default and due for immediate payment. Following the acceleration of the loan the Bondholders have received several payments. There will however not be made any payments to the Bondholders on the Maturity Date as registered in VPS. As it is possible that further payments may be made to the Bondholders in the time ahead the maturity date in VPS will - purely for practical reasons - be prolonged by 1 year - until 20 February 2015 (the "New Maturity Date"). In addition to facilitate possible payments to the Bondholders the extension of the maturity date will make trading and transactions connected to the bonds easier. When the New Maturity Date is approaching the Bondholders may receive a notice from VPS. An extension of the New Maturity Date will be considered on that point in time. Bondholders requesting further information may contact Norsk Tillitsmann ASA.
Kind regards Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
