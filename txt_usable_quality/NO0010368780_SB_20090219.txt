PROPOSED FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF MALKA OIL AB - SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS MEETING
N orsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed Loan Trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the above mentioned bond issues (the "L oans") where M alka Oil AB (the "B orrow er" or "M alka O il") is the Borrower. (All capitalised terms used in this document shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Loan Agreements for the above mentioned bond issues, or in this summons).
The Borrower has approached the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to consider a proposed Financial Restructuring o f the Borrower.
Over the last six months, a number of macro factors have adversely impacted the Borrower. Foremost are the drop in oil price and the collapse o f the Russian financial markets and the resulting credit crunch. Historically, the Russian domestic oil price has been on a level o f 5560% o f the Ural Blend export price. However, in January 2009 the Russian domestic oil price was less than 30% o f the Ural Blend export price. Given that the Borrower sells all its oil produced domestically, revenues were severely impacted. In fact, M alka Oil had a negative cash net back per barrel on its production in January 2009. In addition, M alka Oil has not been able to met production expectations and increase the reserves at a satisfactorily pace.
Consequently the board o f directors and management o f M alka Oil have taken steps to address these challenges. A n extensive cost cutting program is currently being im plem ented aim ed at reducing annual costs by an expected MUSD 3-4. This involves some 30% reduction o f the labour costs in Russia and revised oil transport agreement. The full effect o f such a cost cutting program is expected to be achieved within 6-9 months. In addition, M alka Oil completed a debt restructuring with various Russian supplier in Decem ber 2008 resulting in a debt repaym ent plan o f approx MUSD 19 with the m ajority o f payments to be made in first half 2009.
Given the B orrow er's deteriorating outlook and today's challenging financial markets, it is in the B orrow er's opinion not feasible to raise capital in the public m arket based on M alka O il's current capital structure. The Financial Restrucuting is proposed to be carried out by a combination o f (i) a proposal to the Bondholders to convert their bonds into new shares in the Borrower and (ii) a Rights Issue o f MSEK 140 directed towards existing shareholders.

Attached to this summons is a letter from the board o f directors o f the B orrow er and a company presentation providing further details relevant to evaluating the proposed restructuring plan.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BORROWER
M alka Oil is an independent oil and gas production company operating in the Tom sk region in w estern Siberia, Russia. Its current position consists o f oil and gas assets for licence block no. 87 in the said region with a surface o f 1,800 square kilometres. M alka O il's licence block is surrounded by a large number o f producing oil and gas fields.
There are currently three oil fields on the licence block, namely Zapadno-Luginetskoye ("Z L "), Lower Luginetskoye ("L L ") and the Schinginskoye oil field. In addition, there are several identified but not yet drilled potentially oil bearing structures. The reserves o f the ZL and LL oil fields, which both are in production, have been classified by the Russian State Comm ittee o f Reserves ("G K Z") according to Russian standards and by DeGolyer & M acN aughton ("D & M ") in accordance with the SPE standard. The GKZ registered extractable oil and condensate reserves in the categories C1+C2 amounted to 97 million barrels at the end o f 2007. The B orrow er's own estimate o f its extractable oil and condensate reserves, C1+C2, in the three existing oil fields is currently 140-190 m illion barrels. The W estern reserve study estimation as of April 2008 amounted to 43.5 million barrels 2P and 90.6 million barrels 3P oil reserves. However, the reserve study by D&M did not take into consideration the test results from the boreholes #210 and #580. An updated study by D&M which was released in December 2008 indicated an overall increase o f original oil in place o f approx 30% compared to the estimates above.
In total, M alka Oil has invested more than MUSD 180 since start-up in 2005. Approx 50% o f this amount has been spent on drilling and some 25% on infrastructure, including significant investments in roads, drill pads, tanks, accommodation and pipeline for direct connection to Tom skayaneft which has been operational since September 2008. Up until M ay 2008, all funding to Russian subsidiaries was done in the form o f shareholder's contributions due to constraints in the existing loan agreements. However, since the remaining 1% stake in OOO STS-Service not already owned by M alka Oil was acquired in May 2008, all funding to Russian subsidiaries have been in the form o f intra-group loans.
No material guarantees have been provided to any third parties, except for the unconditional guarantees provided by OOO STS-Service towards the Loans. The figure below sets out the group debt structure as at December 2008.

Promissory notes / intra-group loan of 23.2 MUSD
In August 2008, the Company approached all its major Russian creditors and initiated negotiations with a view to restructure a large part o f the amount owed. This was to a large extent a result of the financial crisis and the credit crunch, which have had a particularly severe impact on Russia, and the fact that suppliers have in general been reluctant to continue to deliver goods and services unless outstanding receivables are settled in full. In fact, in many cases suppliers have required prepayments before entering into supplier contracts. Given the situation and the lack o f funds, the Company did not see any other viable alternatives than to restructure the debt and establish a repayment plan.
The debt restructuring process was completed in December 2008. As a result, a repayment plan o f approx M USD 19 has been agreed with 8 m ajor creditors. However, upcom ing re negotiations could further reduce the repayment am ount by up to M USD 3. A special vehicle, OOO United Siberian Leasing, was set up for the purpose o f the restructuring o f debt to Russian suppliers. In addition, the Company bought all outstanding promissory notes to avoid having any third party with a secured claim on OOO STS-Service. The majority of the repayments are to be made during first half of 2009 with the last repayment in December 2009. Approx MUSD 1 has been paid to date under the debt repayment agreement. Remaining paym ents scheduled for January, February and M arch am ount to approx M USD 10. M alka Oil is currently in intensive dialogue with the creditors to manage the repayments and avoid legal actions that could potentially block the Com pany's operations.
O f the outstanding debt to Russian suppliers, approx M USD 4 is owed to related parties. The discussions with the related parties have been carefully handled by independent board members of the Company.
In addition, OOO STS-Service has other current liabilities (various supplier debt) o f approx MUSD 7 and current assets of approx MUSD 5 (drilling equipment and material).
As at end o f December 2008, M alka Oil had a consolidated cash position o f MUSD 4 of which approx MUSD 3 was held on accounts owned directly by the parent company (Malka

Oil AB). Based on the aforementioned Russian debt restructuring and cost cutting program, in

addition to the proposed Financial Restructuring, the Borrower has identified a capital

requirem ent o f approx M USD 15.

If the proposed Financial Restructuring is com pleted successfully, the Borrower estimates that it would require a Ural Blend export price of approx USD 45-55 / bbl, depending on production level, to cover all its cash costs assuming a normalised domestic oil price. To the extent the domestic oil price remains at less than 40% o f the Ural Blend export price, Malka Oil would require a significantly higher Ural Blend export price to be cash flow break-even.

For further details, please see the enclosed letter from the board o f directors o f M alka Oil and the company presentation.

THE PROPOSED FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING
The Financial Restructuring is proposed to be carried out by a combination of;
1. Proposal to the convertible bondholders in the Toans (the "Bondholders") to have their convertible bonds, excluding any accrued interest, converted into new shares in the Borrower at a ratio of 2,097,500 new shares for each bond with a nominal value of USD 100,000. The ratio corresponds to a subscription price o f approx SEK 0.40 per share based on a SEK / USD exchange rate of 8.50. No accrued interest will be paid (this will also apply for interest with maturity 28 February 2009). The Borrower has engaged Pareto Securities AS to coordinate the process with the Bondholders. No due diligence investigations have been carried out by Pareto Securities AS with respect to the Borrower. Pareto Securities AS does not assume responsibility for the proposed Financial Restructuring and expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever in connection therewith (including but not limited to the information contained herein and in the documents enclosed to this summons).
2. Subsequent rights issue o f M SEK 140 (the "Rights Issue") carried out by way o f issuing 6 new shares for each existing share in the Borrower at a subscription price of SEK 0.07 per share. Bondholders will not be eligible to participate in the Rights Issue. HQ Bank is engaged by the Borrower as financial advisor in relation to the Rights Issue.
The proposal to Bondholders and the Rights Issue will be conditional upon the approval by shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting o f the Borrower to be held on 17 March 2009. Furthermore, an acceptance of the proposal by Bondholders will also be conditional upon the successful completion of the Rights Issue.
Each new share issued in connection with the Financial Restructuring will have a par value of SEK 0.067. The current par value per share is SEK 0.50, however, in conjunction with the Financial Restructuring the share capital per share will be reduced by SEK 0.433.
The proceeds from the Rights issue will be used to finance the B orrow er's operations going forward, primarily the repayments to Russian suppliers under the debt restructuring agreement.

N O RSK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
Following the completion o f the Financial Restructuring, the share capital o f the Borrower will be divided between (i) the Borrow er's shareholders prior to the Financial Restructuring; (ii) non-existing shareholders participating in the Rights Issue; and (iii) Bondholders converting bonds into new shares.

The table below sets out the proforma ownership prior to the Rights Issue and post the Financial Restructuring assuming that the Rights Issue is fully subscribe on a pro rata basis by existing shareholders.

Proforma ownership structure
Pre Rights Issue Existing shareholders Bondholders Sub-total
Post Financial Restructuring Existing sharcho 1ders Bondholders Total

No. of shares held (m)
336 1,678 2,0.14
2,349 1,678 4,027

Ownership interest
16.7% 83.3% 100.0%
58.3% 41.7% 100.0%

To the extent none o f the existing shareholders participate in the Rights Issue, existing shareholders will own 8.3% of the share capital post the Financial Restructuring.

Following a successful completion of the Financial Restructuring, the parent company (Malka Oil AB) will be debt free. On a group level, the debt will consist o f the remaining payments to Russian suppliers under the debt restructuring agreement entered into in December 2008.

New shares issued to Bondholders and investors participating in the Rights Issue are expected to be issued end o f April 2009.

BO R R O W ER 'S EVALUATION
A successful completion o f the proposed Financial Restructuring will be critical for the Borrower to address the liquidity situation and to continue its operations on a going concern basis. Failure to complete the Financial Restructuring would, in the board of directors' opinion, severely deteriorate values and diminish any recovery prospects for the Bondholders.
More specifically, such failure is likely to result in im m ediate actions by the Russian creditors. Such actions could be debt enforcements via the court system and possible attachment of assets and blocking / arrest o f accounts. In the event that debt to Russian creditors is not paid in accordance with the agreed repayment plan, it is not unlikely with a petition for bankruptcy. This could in turn result in a full stop o f on-going activities and failure on M alka O il's behalf to fulfd its obligations as specified in the license agreement. Implications o f such failure could in the worst case result in the Borrower loosing the license altogether.
In summary, the board o f directors o f the Borrower considers the Financial Restructuring as the only viable alternative for the Borrower to continue on a going concern basis, and also the best alternative for Bondholders to maximise recovery and preserve underlying values.

NO RSK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
For more detailed information of the Financial Restructuring, Bondholders may contact Pareto Securities AS (tel: +47 22 87 87 00).
Bondholders are invited to participate on a conference call with the Borrower on 24 February 2009 at 15:00hrs CET to address questions in relation to the Financial Restructuring. Please contact Pareto Securities AS for further information and dial-in details.

BONDHOLDERS MEETING
The proposed restructuring plan is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Loan Trustee will however point out that proposal does not seem fully balanced between the existing shareholders and the Bondholders, as no new issue rights are offered to the Bondholders. The Bondholders m ust independently evaluate whether the proposed restructuring plan is acceptable. It is recom m ended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their tax advisors, legal advisors and financial advisors regarding the effect o f the proposed restructuring plan.
Bondholders are hereby summoned to a Bondholders' meeting:

Time: Place:

27 February 2009 at 13:00hrs (CET) The premises of Norsk Tillitsmann ASA H aakon VIIs gt 1, 01061 Oslo - 7th floor

There will be a separate Bondholders' meeting for each of the Loans.

Agenda:

1. Approval o f the summons 2. Approval o f the agenda 3. Election o f two persons to co-sign the m inutes together with the chairman 4. Request for change o f the Loan Agreement

It is proposed that the Bondholders' meeting resolve the following:

a. To convert all the bonds in the Loan, excluding any accrued interest, into new shares in the Borrower, each such share with par value of SEK 0.067, at a ratio of 2,097,500 new shares for each bond with a nominal value of USD 100,000. No accrued interest will be paid (this will also apply for interest with maturity 28 February 2009).

b. Conversion o f the bonds into new shares shall be conditional upon: i. Successful completion o f the Right Issue as described in this summons; ii. The required corporate resolutions made by the extraordinary general meeting o f the Borrower to enable the Borrower to implement the Financial Restructuring;

N O R SK TIL L IT SM A N N ASA
The Loan Trustee is granted power o f attorney to make amendments to the Loan Agreement and may on behalf of the Bondholders enter into any agreement necessary as to accomplish the restructuring. The Loan Trustee is also granted the authority, on behalf of the Bondholders, to agree to any minor adjustment to the Financial Restructuring and conditions precedent needed to facilitate the implementation of the Financial Restructuring.
To approve the above resolution, Bondholders representing at least 2/3 of the bonds represented in person or by proxy at the meeting must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to have a quorum, at least 5/10 o f the voting bonds must be represented at the meeting. If the proposal is not adopted, the Loan Agreement will remain unchanged.
Please find attached a B ondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as p roof o f ownership o f the bonds and o f the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting. If the bonds are held in custody (i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS), the custodian must confirm (i) the owner o f the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal am ount o f the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.
The individual bondholder may authorise the Loan Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed B ondholder's Form, authorising Loan Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Loan Trustee in due time before the m eeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or mail - please see the first page o f this letter for further details).
In the event that bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Loan Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership o f the bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Loan Trustee, to notify the Loan Trustee by telephone or by e-mail (at set out at the first page o f this letter) no later than 16:00hrs (CET) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.

FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF MALKA OIL AB
1. BACKGROUND
1,1 Company overview
Malka Oil AB (publ) (the "Company" or "Malka Oil") is an independent oil and gas production company operating in the Tomsk region in western Siberia, Russia. Its current position consists of oil and gas assets for licence block no. 87 in the said region with a surface of 1,800 square kilometres. Malka Oil's licence block is surrounded by a large number of producing oil and gas fields, and neighbouring producers include Rosneft, Gazprom, TNK-BP, Imperial Energy and West Siberian Resources. The license block was acquired at a public auction in April 2005 giving the Company a 25 year exploration and production license.
Malka Oil is the holding company in the group. All operational activities are carried out through the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries in Russia. The legal structure of the group is shown below,

The Company's main asset is the above mentioned license block in the Tomsk region. There are currently three oil fields on the licence block, namely Zapadno-Luginetskoye ("ZL"), Lower Luginetskoye ("LL") and the Schinginskoye oil field. In addition, there are several identified but not yet drilled potentially oil bearing structures. The reserves of the ZL and LL oil fields, which both are in production, have been classified by the Russian State Committee of Reserves ("GKZ") according to Russian standards and by DeGolyer & MacNaughton ("D&M") in accordance with the SPE standard. The GKZ registered extractable oil and condensate reserves in the categories C1+C2 amounted to 97 million barrels at the end of 2007. The Company's own estimate of its extractable oil and condensate reserves according to Russian standards, C1+C2, in the three existing oil fields is currently in the interval of 140-190 million barrels. The Western reserve study estimation as of April 2008 amounted to 43.5 million barrels 2P and 90.6 million barrels 3P oil reserves.
The Western reserve study by D&M as per April 2008 did not take into consideration the test results from the boreholes #210 and #580. An updated study by D&M which was released in December 2008 indicated an overall increase of original oil in place of approx 30% compared to the estimates above. Furthermore, the development program so far has not been optimized according to SPE norms, however, future development plans will be geared towards increasing the SPE classified reserves.
In total, Malka Oil has invested more than MUSD 180 since start-up in 2005. Approx 50% of this amount has been spent on drilling and some 25% on infrastructure, including significant investments in roads, drill pads, tanks, accommodation and pipeline for direct connection to Tomskayaneft which has been operational since September 2008. Malka has also considered its own Transneft connection with an estimated capex requirement of MUSD 15, However, in the current environment such an investment is not deemed viable and an investment decision has been postponed until markets and oil price recover,
1.3 Oil production
Malka Oil commenced producing in September 2007. In total, Malka Oil has drilled or re-opened 29 wells of which 18 wells are currently producing and 11 wells are in progress for production. In January 2009, the Company produced 2,844 bpd from 16 wells compared to 2,858 bpd from 17 wells in December 2008. Malka Oil is targeting production of 4,000 bpd once all wells are on stream. The chart below shows the development of the average daily production since September 2007 until December 2008.

Average daily production (bbls)

Although production has increased steadily since start-up, Malka Oil has not been able to meet initial production targets primarily due to lower than expected productivity from new wells and disappointing results from hydrofraccing. In January 2009, average production per producing well was approx 180 bpd which is significantly below initial expectations.
Although results have been disappointing to date, the Company has gained valuable knowledge of the reservoirs and their characteristics which will enable improved accuracy and optimisation of future drilling programs. However, it should be noted that with flow rates below 200 bpd per well, it is not likely to be economically viable to drill new wells (estimated capex of approx MUSD 2.5 per well) in the current environment.

1.4 Recent developments
A number of macro factors have adversely impacted Malka Oil over the last six months. Foremost are the drop in oil price and the collapse of the Russian financial markets and the resulting credit crunch. Historically, the Russian domestic oil price has been on a level of 55-60% of the Ural Blend export price. However, in January 2009 the Russian domestic oil price was less than 30% of the Ural Blend export price. Given that Malka Oil sells all its oil production domestically, revenues were severely impacted. In fact, Malka Oil had negative cash net back per barrel on its production in January 2009.
Consequently the board of directors and management of Malka Oil have taken steps to address these challenges. An extensive cost cutting program is currently being implemented aimed at reducing annual costs by an expected MUSD 3-^4. This involves some 30% reduction of the labour costs in Russia and revised oil transport agreement. The full effect of such a cost cutting program is expected to be achieved within 6-9 months. In addition, Malka Oil entered into a debt restructuring agreement with various Russian suppliers in December 2008 resulting in a debt repayment plan of approx MUSD 19 with the majority of repayments to be made in first half 2009. The final debts payable have been reduced by up to 30% after negotiations with the various creditors.

2.1 Group debt overview

Up until May 2008, all funding to Russian subsidiaries was done in the form of shareholder's contributions due to constraints in the existing loan agreements. However, since the remaining 1% stake in OOO STS-Service not already owned by Malka Oil was acquired in May 2008, all funding to Russian subsidiaries have been in the form of intra-group loans.

2.2 OOO STS-Service debt overview

No material guarantees have been provided from OOO STS-Service to any third parties, except for the unconditional guarantees provided towards the two convertible bonds.

In August 2008, the Company approached all its major Russian creditors and initiated negotiations with a view to restructure a large part of the amount owed. This was to a large extent a result of the financial crisis and the credit crunch, which have had a particularly severe impact on Russia, and the fact that suppliers have in general been reluctant to continue to deliver goods and services unless outstanding receivables are settled in full. In fact, in many cases suppliers have required prepayments before entering into supplier contracts. Given the situation and the lack of funds, the Company did not see any other viable alternatives than to restructure the debt and establish a repayment plan. The dramatic change in the business environment did also have a severe impact on Malka Oil as the Company had to shift from rapid growth modus to no growth modus during a few months demanding extraordinary measures from the management team and board of directors.

The debt restructuring process was completed in December 2008. As a result, a repayment plan of ^tpprox MUSD 19 has been agreed with'8 major creditors. However, upcoming re-negotiations

could further reduce the repayment amount by up to MUSD 3. A special vehicle, OOO United Siberian Leasing, was set up for the purpose of the restructuring of debt to Russian suppliers. In addition, the Company bought all outstanding promissory notes to avoid having any third party with a secured claim on OOO STS-Service. The majority of the repayments are to be made during first half of 2009 with the last repayment in December 2009. Approx MUSD 1 has been paid to date under the debt repayment agreement. Remaining payments scheduled for January, February and March amount to approx MUSD 10. Malka Oil is currently in intensive dialogue with the creditors to manage the repayments and avoid legal actions that could potentially block the Company's operations.
Of the outstanding debt to Russian suppliers, approx MUSD 4 is owed to related parties. The discussions with the related parties have been carefully handled by independent board members o f the Company.
In addition, OOO STS-Service has other current liabilities (various supplier debt) of approx MUSD 7 and current assets of approx MUSD 5 (drilling equipment and material).
Failure to raise sufficient capital in the near-term will result in Malka Oil failing to meet its obligations under debt repayment agreement with Russian suppliers which is likely to have adverse impact on the operational activities and could in worst case result in a full stop of on going activities. If that should happen, it is likely that Malka Oil would fail to fulfill its obligations as specified in the license agreement, and could potentially risk loosing the license altogether.
2.3 Liquidity and capital requirement
As at end of December 2008, Malka Oil had a consolidated cash position of MUSD 4 of which approx MUSD 3 was held on accounts owned directly by the parent company (Malka Oil AB), Based on the aforementioned Russian debt restructuring and cost cutting program, in addition to the proposed Financial Restructuring, the Company has identified a capital requirement of approx MUSD 15. The chart below sets out the forecasted monthly cash position under three different scenarios and the assumption that no new capital is raised.

The above projections are based on the following key assumptions: · Average Brent oil price 2009E of approx USD 50 / bbl · Average Brent oil price 2010E of approx USD 65 / bbl · Production assumed sold domestically at an oil price corresponding to 57% of Ural Blend
export price (Ural Blend export price assumed to equal Brent price less USD 3 / bbl) . VAT refund of approx MUSD 6 in 2009E and MUSD 6 in 2010E · Including all operational expenses and Russian debt repayment plan · RUR / USD exchange rate of 30.5

There are of course uncertainties in relation to the key assumptions above. In the event that the oil price does not recover as expected or the domestic oil price discount does not revert to historical levels, it will most likely have a significant adverse impact on Malka Oil which could result in insolvency in the absence of new capital being made available. Furthermore, there is also uncertainty in relation to the VAT refund amount. Partly mitigating the above uncertainties is the potential to further reduce the debt repayment plan to Russian suppliers by up to MUSD 3.

Table below illustrates annual net back in MUSD in relation to production and oil price. The grey shaded area shows combinations where the company would cover its fixed costs (i.e. cash flow positive on a group level) which are estimated to approx MUSD 9 post the cost cutting program. Interest and debt repayments are excluded from the analysis.

The sensitivity analysis above is based on a domestic oil price assumed to equal 57% of Ural Blend export price, all production assumed to be sold domestically via Tomskayaneft and re negotiated selling fee via neighbour reducing selling fee by ~USD 1.0-1.5 / bbl from current level.
Although the sensitivity analysis above is for illustrative purposes only, it suggests that the Company would require a Ural Blend export price of approx USD 55 / bbl to cover all its cash costs assuming a production level of approx 3,000 bpd, At a production level of 4,000 bpd, the corresponding Ural Blend export price would be approx USD 45 / bbl. This analysis assumes a normalised domestic oil price. To the extent the domestic oil price remains at less than 40% of the Ural Blend export price, Malka Oil would require a significantly higher Ural Blend export price to be cash flow break-even.
In the event that the net back from production is negative, as is currently the case, it would obviously make sense to temporarily scale-back or completely shut-down production. The first step, which is already being implemented, is to close down the least productive wells to a degree where an optimum between production revenue and cost is achieved. In step two, the Company would continue to reduce production should markets remain challenging, and the field would then effectively go into hibernation. However, one should note that reducing production is a complex process. Due to the pressure in the wells and temperatures of below minus 40 degrees Celsius during the winter, it is difficult to turn wells on and off. When a well has been closed down it is time consuming, complex and costly to get it back on-stream. Furthermore, Malka Oil must ensure that it complies with the license requirements that stipulate a certain amount of production per year. These production levels could possibly be lowered to some extent, however, that would require a discussion with the authorities and the outcome such discussions is uncertain.
3 PROPOSED FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING
3.1 Overview of the proposed financial restructuring
Malka Oil has engaged Pareto Securities AS (the "Financial Advisor") as financial advisor in relation to the proposed financial restructuring of the Loans (the "Financial Restructuring").
The Financial Restrucuting is proposed to be carried out by a combination of (i) a proposal to the convertible bondholders in the Loans (the "Bondholders") and (ii) a subsequent rights issue of MSEK 140 (the "Rights Issue"). HQ Bank is engaged by the Company as financial advisor in relation to the Rights Issue.
Under the proposal to Bondholders, the Bondholders will be offered to have their convertible bonds converted into new shares in Malka Oil at a ratio of 2,097,500 new shares for each bond with a nominal value of USD 100,000. The ratio corresponds to a subscription price of approx SEK 0,40 per share based on a SEK / USD exchange rate of 8.50. Each new share issued will have a par value of SEK 0.067. The current par value per share is SEK 0.50, however, in conjunction with the Financial Restructuring the share capital per share will be reduced by SEK 0.433. Bondholders will not be eligible to participate in the Rights Issue. Please refer to the "Summon to bondholders 'meeting"forfurther details on theproposal.
The proceeds from the Rights issue are expected to finance the Company's operations going forw ard, primarily the repayments to Russian suppliers under the debt restructuring agreement.

Following the completion of the Financial Restructuring, the share capital of the Borrower will be divided between (i) the Borrower's shareholders prior to the Financial Restructuring; (ii) non existing shareholders participating in the Rights Issue; and (iii) Bondholders converting bonds into new shares.
The table below sets out the proforma ownership prior to the Rights Issue and post the Financial Restructuring assuming that the Rights Issue is fully subscribed on a pro rata basis by existing shareholders.

Proforma ownership structure
Pre Rights Issue Existing shareholders Bondholders Sub-total
Post Financial Restructuring Existing shareholders Bondholders Total

No. of shares held (m)
336 1,678 2,014
2,349 1,678 4,027

Ownership interest
16.7% 83.3% 100.0%
58.3% 43.7% 100.0%

To the extent none of the existing shareholders participate in the Rights Issue, existing shareholders will own 8,3% of the share capital post the Financial Restructuring.

Following a successful completion of the Financial Restructuring, the parent company (Malka Oil AB) will be debt free. On a group level, the debt will consist of the remaining payments to Russian suppliers under the debt restructuring agreement entered into in December 2008.

3.2 Rights Issue
The Rights issue will be carried out as an issue of 6 new shares for each existing share in Malka Oil at a subscription price of SEK 0,07 per share, payable in cash. Each new share issued will have a par value of SEK 0.05. The current par value per share is SEK 0.50, however, in conjunction with the Financial Restructuring the share capital per share will be reduced by SEK 0.433.
The Rights Issue will be conditional upon (i) approval by shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting of Malka Oil (the "EGM") scheduled to take place on 17 March 2009; and (ii) approval by Bondholders at the bondholders' meeting in the Loans in relation to the Financial Restructuring (herunder the relevant proposals), Approval by shareholders at the EGM will require that at least 2/3 of the shares represented at the EGM vote in favour of the resolution.

3.4 Other alternatives explored
The board of directors of Malka Oil have carefully explored various alternatives including raising capital from the public markets on a stand-alone basis and securing reserve based iending, as well as strategic alternatives such as a sale of the Company or a merger.
Given the Company's deteriorating outlook and today's challenging financial markets, it is in the board of directors' opinion not feasible to raise capital in the public market based on Malka Oil's current capital structure. Reserve based lending is an even less viable alternative for the Company in the current environment.
In terms of strategic alternatives, the board of directors of Malka Oil has had several dialogues with various industrial parties over the last 12 months. However, none of these dialogues have materialised into firm negotiations, and there are currently no ongoing discussions in relation to a potential sale of the Company or a merger. Furthermore, the board of directors does not believe it is likely that a potential sale of the Company or a merger will take place during the next 6-12 months.
3.5 Consequences if the Financial Restructuring is not completed
A successful completion of the proposed Financial Restructuring will be critical for Malka Oil to address the liquidity situation and to continue its operations on a going concern basis. In the board of directors' opinion, a failure to complete the Financial Restructuring would severely deteriorate values and diminish any recovery prospects for the Bondholders.
The board of directors have informed the creditors in Russia of the situation and the proposed Financial Restructuring. Given that the Bondholders' acceptance of the Financial Restructuring is likely to be critical to raise new equity capital, the board of directors are of the opinion that a rejection of the proposal by the Bondholders is likely to result in immediate actions by the Russian creditors. Such actions could be debt enforcements via the court system and possible attachment of assets and blocking / arrest of accounts. In the event that debt to Russian creditors is not paid in accordance with the agreed repayment plan, it is not unlikely with a petition for bankruptcy.

In summary, the board of directors of Maika Oil considers the Financial Restructuring as the only viable alternative for the Company to continue on a going concern basis, and also the best alternative for Bondholders to maximise recovery and preserve underlying values.

Background and status

MALKA OIL

 Malka Oil AB ("Malka Oil" or "Malka") adversely impacted by a number of macro factors last 6 months - Global credit crisis - Drop in oil price and verse impact of "lagging" Russian export tax has put pressure on domestic price. In January the Russian domestic oil price was less than 30% of Ural Blend compared to a historical average of 50-55% - Collapse of Russian stock markets and credit crunch in the Russian bank system
 In addition, Malka has not met production expectations and not been able to increase reserves at a satisfactorily pace
 M alka's board and management have addressed these challenges - Debt restructuring completed in Russia and debt repayment plan agreed with major creditors - Extensive cost cutting program currently being implemented
 Board of Malka has identified a capital requirement, excluding interest payments, of ~15 MUSD to fund operations throughout 2009 and to pay off Russian suppliers' debt - Challenging to attract new equity capital in the current environment and with the existing capital structure - Reserve based lending not a viable alternative in today's environment
 Although the board views the situation as critical, they also note that Malka is well positioned to crystallise underlying value post a potential capital raising and debt restructuring - Currently producing 3,000 bpd and targeting 4,000 bpd when all wells are on-stream - Well positioned to further increase production and reserves should overall market conditions improve - infrastructure and necessary permits in place, drilling rigs readily available and in-depth knowledge of reservoir characteristics

Significant potential to increase reserves

 Malka firmly believes that the oil bearing area is significantly larger than the area that has been included in in the isopach maps in the D&M study
 Future field development program expected to uncover significant additional reserves
- Complete testing of well #210 - Complete interpretation of seismic data
 Strategy for increasing reserves include
- Infield drilling starting at drill pad 2 - Small and focused exploration program
 Malka's working theory has been that the two oil fields, LL and ZL, are connected
- Results from exploration wells #580 and #210 supports this theory
