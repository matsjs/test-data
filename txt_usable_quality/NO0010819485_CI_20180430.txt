Point Resources Holding AS Board of Directors' report & Financial Statements 2017

Board of Directors' report 2017

The purpose of Point Resources Holding AS is to invest, own shares and develop companies in which it has an interest. The Company's wholly owned subsidary, Point Resources AS, took in 2017 major steps toward becoming a leading, independent E&P company on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.

Operations and location
Point Resources Holding AS (the "Group", the "Company" or "Point Resources"), located in Grundingen 3, 0250 Oslo, is a limited liability company.
The Company's subsidiary, Point Resources AS, is an independent exploration and production (E&P) company with a diverse portfolio of production, development and exploration assets on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). The head office of its' subsidiary is located in Grenseveien 6, 4313 Sandnes. The annual report of Point Resources AS provides further details on financial and operational aspects of the key assets of the Company.
On 1 November 2017, the subsidiary completed the acquisition of ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Norway AS. The acquisi tion included a transfer of the majority of ExxonMobil's offshore and onshore E&P staff in Norway; a significant package of operated producing assets (Balder, Ringhorne, Ringhorne Øst and Jotun) on the Norwegian Continental Shelf; field assets such as platforms and Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessels (FPSOs); as well as the Company's office building in Sandnes.
Entering 2018, Point Resources has a robust balance sheet with a strong liquidity position and a diversified debt funding mix. The Company follows a conservative and active risk management

policy with hedging and extensive insurance cover to protect downside, and cash flow from the producing fields is expected to enable growth in the coming years.
The Company has identified additional growth potential in the current production portfolio, and it has several projects under development and is actively evaluating M&A and optimisation opportunities. In total, Point Resources targets a production level above 150,000 boepd in the mid of the next decade. The Company has in 2017 taken significant steps towards realising this target.
Going concern
The Board of Directors confirms that the financial statements of the Company have been prepared under the going concern assumption, in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act section 3-3 a.
2017 highlights from the consolidated financial statements

basis for further growth. The corresponding equity ratio year-end 2016 was 36 percent · Revenues increased from USD 94.0 million in 2016 to USD 192.3 million in 2017, the increase is largely attributed to the two months of production from the assets acquired in the ExxonMobil transaction · EBIT ended at USD -31.5 million compared to EBIT of USD -126.4 million in 2016 · Net cash flows from operating activities increased to USD 129.6 million in 2017. The corresponding number for 2016 was USD 71.2 million in 2016 · Net cash used in investing activities in 2017 increased to USD 747.1 million, up from 11.1 million in 2016 · Net cash from financing activities increased to USD 791.5 million in 2017, up from USD -9.0 million in 2016

Company does not apply hedge accounting in 2017. For further detail refer to note 5.1 in the financial statements.
The working environment and the employees
The Group's Board of Directors consists of two men and one woman.
The Group's employees are hired in the Group's subsidiary, Point Resources AS. As of 31 December 2017, the Company had 354 permanent employees, whereof female employees accounted for 21 percent, and nine nationalities were represented.
The sick leave rate is subject to monitoring and follow-up. The sick leave rate in the Groups subsidiary, Point Resources was 1.9 percent for 2017, which is considered low. The subsidiary seeks to have a good gender balance and to be an equal opportunity employer. Recruitment of personnel is based on ability without reference to any personal characteristic.

The Company has changed presentation currency from NOK to USD, and it has been applied for comparative periods in the financial statements.
· The parent company has a cash position of USD 159.6 million at year end, compared to USD 32.0 million in 2016
· The equity ratio of the parent company was 98 percent year-end 2017 compared to 99 percent year-end 2016
· The parent company had no revenues in 2017 and 2016 · EBIT ended at USD -0.09 million compared to EBIT of USD -0.01
million in 2016 · Net financial items amounted to USD 16.1 million in 2017. The
corresponding number for 2016 was USD 1.5 million · Net cash flows from operating activities amounted to USD -0.4
million in 2017.

The parent company's profit for the year for 2017 was USD 12.3 million. The Board proposes that the profit for the year is trans ferred to other equity.
Financial risk
The financial results are dependent on several factors, of which fluctuations in commodity prices and the NOK/USD exchange rates are the most significant. As experienced in 2017, shifting commodity prices and foreign exchange rates can have significant impact on financial results. Revenues are mainly denominated in USD, while a significant amount of operating expenses and income taxes largely are nominated in NOK. Revenues are directly affected by the oil price and the Company has partly mitigated this risk by entering into hedge structures related to the oil price. Derivatives are categorised as held for trading in the financial statement as the

To monitor and coordinate initiatives and ensure alignment with rele vant laws and regulations, a central work environment committee has been established for the Group's subsidiary, along with additional work environment subcommittees for all onshore and offshore locations.
External environment
The Group is exposed to a variety of operational risks. The Group is committed to creating a safe and healthy work environment for employees in the Group's subsidiary and to minimise the environ mental and social impact of its business. The Board of Director is pleased to report no serious injuries, no actual or potential high consequence incidents in the Group's operations in 2017.
Efforts to create a Corporate Social Responsibility program has commenced. A dedicated program for sponsorships, contributions and similar initiatives was not part of the Company's business in 2017 but will be operational in 2018 and accounted for in next year's annual report.
Subsequent events
In January 2018, the Company was awarded ten new licences in the APA 2017 licensing round. In two of the licences Point Resources was appointed operatorship. On 2 March 2018, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate announced an oil discovery in the Frosk well (PL 340). Preliminary estimates indicate that the size of the discovery is between 5 and 10 million standard cubic metres (Sm3) of recoverable oil. Point Resources has a 20 percent participating interest in the Frosk prospect. On 13 March 2018, Point Resources successfully completed a senior unsecured bond issue of USD 250 million, with maturity in September 2024. On 5 April 2018, the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy approved the Plan for Development and Operation (PDO) of the Fenja field (PL 586) in the Norwegian Sea. The Company has a 45 percent ownership interest in the field.

Section 1 Background information

1.1. Corporate information

The consolidated financial statements of Point Resources Holding AS and its subsidiaries (collectively, "the Group", "the Company" or "Point Resources") for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue in accordance with a Board resolution on 27 April 2018. Point Resources Holding AS is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Norway and the Company's shares are privately held. The Group's head office is located at Grundingen 3, 0250 Oslo, Norway.
Point Resources is a mid-sized, independent exploration and production (E&P) company with a diverse portfolio of production, development and exploration assets on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS).

On 1 November 2017, Point Resources AS acquired ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Norway AS. The acquisition included a transfer of the majority of ExxonMobil's offshore and onshore E&P staff in Norway; a significant package of operated producing assets on the Norwegian Continental Shelf; field assets such as platforms and Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessels (FPSOs); as well as the Company's office building in Sandnes.

Accounting policy - Basis of consolidation Control is deemed to exist when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consol idated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.

Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income ("OCI") are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

1.2 Basis for preparation

The Group's financial statements consist of consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of financial position, consolidated statements of cash flow, consol idated statements of changes in equity, and related notes. The con solidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by The European Union (EU).

the period prior to contribution in kind. Valuation and recognition have been carried out in accordance with current IFRS standards.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value. Further, the financial statements are prepared based on the going concern assumption.

Point Resources Holding AS ("PRH") was acquired by Pure E&P AS ("Pure") and Spike Exploration AS ("Spike") as a shelf company from Bahr. At 23 May 2016, the Company had NOK 30 thousand in equity, and through a series of transactions the Company became the ultimate owner of Point Resources AS ("PRAS"). The first transaction was a capital reduction where the NOK 30 thousand in equity was repaid to the owners, which subsequently was followed up by a capital increase (contribution in kind), where Pure, Spike and Core Energy Holding AS ("Core") contributed its shares in PRAS against consideration shares in PRH.
The transaction was not considered to be a business combination and the pooling of interest method was applied. As a consequence of this historical figures from PRAS are recorded at continuity in the consolidated financial statement as if the Company had owned PRAS from January 1, 2016. Historical financial information is pre pared using the same presentation and accounting principles for

The consolidated financial statements are presented in USD and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (000) except when otherwise indicated. The parent Company's functional currency is NOK. The Group has chosen to present its financial statements in USD, as this a commonly used presentation currency among oil and gas companies.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group's entities at their respective functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. For presentation purposes, balance sheet items are translated from functional currency to presentation currency by using spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Items within total comprehensive income are translated from functional currency to presentation currency by use of average exchange rates for each month.

1.3. General accounting principles

Significant accounting judgements, estim ates and assumptions The preparation of the Group's financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, the accompanying disclosures and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affecting future periods. The Group bases its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements are

prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions as they occur.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimating uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are listed below and are also discussed in the individual notes of the related financial statement line items.

Current versus non-current classification The Group presents assets and liabilities in the statements of financial position based on a current/non-current classification. An asset is current when it is:
· Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle
· Held primarily for the purpose of trading

· Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period
· Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period
All other assets are classified as non-current.

14

Point Resources Holding AS Board of Directors' report & Financial Statements 2017

A liability is current when: · It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle · It is held primarily for the purpose of trading · It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting
period · There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the
liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.

Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construc tion or production of a qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. Borrowing costs are only capitalized during the development phase. Qualifying assets are generally those that are subject to major development or construction projects. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

1.4. Changes in accounting principles and disclosures

Recognition of revenue from production of oil and gas In conjunction with the business combination, the Group re-as sessed its accounting principle for recognition of revenue from production of oil and gas. The Group previously recognised all rev enues based on its net working interest (the entitlement method). Lifting imbalances, which represents the difference between lifted volumes and the Group's share of produced volumes, was presented as current assets or current liabilities. Such assets and liabilities were initially recognised and subsequently measured at net realisable value.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group decided to change the method of accounting for revenues from production of oil and gas in which the Group has an interest to align Point Resources and the acquired business from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Norway AS. In addition, current standards do not regulate lifting imbalances, and in practice, entities use either the

sales method or the entitlements method. Under the new standard for recognition of revenue, IFRS 15, the entitlement method is not expected to be in scope as revenue as determined under IFRS 15 only can arise from transactions with customers, and the overlifter will probably not be considered as a customer.
As of 2017 the Group has recognised revenue based on the actual lifted amount of production (sales method) and will record a lifting imbalance when actual sales/lifted amount differ from the share of production. Such assets and liabilities are initially recognised and subsequently measured to production cost. If the market price is lower than production cost an underlift asset would be measured to current market value.
The effect of changing accounting policy to the sales method has been analysed and summarized in the table below:

USD 1 000 1 JANUARY 2016
Equity Tax liability Underlift (asset)

159 (understated) 579 (understated) 738 (understated)

1 JANUARY 2017
Equity Tax liability Overlift (liability)

196 (understated) 717 (understated) 913 (overstated)

The total effect for comparative periods is considered to be immate rial for the financial statement and the change in accounting policies has not been applied retrospectively for comparative periods.
For more details on the revenue recognition accounting policy, refer to note 2.3.
New and amended standards and interpretations The Group applied for the first time certain amendments to the IFRSs, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. The Group has not early adopted any standards,

interpretations or amendments that have been issued, but are not yet effective. The nature and the impact of each amendment is described below:
A m endm ents to IAS 7 Statem ent of Cash Flows: Disclosure Initiative The amendments require entities to provide disclosure of changes in their liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes (such as foreign exchange gains or losses). The Group has provided the information for the current period in note 5.6.

1.5. Standards and amendments issued but not yet effective

The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group's financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective.

In addition, the Group has to prepare additional disclosure information as required.
Below are the new standards described in more detail:

The IASB has issued three new standards that are particularly relevant for the Group, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases.
Based on its current sales contracts and a to a limited extent financial instruments, the Group does not expect significant effects from IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 with respect to recognition and meas urement. The Group does however expect to prepare additional disclosures on revenue from contracts with customers and financial instruments when the standards become effective. The Group may choose to implement hedge accounting when adopting IFRS 9, however, the effects of such a change will rather be a result of new application of accounting principles than an isolated effect from IFRS 9, as the Group has not chosen to implement hedge accounting under current IFRS regime (IAS 39).
The Group has assessed the revenue recognition accounting policy in 2017 and changed from the entitlement method to the sales method, see note 1.4.
The effects from implementing IFRS 16 will be assessed during 2018. The Company expects that it will have to recognise several leases on their balance sheet that will result in:
· Annual lease expenses recognised as operational expenses under IAS 17 will impact the EBITDA positively
· Annual depreciation of leased assets will increase and affect EBITDA positively.

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. Except for hedge accounting, retrospective application is required, but providing comparative information is not compul sory. For hedge accounting, the requirements are generally applied prospectively, with some limited exceptions.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date. During 2016 and 2017, the Group performed a highlevel impact assessment of IFRS 9. This preliminary assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject to changes arising from further detailed analyses or additional rea sonable and supportable information being made available to Point Resources in the future. Overall, the Group expects no significant impact of IFRS 9, except from different disclosures being required.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.

Section 2 Operating performance

2.1. Business combinations

Accounting policy - Business combinations A business combination is as a transaction or other event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. A business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs. Determining whether a particular set of assets and activities is a business should be based on whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted and managed as a business by a market participant.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as consideration transferred representing acquisition date fair value. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the consideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed).
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irre spective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Acquisition of ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway On 1 November, 2017, the Group acquired ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Norway AS. The acquisition included a transfer of the majority of ExxonMobil's offshore and onshore E&P staff in Norway; a significant package of operated producing assets

(Balder, Ringhorne, Ringhorne Øst and Jotun) on the Norwegian Continental Shelf; field assets such as platforms and Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessels (FPSOs); as well as the Company's office building in Sandnes.
The business was acquired by and combined with Point Resources AS to create a strong, new mid-sized Norwegian E&P company. With an asset portfolio that includes several fields in the develop ment phase, the combined Company has the potential to grow its production base organically to over 90 000 boepd by 2022, and has proven and probable reserves and contingent resources of about 369 million barrels of oil equivalent at year-end 2017.
As part of the transaction the Group acquired 100 percent of the shares in in Standard Marine Nordsjø AS and in ExxonMobil Property Norway (2) AS. In addition, the Group acquired the remaining 5 percent of the interest in PR Jotun DA.
Standard Marine Nordsjø AS later changed name to Point Resources FPSO AS. Shares in Point Resources FSPO AS and PR Jotun DA were incorporated in the new company Point Resources FPSO Holding AS.
The shares in ExxonMobil Property Norway (2) AS (later changed name to Grenseveien 6 AS) were sold to ABP Holdco AS immedi ately after the acquisition and the Group entered a lease agree ment with the new owner. For more information on the transaction see note 4.3 and 4.4.
The transaction with ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Norway AS is recorded as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3. The acquisition date for accounting purposes corre sponds to the completion date of the transaction on 1 November 2017. For tax and economic purposes, the effective date was 1 January 2017.

Deferred payments A part of the purchase price is to be paid over four instalments (2018 - 2020) and another part is due in 2020. All outstanding payments are subject to interest.
Contingent consideration As part of the purchase agreement with the previous owner, the following contingent considerations have been agreed:
a) An annual contingent consideration the following 5 years if the yearly average oil price exceeds a certain threshold. The maximum contingent consideration each year is USD 25 million. As at the acquisition date, the fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated with option pricing methodology to USD 22.9 million.

b) A fixed amount and an additional amount per barrel of oil equivalent, that exceeds a threshold of oil equivalents, if the Group utilize their option to develop the Forseti structure. As at the acquisition date, the fair value of the contingent considera tion was estimated with a DCF method to USD 33.7 million.

According to § 10 in the Norwegian Petroleum Tax Act transaction shall be done after tax and the buyer is therefore not entitled to claim tax deduction for the part of consideration that exceeds the tax position acquired from the seller. Provision for deferred tax is made for the difference between acquisition cost and acquired tax base in accordance with IAS 12. Offsetting entry of this non-cash deferred tax is technical goodwill.
The remaining goodwill of USD 80.6 million comprises the value of expected synergies arising from the acquisition and assembled workforce, which is not separately recognised. Goodwill is allocated entirely to operations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS).

None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The valuation is based on currently available information on fair values as of the acquisition date. If new information becomes available within 12 months from the acquisition date, the Group may change the fair value assessment in the purchase price allocation, in accordance with guidance in IFRS 3. Any adjustments will result in a corresponding adjustment of goodwill.

NET CASH FLOW FROM ACQUISITION
Net cash acquired Cash paid Net cash flow on acquisition

36 594 672 136 -635 541

From the date of acquisition, ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway has contributed USD 131 million of revenue and USD 49 million to the net profit before tax. If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, revenue would have been USD 812 million and the profit before tax for the period would have been USD 119 million.

2.2. Segment information

Accounting policy - Segment information Since the establishment of Point Resources in May 2016, its operations have been fully focused on exploration and production of petroleum on NCS, which is also the level used by executive management in monitoring the operating results for the purpose of making decisions.
The Group's activities are considered to have a homogeneous risk and return profile (same geographical area and activities). Hence, all of Point Resources' activities are focused within one single

operation segment (NCS). Segment figures are therefore similar to the income statements.
Significant customers In 2017 and 2016 revenues from sale of oil and gas to ExxonMobil, Statoil and Shell each amounted to more than 10 percent of total revenues. Total revenues from those customers were USD 131,6 million, USD 35,3 million (2016: USD 42,7 million) and USD 21,0 million (2016: USD 51,8 million) respectively.

2.3. Revenues and other income

Accounting policy - Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is received. Point Resources has concluded that it is the principal in all of its revenue arrangements since it is the primary obligor in all the revenue arrangements, has pricing latitude, and is also exposed to over- and underlift and credit risks.
Revenues from production of oil and gas Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods pro vided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs duties and sales taxes.
Revenues from production of oil and gas in which the Group has an interest is recognised based on the Group's actual lifted amount of production (the sales method). The Group records an overlift

liability when actual sales/lifted amount exceeds the Group's share of actual production in the period. Similarly, the Group would record an underlift asset when share of production exceeds actual lifted volumes. The over- or underlift is adjusted to production costs.
Lifting imbalances are initially recognised and subsequently measured to production costs. If the market price is lower than production cost, an underlift asset would be measured to current market value if the lifting imbalance will be settled by future lifting. Imbalances which are expected to be settled in cash are to be measured at net realisable value.
The Group has changed accounting principle for recognising revenues from production of oil and gas from assets in which the Group has an interest, from the Group's net working interest (the entitlement method) to the sales method for the year ended 31 December 2017. See more information in note 1.4.

2.4. Production cost/inventory

Accounting policy - Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by the first-in first-out method and comprises direct purchase costs, cost of production and tariffs and transportation. Net realisable value is determined by reference to prices existing at the balance sheet date less selling costs. Net realisable value is adjusted where the sale of inventories after the reporting period gives evidence about their net realisable value at the end of the period.

Section 3 Asset base

3.1. Exploration and evaluation assets

Accounting policy - Exploration, evaluation and development expenditure Exploration, evaluation and development expenditures are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
(i) Pre-licence costs Pre-licence costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
(ii) Licence and property acquisition costs Exploration licence and property acquisition costs are capitalised as intangible assets. Licence costs paid in connection with a right to explore in an existing exploration area are capitalised in intangible assets.
Licence and acquisition costs are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there are no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under way or firmly planned, or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine that the discovery is economically viable based on a range of technical and commercial considerations and that sufficient progress is being made on establishing development plans and timing.

When exploration efforts lead to commercial discoveries and inter nal approval for development is sanctioned, the relevant expenditure is transferred to oil and gas properties. If no future activity is planned or the licence has been relinquished or has expired, the carrying value of the licence and property acquisition costs are written off through the statement of comprehensive income.
(iii) Exploration and evaluation costs Exploration and evaluation activity involves the search for hydro carbon resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource.
Once the legal right to explore has been acquired, costs directly associated with an exploration well are capitalised as exploration and evaluation intangible assets until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated. These costs include directly attributable employee remuneration, materials and fuel used, rig costs and payments made to contractors.
Geological and geophysical costs are expensed as exploration costs through the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.

There was no significant reclassification to the statement of comprehensive income during 2017.
If no potentially commercial hydrocarbons are discovered, the exploration asset is written off through the statements of com prehensive income as a dry hole. If extractable hydrocarbons are found and are subject to further appraisal activity (e.g., the drilling of additional wells), it is probable that they can be commercially developed, and the costs are capitalised. The costs continue to be carried as an intangible asset while sufficient/continued progress is made in assessing the commerciality of the hydrocarbons. Costs directly associated with appraisal activity undertaken to determine the size, characteristics and commercial potential of a reservoir following the initial discovery of hydrocarbons, including the costs of appraisal wells where hydrocarbons were not found, are initially capitalised as an intangible asset.
All such capitalised costs are subject to technical, commercial and management review, as well as review for indicators of impairment at least once a year. This is to confirm the continued intent to develop or otherwise extract value from the discovery. When this is no longer the case, the costs are written off through the statement of comprehensive income .
When proved reserves of oil are determined and development is sanctioned by management, the relevant capitalised expenditure is first assessed for impairment and (if required) any impairment

loss is recognised, then the remaining balance is transferred to oil and gas properties. Other than for licence costs, no amortisation is charged during the exploration and evaluation phase.
For exchanges/swaps or parts of exchanges/swaps that involve only exploration and evaluation assets, the exchange is accounted for at the carrying value of the asset given up and no gain or loss is recognised.
(iv) Farm-outs -- in the exploration and evaluation phase The Group does not record any expenditure made by the farmee on its account. It neither recognise any gain or loss on its exploration and evaluation farm-out arrangements, but re-designates any costs previously capitalised in relation to the whole interest as relating to the partial interest retained. Any cash consideration received directly from the farmee is credited against costs previously capi talised in relation to the whole interest with any excess accounted for by the farmor as a gain on disposal.
(v) Development costs Expenditures on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of development wells, including unsuccessful development or delineation wells, are capitalised within oil and gas properties.

24

Point Resources Holding AS Board of Directors' report & Financial Statements 2017

Significant judgements, estimates and assumptions The application of the Group's accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgement to determine whether future economic benefits are likely, from either future exploitation or sale, or whether activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves. The determination of reserves and resources is itself an estimation process that involves varying degrees of uncertainty depending on how the resources are classified. These estimates directly impact when the Group defers exploration and evaluation

expenditure. The deferral policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions about future events and circumstances, in particular, whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after expenditure is capitalised, information becomes available suggesting that the recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalised amount is written off in the statement of comprehensive income in the period when the new information becomes available.

3.2. Oil and gas properties

Accounting policy - Oil and gas properties (i) Initial recognition Oil and gas properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation, the initial estimate of the decommissioning obligation and, for qualifying assets (where relevant), borrowing costs. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. The capitalised value of a finance lease is also included within property, plant and equipment.
When a development project moves into the production phase, the capitalisation of certain construction/ development costs ceases, and costs are either regarded as part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for costs which qualify for capitalisation relating to oil and gas property asset additions, improvements or new developments.
(ii) Depreciation/amortisation Oil and gas properties are depreciated/amortised on a unit-of-production basis over the total proved developed, proved undeveloped

and probable reserves expected to be recovered from the relevant fields. The depletion rate takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with estimated future capital expenditures.
The estimated reserves, asset's residual values and methods of depreciation/amortisation are reviewed annually and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
Jotun FPSO A is depreciated over the lease period which ends 30 June 2020.
(iii) Major maintenance, inspection and repairs Where an asset, or part of an asset that was separately depreci ated and is now written off is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group, the expenditure is capitalised. Inspection costs associated with major maintenance programmes are capitalised and amortised over the period to the next inspection. All other day-to-day repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Accounting policy - Im pairm ent losses (non-financial assets excluding goodwill) The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset or Cash Generating Unit (CGU) may be impaired. Management has assessed its CGU's as being an individual field, which is the lowest level for which cash inflows are largely independent of those of other assets. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and value-in use (VIU). The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, in which case the asset is tested as part of a larger CGU to which it belongs. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset/CGU is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

In calculating VIU, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset/CGU. The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts, which are prepared separately for each of the Group's CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.
Impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment of inventories, are recognised in the statements of comprehensive income.
For assets/CGUs excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's/CGU's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that

26

Point Resources Holding AS Board of Directors' report & Financial Statements 2017

the carrying amount of the asset/CGU does not exceed either its recoverable amount, or the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation/amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset/CGU in prior years. Such a reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Estimates and assumptions The useful life of each asset, which is assessed at least annually, has both physical life limitations and present assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the field at which the asset is located. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including the amount of recoverable reserves, decommissioning costs, discount rate, exchange rates and estimates of future capital expenditure.
Future estimated cash flow for assets or CGU's Changes in expected cash flow associated with asset or Cash Generating Unit (CGU) may result in an impairment of the carrying amount of individual assets to estimated recoverable value. Impairment assessments require long-term assumptions regarding economic factors, oil price, the Group's long-term oil price assumptions, oil production, exchange rates, discount rates, cost estimates (capex and opex) and residual value of assets.
Total proved developed, proved undeveloped and probable reserves Annual estimates of oil and gas reserves and resources are generated internally by the Group's reservoir engineers. Standard recognised evaluation techniques are used to estimate the proved and probable reserves and the contingent resources based on quantities of crude oil, natural gas and economic and operational conditions. The estimates are based on prices from today's market, with the exception of already contractual price changes. Changes in proved developed, proved undeveloped and probable reserves could arise due to changes in the factors or assumptions used in estimating reserves, including commodity prices and future capital expenditure. An independent reserves auditor reviews the reserve estimates annually and results are reported to the Board along with an externally generated Reserves Audit Report.
Changes in future oil prices and future capital expenditure estimates can change reserves estimates, and hence the time when fields become unprofitable, which affects the time of shutdown and decommissioning activities. For more information on decommissioning cost see note 4.2.

Unit-of-production rate of depreciation/amortisation The calculation of the unit-of-production rate of depreciation/ amortisation will be impacted by revision of proven and probable reserves and future capital expenditure estimate changes.
Discount rate The Group's discount rate is derived from the Group's post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both the cost of debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group's investors. The cost of debt is based on interest-bearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service. Segment specific risk is incor porated by applying individual beta factors. The beta factors are evaluated annually based on publicly available market data.
Cost profiles Cost profiles used in the calculation of value in use are based on operator budgets and general market assessments done by the Group's facility and operations engineers. Cost profiles consists of operating expenses and capital expenditures. Operating expenses comprises variable elements such as processing tariffs, pipeline tariffs, and lease rates and fixed elements such as platform costs and operator overheads. Capital expenditures can relate to investments made to develop a field, or to already producing fields to maintain/ increase production or prolong the field life.
Im p airm en ts The Group has not recognised any impairments of oil and gas properties in 2016 or 2017.
Value in use is calculated by discounting future cash flows after tax. Below is an overview of key assumptions used in the impair ment tests as at 31 December 2017.
Economic assumptions The Group uses available market information to regularly assess the short- and long-term outlook for commodity prices. Assumptions regarding commodity prices are continually reviewed and updated by management. According to the above method ology the Group has used the following future quality adjusted oil prices and forward exchange rates in the calculation of the recoverable amount for oil and gas properties.

3.4. Goodwill and other intangible assets

Accounting policy - Other intangible assets and goodwill Goodwill Goodwill arises principally because of the following factors:
· The ability to capture unique synergies that can be realised from managing a portfolio of both acquired and existing fields
· The requirement to recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities for the difference between the assigned values and the tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at amounts that do not reflect fair value (more information in note 2.1)

Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recog nition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets with definite lives are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation (generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives) and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Indefinite lived intangibles are not amortised, instead they are tested for impairment at least annually. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs and E&E assets, are not capitalised. Instead, the

Point Resources Holding AS Board of Directors' report & Financial Statements 2017

related expenditure is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
In relation to the acquisition of ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway, seismic and other technical data of USD 34.9 million was capitalized as other intangible assets. Seismic data was related to the Balder, Ringhorne and Forseti fields. If the Group's busi ness activity in the area ceases, the seismic is impaired immediately.

There are no intangible assets with indefinite lives in the Group.

Impairment testing of goodwill For impairment testing purposes, all acquired goodwill has been allocated to the Group's assets on the NCS.
Accounting policy - Impairm ent losses goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Impairment is deter mined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or group of CGU's to which the good will relates. Where the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount of the asset including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. For more information on accounting policies, estimates and assumptions see note 3.2.
When assessing impairment of technical goodwill, recognised deferred tax related to a business combination (see more infor mation in note 2.1) will reduce net book value before impairment assessment. Going forward depreciation of excess values from the acquisition analysis will lead to a reduction in deferred tax liability, hence more technical goodwill will be exposed to impairment.

Impairm ent testing ordinary goodwill Goodwill of USD 95.7 million has been allocated to the Group's operations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). The recov erable amount of the CGU has been determined based on a value in use calculation as described above and outlined in note 3.2. As a result of the analysis, no impairment was required for this CGU.
Impairm ent testing technical goodwill Technical goodwill of USD 467 million is related to the Group's acquisition of ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Norway AS that was completed 1 November 2017 and is allocated to the Groups operations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). The recoverable amount of CGU has been determined based on a value in use calculation as described above and outlined in note 3.2. As a result of the analysis, no impairment was required for this CGU.

Section 4 Special items and provisions

4.1. Provisions for other liabilities

Accounting policy - Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the statement of comprehensive income net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as part of finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income.

Other provisions Other provisions comprise provision on a total of USD 12 million where USD 9 million is payable 1 January 2019 and USD 3 million is payable 1 January 2020. The provision relates to decommis sioning costs on the Athena field in connection with former Spike Exploration AS' sale of Spike UK to Verus Petroleum Holding Limited.
Deferred payments Related to the contingent Forseti consideration from the acquisi tion of ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Norway AS, see note 2.1 and 4.3 for more information.

4.2. Decommissioning provision

Accounting policy - Provisions Equivalent to provisions for other liabilities, see note 4.1.
Accounting policy - Decommissioning provision The obligation generally arises when the asset is installed, or the ground/environment is altered at the field location. When the liability is initially recognised, the present value of the estimated costs is capitalised by increasing the carrying amount of the related oil and gas assets.
Changes in the estimated timing or cost of decommissioning are dealt with prospectively by recording an adjustment to the provision and a corresponding adjustment to oil and gas assets.
Any reduction in the decommissioning liability and, therefore, any deduction from the asset to which it relates, may not exceed the carry ing amount of that asset. If it does, any excess over the carrying value is taken immediately to the statement of comprehensive income.
If the change in an estimate results in an increase in the decom missioning liability and, therefore, an addition to the carrying value

of the asset, the Group considers whether this is an indication of impairment of the asset as a whole, and if so, tests for impairment. If, for mature fields, the estimate for the revised value of oil and gas assets net of decommissioning provisions exceeds the recoverable value, that portion of the increase is charged directly to expense.
Over time, the discounted liability is increased for the change in present value based on the discount rate that reflects current market assessments and the risks specific to the liability. The periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a finance cost.
Decommissioning provision The Group makes full provision for the future cost of decom missioning oil production facilities on a discounted basis on the installation of those facilities. The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to oil and gas properties, which are expected to be incurred up to 2030 - 2040 which is when the producing oil and gas properties are expected to cease operations.

Estimates and assumptions The Group assesses its decommissioning provision at each reporting date. The ultimate decommissioning costs are uncertain and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors, including changes to relevant legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques or experience at other production sites. The expected timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates. This, in turn, will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain. The same assumptions as described in note

3.2 are valid for decommissioning provision in addition to changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation.
The discount rate used in the calculation of the provision as at 31 December 2017 is equal to estimated future U.S. government bond rates and standard premium.
Therefore, significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for decommissioning. As a result, there could be significant adjustments to the provisions established

32

Point Resources Holding AS Board of Directors' report & Financial Statements 2017

which would affect future financial results. The provision at reporting date represents management's best estimate of the present value of the future decommissioning costs required.
Compensation of decommissioning costs for Jotun As part of the transaction with ExxonMobil in 2017, the seller has in the sale and purchase agreement agreed to pay parts of the

decommissioning costs for Jotun and the Group has recorded a receivable against ExxonMobil to cover those costs that are within compensation threshold. The Group expects that all decommis sioning costs within the compensation threshold will be refunded from the seller.

4.3. Commitments and contingencies

Accounting policy - Capital commitments and other contingencies (i) Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset (or assets), even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.

liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.

Group as a lessee Operating lease payments are recognised as an operating expense in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease

Operating lease comm itm ents - Group as lessee The Group has entered into operating leases for buildings, and various items of plant and machinery. These leases have an average life of two years (2016: three years), with renewal terms at the option of the lessee whereby the Group can extend at lease terms based on market prices at the time of renewal. There are no restrictions placed upon the Group as a result of entering into these leases. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December explained in the table below.

Other contractual obligations
Minimum work programs The Group is required to participate in the approved work programs for the licences.
Liability for damages/insurance The Group's operations involve risk for damages, including pollution. Installations and operations are covered by an operations insurance policy.
Guarantees The Group has provided guarantees with USD 0.35 million in favour of Hess Norge AS and USD 0.03 million in favour of Gassco.
Other obligations Related to the decommissioning of Jotun B, there is a cancellation fee of USD 2.2 million in the contract with Heerema. The Group is committed to CHC Helikopter Service AS for 12 months with a standing charge of USD 6.45 million.
Contingencies As part of the acquisition of ExxonMobil's operated upstream busi ness in Norway, the Group has agreed to pay the seller an annual contingent consideration the following 5 years (2017 - 2021) if the yearly average oil price exceeds a certain threshold. As at 31 December 2017, the fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated with option pricing methodology to be USD 22.9 million.
The Group also has to pay a fixed amount and an additional amount per barrel of oil equivalent, that exceeds a threshold of oil equiva lents, if the Group utilize their option to develop the Forseti structure. As at 31 December 2017, the fair value of the contingent considera tion was estimated with a DCF method to USD 33.7 million.

some of the historic tax filings for Pure E&P Norway AS. Ongoing cases where the tax authorities have issued such notifications of disagreement involve a maximum possible tax exposure for Point Resources Holding AS of approximately NOK 20m.
Future deposit requirements As part of the Sale and Purchase Agreement(SPA) with ExxonMobil, the Group shall deposit to the seller a post-tax amount of USD 127 million 1 January 2022. According to the Norwegian Petroleum Act Section 5-3(3) ExxonMobil is secondarily financially responsible for the asset retirement obligation related to interest in the oil fields acquired by the Group. ExxonMobil is in accordance with the SPA required to repay (without any delay) Point Resources the entire deposit in an event where the sellers liability do not materialize (i.e. Point Resources fulfils the assets retirement commitments for the acquired licences according to plan).
The Post Completion Payment does not satisfy the definition of a liability under IFRS as the future payment is not an obligation at the acquisition date from past events for Point Resources. The deposit is considered only to be a part of the agreement due to the requirements in the Petroleum Act Section 5-3(3) and not part of the pricing and valuation of the transaction between the parties. The Post Completion Payment is not expected to materialize and Point Resources' obligation is already indirectly included under the ARO liability related to the acquired licences at fair value in accordance with IFRS 3.
As the Post Completion Payment does not satisfy the definition of a liability and is not considered to be a part of the transaction, the liability should not be recorded as part of the purchase price allo cation based on the general principles in IFRS 3. The recognition criteria under IAS 37 are not fulfilled either, but will be continuously assessed at future reporting periods.

Point Resources Holding AS has an obligation to hold Pure E&P AS (previously Rocksource ASA) harmless from any claim against it resulting from alleged obligations under a farm-out agreement entered into with ONGC in relation to a block offshore India. Relating to this, ONGC has issued cash calls for the drilling of 3 dry wells, amounting to USD 20.3m (excluding any interest), which Pure E&P AS considers it is not obliged to and has consequently refused to pay. ONGC is pursuing its claim through arbitration proceedings in India.

Significant judgements, estim ates and assumptions Contingent liabilities may arise from the ordinary course of business in relation to claims against the Group, including legal, contractor, land access and other claims. By their nature, contin gencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence, and potential quantum, of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events.

Based on certain historic events involving Pure E&P Norway AS (previously Rocksource Exploration Norway AS) (one of the compa nies involved in the merger creating Point Resources AS), the Oil Taxation Office has issued notifications of disagreement with

4.4. Deferred revenue

Accounting policy - Sale-and-leaseback transaction When a sale-and-leaseback transaction results in a finance lease, any excess of sales proceeds over the carrying amount should not be recognised immediately as income by a seller/lessee. Instead, the excess is deferred and amortized over the lease term.

After the Group sold the shares in ExxonMobil Property Norway (2) AS, the Group immediately entered into a finance lease for the office building located in Grenseveien 6, 4313 Sandnes. The excess of sales proceeds is deferred and amortized over the lease term (20 years).

Section 5 Financial instruments, capital structure and equity

5.1. Financial instruments

Accounting policy - Financial instruments Classification of financial instruments The Group's financial instruments are classified in the following categories:
· fair value with changes in value through profit or loss (FVPL) · loans and receivables · other financial liabilities
Derivatives are classified as FVPL financial instruments as the Group does not apply hedge accounting. Thus, the FVPL instru ments as held for trading from an accounting perspective.

Initial recognition and subsequent measurement FVPL: Financial derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are categorized as held for trading and initially measured at their fair value. Subsequent changes in the fair value are recognised in income statements. The Group has entered into Brent crude oil put options and the changes in fair value is presented as other income.
Fair value of unlisted shares is estimated by using standard valuation techniques or is measured at cost if the investment does not have a quoted market price in an active market and the fair value cannot be reliably measured.

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable cash flows that are not quoted in an active market. Other financial liabilities are generally the main category for loans and borrowings.

Loans and receivables and Other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction expenses. Subsequently, these instruments are measured at their amortized cost.

Point Resources Holding AS Board of Directors' report & Financial Statements 2017

Impairment of financial assets Financial assets valued at amortized cost are impaired when objective evidence exists that the instrument's cash flows have been negatively affected by one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the instrument. The impairment loss is recognised in the income statements. The loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted with the instruments original effective interest rate. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases because

of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is increased or reduced.
De-recognition of financial instruments A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.

5.2. Financial risk management

Overview The Group is exposed to a range of risks affecting its financial performance, including market risk (commodity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. The Group seeks to minimize potential adverse effects of such risks through sound business practices, risk management and use of derivative financial instruments.
Risk management is carried out by senior management under policies approved by the Board. All derivative activities for risk man agement purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. It is the Group's policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes may be undertaken. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
(a) Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Financial

instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, accrued liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the position as at 31 December 2017 and 2016.
Commodity price risk Point Resources is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in prevailing market commodity prices on the oil products it produces. The Group's policy is to manage these risks through the use of derivative commodity contracts (Brent crude oil put options).
Commodity price sensitivity The table below summarises the impact on profit before tax for changes in commodity prices on the fair value of derivative financial instruments. The impact on equity is the same as the impact on profit after tax as these derivative financial instruments have not been designated as hedges and are classified as held-fortrading and therefore fair valued through the income statements.

Point Resources Holding AS Board of Directors' report & Financial Statements 2017

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible increase or decrease in the oil price, holding all other variables constant:

+/- 10 % +/- 10 %

+/- 9 404 +/- 19 232

EFFECT ON EQUITY
(USD 1 000)
+/- 2 069 +/- 4 231

Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group's reserve based lending with floating interest rate. As of 31 December 2017, the Group does not have any interest hedging instruments nor any fixed rate loan agreements.

Interest rate sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Group's profit before tax:

31 December 2016 31 December 2017

INCREASE/ DECREASE IN BASIS POINTS

+/- 100 +/- 100

+/- 2 706 +/- 4 803

EFFECT ON EQUITY
(USD 1 000)
+/- 1 597 +/- 2 593

Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group is exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to the value of NOK (functional currency) relative to other currencies, mainly due to sales in USD and operational costs in NOK, USD, GBP and EUR. The Group has also currency risk related to long term credit facility in USD. The Group may seek to reduce the currency risk by entering into foreign currency instruments. The Group does not have any currency hedging

instruments as of 31 December 2017, however management is monitoring movements in exchange rates closely.
Further, fluctuations in NOK/USD may affect the presented figures of Point Resources, as the presentation currency is USD.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible increase or decrease in the NOK/USD exchange rate, holding all other variables constant:

31 December 2016 31 December 2017

INCREASE/ DECREASE IN
NOK/USD

EFFECT ON PROFIT BEFORE TAX (USD 1 000)

+/- 10 % +/- 10 %

+/- 1 959 +/- 45 804

EFFECT ON EQUITY
(USD 1 000)
+/- 97 +/- 24 732

(b) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Point Resources will encounter diffi culty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by monitoring its debt rating and the maturity dates of existing debt and other payables.
The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of resource based lending structures, bonds, parent company loan facility etc.

Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. See note 5.9 for comments regarding trade receivables ageing. Point Resources' maximum exposure is equal to the carrying amount of the receivables.
As part of the transaction with ExxonMobil in 2017, the seller has in the sale and purchase agreement agreed to pay parts of the decommissioning costs for Jotun and the Group has recorded a receivable against ExxonMobil to cover those costs that are within compensation threshold (note 4.2). The Group expects that all Jotun decommissioning costs will be refunded.

See note 5.5 for an overview of maturity profile on Point Resources' financial liabilities and accessible borrowing facility from Point Resources Holding AS.
(c) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obliga tions under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. Point Resources trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.

With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and derivative financial assets, the Group's exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counter party, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. The Group's limits its counterparty credit risk on these assets by dealing only with financial institutions with credit ratings of at least A or equivalent.
Management is of the opinion that Point Resources does not have significant credit risk.

5.3. Capital management

The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the require ments of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to share holders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. No changes have been made in the objectives, policies or processes since the inception of Point Resources in May 2016.
The Group's net debt includes interest-bearing loans and borrow ings, trade and other payables, less cash and cash deposits.

In order to achieve this overall objective, the Group's capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements. Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches of the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current period. Reference is made to section 5.5 for disclosed information regarding interest bearing debt and financial covenants.
The Company has not paid any dividend in 2017.

5.4. Share capital

The share capital in the Company at 31 December 2017 consists of Common shares. In 2017 all shares were converted to one class from Commom shares A which was weighted 35 percent, common shares B weighted 32 percent and common shares C weighted 33 percent.
The ultimate parent The Company is indirectly owned by private equity funds managed by HitecVision.

5.11. Fair Value measurement

Accounting policies - Fair value measurement All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are grouped into classes and categories. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period.

Fair value hierarchy The Group measures fair value using the fair value hierarchy as described below, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1: Level 2:
Level 3

Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities. Valuation techniques for which the lowest level that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable. Valuation techniques for which the lowest level that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

The table above discloses information about all assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.
There were no transfers between the levels during 2017 or 2016.
Fair value of financial instruments Below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Group's financial instruments.
The management assessed that the fair values of cash and short term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment

grade credit ratings. Commodity put options are valued using valuation techniques, which employ the use of market observable inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include observable inputs and use of present value calculations (hierarchy level 2). The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, oil price spot and forward rates and interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity (oil). All derivative contracts are fully cash collateralised, thereby eliminating both counterparty risk and the Group's own non-performance risk. As at 31 December 2017, the marked-to-market value of derivative asset positions is net of a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative counterparty default risk. The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on measurement of financial instruments recognised at fair value. The fair value calculations are made by the Group's respective bank relations.
The fair values of the Group's interest-bearing borrowings and loans are determined by using the DCF-method using discount rate that reflects the issuer's borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. Point Resources' own non-performance risk as at 31 December 2017 was assessed to be insignificant.

Point Resources Holding AS Board of Directors' report & Financial Statements 2017

6.1. Tax

Accounting policy - Tax Income tax in the statement of income comprises of current and deferred tax expense. Income tax is recognised in the statement of income except when it relates to items recognised in OCI. Current tax consists of the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable for previous years.
Uncertain tax positions and potential tax exposures are analysed individually. The best estimate of the probable amount for liabilities to be paid (unpaid potential tax exposure amounts, including penalties) and for assets to be received (disputed tax positions for which payment has already been made) in each case is recognised within current tax or deferred tax as appropriate.
A tax-free allowance (uplift) of 5.5 percent per year is granted on the basis of capitalised cost on offshore production installations

on NCS. The uplift is deductible from petroleum taxable income over a period of four years from the year the cost incurred. Uplift benefit on the NCS is recognised when the deduction is included in the current year tax return and impacts taxes payable. Unused uplift may be carried forward indefinitely.
Production installations can be depreciated linearly over six years. Depreciation can start as expenses are incurred. Any remaining cost may be deducted in the final year at the end of production.
Interest income and interest expenses relating to tax issues are estimated and recognised in the period in which they are earned or incurred and are presented within Net financial items in the statement of income.

1) For accounting purposes the income statement reflects the acquired operation from ExxonMobil from 1 November 2018. For tax and economic purposes, the effective date was 1 January 2017.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, subject to the initial recognition exemption. The amount of deferred tax is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Companies operating on the NCS under the offshore tax regime can claim the tax value of any unused tax losses or other tax credits related to its offshore activities to be paid in cash (including

interest) from the tax authorities when operations cease. Deferred tax assets that are based on offshore tax losses carried forward are therefore normally recognised in full.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset to the extent that the deferred taxes relate to the same fiscal authority, and there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities. After netting deferred tax assets and liabilities by fiscal entity, deferred taxes are presented on the balance sheet as follows:
Deferred tax assets are recognised based on the expectation that sufficient taxable income will be available through reversal of taxable temporary differences or future taxable income.

Section 8 Other disclosure

8.1. Subsequent events

In January 2018, the Group was awarded ten new licences in the APA 2017 licensing round. In two of the licences Point Resources was appointed operatorship.

13 March 2018, Point Resources AS successfully completed a senior unsecured bond issue of USD 250 million with maturity in September 2024.

2 March 2018, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate announced an oil discovery in production licence 340. Preliminary estimates indicate that the size of the discovery is between 5 and 10 million standard cubic meters (Sm3) of recoverable oil. The licencees will consider a tie-in of the discovery to the existing infrastructure in the Alvheim area. Point Resources AS has a 20 per cent participating interest.

On 5 April, the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy approved the plan for development and operation (PDO) for the Fenja field (PL586) in the Norwegian Sea. The Group has 45 percent ownership interest in the field.

8.2. Reserves (un-audited)

During 2017 the Fenja field (42.7 million boe) was reclassified from 2C (Contingent Resources) to 2P (Probable reserves).
Production on Balder, Ringhorne and Ringhorne Øst where 13.3 million boe before the business combination and is not reflected in the table above. For more information on the business combina tion see note 2.1. If the transaction with ExxonMobil had occurred 1 January 2017, total production for the Group would have been 17 million boe.
At year-end the reserves (2P) and contingent resources (2C) were 369 million barrels of oil equivalent.

As discussed in the accounting principles, estimation of oil and gas reserves and resources involves uncertainty. The figures above represent management's best judgement of the most likely quantity of economically recoverable oil and gas estimated at year-end 2017, given the information at the time of reporting. The estimates have a large spread especially for fields for which there is limited data available. The uncertainty will be reduced as more information becomes available through production history and reservoir appraisal. In addition, for fields in the decline phase with limited remaining volumes, fluctuations in oil prices will have a significant impact on the profitability and hence the economic cut-off for production.

8.4. Licences and joint arrangements

Accounting policy - Joint arrangements The Group undertakes a number of business activities through joint arrangements and unincorporated cooperation arrangements. According to IFRS 11 a joint arrangement is an arrangement over which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control over an arrangement which exists only when the decisions about the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement) require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. For unincorporated cooperation arrangements various voting rules not necessarily requiring unanimous consent apply.
Joint operations and unincorporated cooperation arrangements A joint operation is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement also have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Licences that are unincorporated cooperation agreements are out side of scope of IFRS 11, but the accounting is generally the same.

In relation to its interests in joint operations and unincorporated cooperation agreements, the Group recognises its share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flow on a line-by-line basis in the financial statements.
Point Resources' portfolio of licences Point Resources have investments in licences on NCS and most of its licences are considered to be joint operations. Point Resources is required to participate in the approved work programs for the licences, and does have joint responsibility for the obligations of its joint operations.
A list of all Point Resources' licences is given below, divided in fields in operation and fields not yet in operation.

8.5. Earnings per share

Accounting policy - Earnings per share Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Group by the weighted average

8.6. Net profit Interest

Accounting policy - Net profit interest The Norwegian state has large holdings in oil and gas licences on Norway's continental shelf (NCS) through the State's Direct Financial Interest (SDFI). The Balder, Ringhorne and Ringhorne Øst fields are subject to a Net profit interest ("NPI") as these fields are located on some of the first licences issued on the NCS. SDFI receive a share of the net profit of the few fields in Norway subject

to such agreements. Petoro is a state-owned limited company which manages the SDFI in the Norwegian oil and gas sector.
The net profit interest is calculated based quarterly cash flows. Losses in a quarter can be offset against profits in subsequent quarters. NPI related to abandonment costs incurred after cessation of production will be refunded by Petoro.

Point Resources Holding AS Board of Directors' report & Financial Statements 2017

Section 1 Background information

1.1. Corporate information

The financial statements of Point Resources Holding AS ("the Company" or "Point Resources") for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue in accordance with a Board res olution on 27 April 2018. Point Resources Holding AS is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Norway and the Company's shares are privately held. The Company's head office is located at Grenseveien 6, 4313 Sandnes, Norway.
Point Resources Holding AS is a holding company of Point Resources AS, a mid-sized, independent exploration and pro duction (E&P) company with a diverse portfolio of production, development and exploration assets on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS).

On 1 November 2017, Point Resources AS acquired ExxonMobil's operated upstream business in Norway from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Norway AS. The acquisition included a transfer of the majority of ExxonMobil's offshore and onshore E&P staff in Norway; a significant package of operated producing assets on the Norwegian Continental Shelf; field assets such as platforms and Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessels (FPSOs); as well as the Company's office building in Sandnes. More detailed information is included in note 2.1 in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.

1.2. Basis for preparation

The Company's financial statements consist of statements of comprehensive income, statements of financial position, state ments of cash flows, statements of changes in equity and related notes. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with section 3-9 of the Norwegian Accounting Act and the Regulation on Simplified IFRS as set out by the Ministry of Finance on 3 November 2014. Meaning that recognition and measurement are in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and presentation and disclosure is in accordance with Norwegian Accounting Act. The annual accounts have been approved by the Company's board of directors.
For all periods up to and including the year ending 31 December 2016, the Company prepared its accounts in accordance with Norwegian GAAP. The accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 are the first the Company have prepared in accordance with the Regulation on simplified IFRS. See Note 1.5 for information on how the Company has adopted IFRS.

The financial statements are prepared based on the going concern assumption.
The financial statements are presented in USD and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (000) except when otherwise indi cated. The parent company's functional currency is NOK. The Company has chosen to present its financial statements in USD, as this is a commonly used presentation currency among oil and gas companies.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the Company's entities at their respective functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. For presentation purposes, balance sheet items are translated from functional currency to presentation currency by using spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Items within total comprehensive income are translated from functional currency to presentation currency by use of average exchange rates for each month.

1.3. General accounting principles

Significant accounting judgements, estim ates and assumptions The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, the accompanying disclosures and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjust ment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affecting future periods. The Company bases its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements are prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future develop ments may change due to market changes or circumstances that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions as they occur.

Valuation and classification of assets and liabilities Assets intended for permanent ownership or use in the business are classified as non-current assets. Other assets are classified as current assets. Financially motivated investments in shares are classified as current assets, while strategic investments are classified as non-current assets. Receivables due within one year are classified as current assets. The classification of current and non-current liabilities is based on the same criteria.
Current assets are valued at the lower of historical cost and fair value. Fixed assets are carried at historical cost, but are written down to their recoverable amount if this is lower than the carrying amount and the reduction in value is expected to be permanent. Fixed assets with a limited economic life are depreciated in accordance with a reasonable depreciation schedule.

1.4. Standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
Refer to Note 1.5 in the Consolidated Financial Statements disclosing information of standards and amendments issued but not yet effective.

1.5. Transition note

As a the Company decided to change their accounting language from NGAAP to the Regulation on Simplified IFRS (2014), this implies individual changes of principles. The change from NGAAP to simplified IFRS will not have any effect on the Companys financial statemens as the recognicion of the initial numbers are in coherance with the regulation given in IFRS.

Deviations from IFRS: IAS 10 No. 12 and 13, IAS 18 No. 30 and IFRIC 17 No. 10 are waived so that dividends and group contributions are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of the Accounting Act.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, subject to the initial recognition exemption. The amount of deferred tax is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the asset can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset to the extent that the deferred taxes relate to the same fiscal authority, and there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities. After netting deferred tax assets and liabilities by fiscal entity, deferred taxes are presented on the balance sheet as follows:
Deferred tax assets are recognised based on the expectation that sufficient taxable income will be available through reversal of taxable temporary differences or future taxable income.

A uditor's Responsibilities fo r the A u d it o f the Financial Statem ents Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's and the Group's internal control.
· evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

· evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
