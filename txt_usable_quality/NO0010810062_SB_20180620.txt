(the "Bond Issue").

Okea AS 7.50% open callable senior secured USD 150,000,000 bonds 2017/2020

Oslo, 20 June 2018

Notice of Written Bondholders' Resolutions
Nordic Trustee AS (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders in the Bond Issue under the bond terms originally dated 14 November 2017 (the "Bond Terms").
Capitalised terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Bond Terms.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer, market conditions, the described transactions and otherwise isprovided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

1 BACKGROUND

The Issuer is in the process of acquiring the following licence interests (the "Licence Interests") on the Norwegian Continental Shelf from A/S Norske Shell, including an office building in Kristiansund (the "Transactions"):

Field name Licence no.

Acquired working interest

Draugen PL093, PL093B, PL093C, PL093D, PL158 and PL176 44.56%

Gjøa

PL153, PL153B and PL153C

12%

The total purchase price payable by the Issuer for the Licence Interests is NOK 4,520,000,000 as of 1 of January 2018.

The Transactions will be financed partly by the net proceeds from an approx. USD 180,000,000 bond issue ("New Bond Issue") and with the proceeds from an approx. USD 130,000,000 issuance of new shares in the capital o f the Issuer ("Equity Issue").

The Issuer currently has approx. USD 110,000,000 of the proceeds from the Bond Issue deposited on the blocked and pledged Escrow Account and which, under Clause 2.3 (Use o fproceeds) of the Bond Terms and until the First Oil Date for Yme Licences, shall only be employed to fund the Issuer's part of the Yme Development Costs. According to the Company's estimates, approx. USD 50,000,000 of the funds on the Escrow Account would be used towards Yme Development Costs in the period up to the estimated time of closing of the Transactions.

1

Final version
The Draugen and Gjoa assets have been producing for more than 30 years combined, and the Company estimates that assets will have generated more than USD 230,000,000 in net cash flow to the Company in the period from settlement of the Transaction until Q4 2019, which is sufficient to cover all planned development expenses of the Issuer's current development portfolio, including Yme. Since the cash flow from the Draugen and Gjoa assets will be sufficient to fund the development of Yme, the Company wishes to use the funds on the Escrow Account towards financing the Transaction.
By this notice, the Issuer is therefore requesting the consent of the Bondholders to (i) use the entire balance on the Escrow Account towards financing the completion of the Transactions and (ii) make other changes to the provisions of the Bond Terms to align the same with the terms of the new bond issue intended to partly finance the Transaction, including for calculation of EBITDA to reflect the acquisition of producing assets and change the definition of the Change of Control of the Bond Terms to reflect the new Equity injection, in each case as further set out in section 2 {The Proposal) below. By submitting the Proposal to the Bondholders the Issuer has agreed to be bound by the terms.
