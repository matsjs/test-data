BACKGROUND

Reference is made to the Bondholders' Meeting held on 5 August 2011 for the Bonds, in which the Secured Bondholders and the Unsecured Bondholders voted in favour of a proposal to, among other things, defer payments of interest and to introduce a stand-still period until 30 September 2011 in order to allow the Issuer to continue its operations in the short term while seeking to reach agreement with its major stakeholders on a long-term restructuring solution for its business.

Since the Bondholders' Meeting held on 5 August 2011, the Bond Trustee and the financial and the legal advisers retained to represent the Bond Tfustee and the interests of the Bondholders (the "Bond Trustee's Advisers") have been in discussions with the Issuer and other relevant stakeholders and have continued their due diligence investigations of the Issuer and its business. The Bond Trustee's Advisers have also continued their discussions and held further meetings with an informal group of institutions that are understood to be the largest Bondholders across all classes of the Bonds, holding in excess of 50% of the Outstanding Bonds in each class of the Bonds (the "Restricted Bondholders").

The Bond Trustee's Advisers have been in continuous discussions and held numerous meetings with the Issuer and its advisers to find a proposal for a solvent restructuring of the Bonds and the Issuer's share capital. Furthermore, the Bond Trustee's Advisers have had extensive discussions with Teekay Corporation ("Teekay"), who, in early September 2011, presented an indicative non-binding offer to acquire the Issuer's three FPSOs. Teekay is one of the world's largest operators and owners of oil tankers, LNG vessels, and FPSOs/FSOs. The Teekay group consists of four NYSE listed companies. Teekay has a long history of demonstrated ability to complete large M&A transactions.

Following the Issuer's receipt of the indicative offer from Teekay, the Issuer, Teekay and the Bond Trustee's Advisers have negotiated and agreed on the key terms for the acquisition by Teekay of the Issuer's FPSOs and the restructuring of the Bonds and the Issuer's share capital (the "Restructuring"). In addition, the Restricted Bondholders have negotiated and agreed certain intra bondholders arrangements between the various classes of the Bonds in connection with the overall economic deal for the Restructuring, which was necessary to procure the support of the largest

Unsecured Bondholders (the "Intra-Bondholders Arrangements"). A solvent restructuring of the Issuer and the Bonds is not possible without the requisite consent of each class of Bonds. The key terms of the Restructuring are described in the Issuer's announcement of 18 October 2011 (the "Issuer's Announcement"), and the key terms of the Intra-Bondholders Arrangements have been set out in the bondholder term sheet attached in an agreed form to the Restructuring Agreement (as defined below) (the "Bondholder Term Sheet"), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1 to this summons. The Issuer's Announcement and the Bondholder Term Sheet were both attached to the Bond Trustee's summary update of the Restructuring that was posted on Stamdata on 18 October 2011, and the Issuer's Announcement is also available at the Issuer's website www.sevanmarine.com.
On 18 October 2011, the Issuer and Bondholders holding more than 2/3 of the Outstanding Bonds for each class of the Bonds (the "Participating Bondholders") agreed upon the terms of, and to support the implementation of, the Restructuring, which have been documented in a separate restructuring and lock-up agreement between the Issuer and the Participating Bondholders (the "Restructuring Agreement").
The key elements o f the Restructuring comprise:
(i) an acquisition of the Issuer's three FPSOs (the "FPSO Transactions") for a total cash amount of USD 668 million (the "Purchase Price"), of which a total of USD 438 million shall be distributed among the Bondholders in the manner set out in clause 3(A) to settle certain of the Issuer's external debt in full (including through the redemption of the Secured Bonds at less than par value) and towards the payment of the Advisory Fees (as defined in section 3(A)(VII) below);
(ii) full settlement of the Unsecured Bonds by (x) either the transfer of the Issuer's 96,000,000 shares in Sevan Drilling ASA (the "Drilling Shares") to the Unsecured SPV (as defined in section 3(A)(IV) below), or the payment to the Unsecured Bondholders of the balance of the proceeds received by the Issuer (or, in certain circumstances, the Unsecured SPV) upon a sale of the Drilling Shares after all outstanding indebtedness (including, without limitation, principal, call premium and accrued interest) due under the Bridge Loan Bonds has been repaid from such proceeds, and (y) the issue to the Unsecured Bondholders of 10% of the pro forma share capital of the Issuer on a fully diluted basis following the Restructuring by way of a debt for equity conversion (the "Unsecured Bond Conversion");
(iii) an increase of the Issuer's equity by an amount of up to USD 50 million through a USD 25 million cash subscription of new shares by Teekay (the "Teekay Placement") giving Teekay an ownership of 40% of all outstanding shares in the Issuer after the Restructuring on a fully diluted basis (assuming full subscription), and up to USD 25 million cash subscription for new shares by the shareholders of the Issuer (the "Initial Shareholders") and the Unsecured Bondholders (the "Stakeholder Placement", and together with the Teekay Placement the "Placements"), provided that the Unsecured Bondholders shall be entitled (assuming full subscription) to subscribe for up to 25% of the new shares issued pursuant to the Stakeholder Placement, giving the Initial Shareholders and the Unsecured Bondholders (in addition to the shares already owned by the Initial Shareholders and the shares issued to the Unsecured

Bondholders following the Unsecured Bond Conversion) an ownership of 40% of all outstanding shares in the Issuer after the Restructuring on a fully diluted basis (assuming full subscription); and

(iv) funding by Teekay of the completion of the upgrade of the FPSO Voyageur (prior to Teekay's acquisition o f that FPSO) through a bridge loan to the Issuer (the "Teekay Bridge Loan").

Under the terms of the Restructuring, the shares held by the Initial Shareholders will be diluted as a result of the Placements. Immediately after the Placements, the share capital of the Issuer will be held on the following basis (assuming subscription in full for the Placements):

Teekay will hold 40% of the share capital of the Issuer; the Initial Shareholders and the Unsecured Bondholders will, as a result of the Stakeholder Placement, hold 40% of the share capital of the Issuer; the Initial Shareholders will hold 10% of the share capital of the Issuer, in addition to any shares subscribed for and allocated in the Stakeholder Placement; and the Unsecured Bondholders will hold 10% of the share capital of the Issuer, in addition to any shares subscribed for and allocated in the Stakeholder Placement.

Following completion of the Restructuring, Teekay will, pursuant to the Norwegian Securities Trading Act, be required to make a mandatory offer for the shares in the Issuer not held by Teekay. Such mandatory offer will not extend to any shares issued to the Unsecured Bondholders in the Unsecured Debt Conversion or any shares subscribed for in the Stakeholder Placement.

The Participating Bondholders have undertaken to vote in favour of a proposal to implement and consummate the Restructuring, subject to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement. The Issuer will on or about the date hereof.convene an extraordinary general meeting (the "EGM") of its shareholders to be held on or about 14 November 2011 in, order to approve the.various resolutions required to implement the Restructuring.

RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL

In accordance with the relevant provisions under the Bond Agreements, the Issuer has requested the Bond Trustee to convene a Bondholders' meeting for each class of the Bonds to obtain the necessary consents and approvals to enable the Issuer to complete and implement the Restructuring. Accordingly, the Issuer requests the Bondholders' meetings to approve the following proposals in relation to the Restructuring (the "Proposals"):

(A) Settlement of the Bonds

This section summarises the key terms of the proposed transaction with Teekay insofar as it relates to the Bonds. However, the Intra-Bondholders Arrangements summarised in sub-section (VI) below will affect the ultimate recoveries for Bondholders.

(I) The Piranema Bonds

All of the indebtedness (principal, default premium and accrued interest) under the Piranema Bonds shall be settled in full, and all the Loan Security shall be released, upon the payment by the Issuer of the "Piranema Recovery Amount" (being USD 165 million less a portion of the Advisory Fees calculated as set out in sub-section (VII) below) upon the completion of the acquisition by Teekay of the FPSO Piranema and the FPSO Hummingbird ("First Completion").

(II) The Hummingbird Bonds

All of the indebtedness (principal, default premium and accrued interest) under the Hummingbird Bonds shall be settled in full, and all the Security Interests shall be released, upon the payment by the Issuer of the "Hummingbird Recovery Amount" (being USD 179 million less a portion of the Advisory Fees calculated as set out in sub-section (VII) below) upon First Completion.

(III) The Voyageur Bonds

All of the indebtedness (principal, default premium and accrued interest) under the Voyageur Bonds

shall be settled in full upon the payment by the Issuer or Teekay of the "Voyageur Recovery Amount"

(being USD 94 million less a portion of the Advisory Fees calculated as set out in sub-section (VII)

below) upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date that is 12 months after the date of First Completion, (ii)

15 December 2012, (iii)-the date of the completion of the acquisition of the FPSO Voyageur by

Teekay (the "Voyageur Completion"), or (iv) such earlier date as Teekay shall determine in its sole

discretion.

.

'

.

All the Loan Security securing the Voyageur Bonds shall be released at First Completion in exchange for the grant by Teekay Corporation of an irrevocable, unconditional and absolute payment guarantee for the Voyageur Recovery Amount in favour of the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Voyageur Bondholders) (the "Teekay Voyageur Guarantee").

(IV) The Unsecured Bonds

In conjunction with the treatment of the Drilling Shares contemplated in the paragraph below, all of the indebtedness (principal, default premium and accrued interest) under the Unsecured Bonds shall be exchanged for an issue of new ordinary shares of the Issuer (the "Unsecured Equity") representing 50% of the share capital of the Issuer prior to the Placements and 10% of the pro forma share capital of the Issuer immediately following the Restructuring (assuming the occurrence o f the Teekay Placement and that the Stakeholder Placement is subscribed in full). Upon the conversion of the Unsecured Bonds into shares, no fractions of shares will be issued, and the number of new shares issued to each Unsecured Bondholder will be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The new

5

shares will be listed on Oslo Børs upon the publication by the Issuer of a listing and offering prospectus (the "Prospectus").

In conjunction with the issuance of the Unsecured Equity contemplated in the paragraph above, all of the indebtedness (principal, default premium and accrued interest) under the Unsecured Bonds shall be settled in full by either (i) the establishment of a newly formed entity that shall be owned by the holders of the Unsecured Bonds (the "Unsecured SPV") to which entity shall be transferred the Drilling Shares, subject always to the pledge that exists and secures the Bridge Loan Bonds, or (ii) the payment to the Unsecured Bondholders of the balance of the proceeds received by the Issuer (or, in certain circumstances, the Unsecured SPV) upon a sale of the Drilling Shares after all outstanding indebtedness (including, without limitation, principal, call premium and accrued interest) due under the Bridge Loan Bonds have been repaid from such proceeds.

The Unsecured Bondholders of record as at the last Business Day prior to completion of the Unsecured Equity Conversion (the "Record Date"), which date shall be announced at least three clear Business Days prior to the Record Date, will be afforded the right to participate (and to oversubscribe) in the Stakeholder Placement on the same terms as the Initial Shareholders. In the event that the Stakeholder Placement is oversubscribed, the Unsecured Bondholders shall have the right to be allocated on a pro rata basis amongst the Unsecured Bondholders in accordance with their individual pro forma shareholdings in the Issuer as a percentage of all shares in the Issuer to be issued as part of the Unsecured Bond Conversion, 25% of the total amount of the Stakeholder Placement, which if fully subscribed by the Unsecured Bondholders on a pro rata basis will result in an ownership of 10% of all outstanding shares in the Issuer immediately following the Restructuring on a fully diluted basis.

(V) The Bridge Loan Bonds

. * ,

' 4'

Following the date on which the Restructuring Agreement became effective, a committee appointed by

representatives of each class of the Restricted Bondholders shall seek to procure the sale of the

Drilling Shares to a third party purchaser on or before the later to occur of (i) First Completion, of (ii)

the end of the Interim Completion Period, at the maximum consideration available during such period,

but subject to a minimum consideration of USD 63.3 million.

If the Drilling Shares have been sold after the EGM but prior to the later to occur of (i) First Completion or (ii) the end of the Interim Completion Period, the purchase price for the Drilling Shares will be used to immediately repay all outstanding indebtedness then owing (including, without limitation, principal, call premium and accrued interest) under the Bridge Loan Bonds, with the balance (the "Drilling Share Proceeds") being paid into an escrow account on the following terms (together the "Escrow Arrangements"):

(a) upon the later to occur of (i) First Completion, or (ii) the expiry of the Interim Completion Period, the Drilling Share Proceeds will be paid to the Unsecured Bondholders (subject to any adjustment for allocation of the Advisory Fees as per section 15 of the Bondholder Term Sheet); and

(b) upon the earlier of (x) a bankruptcy of the Issuer or (y) the Restructuring Agreement being terminated in accordance with its terms (other than due to the occurrence of First Completion

or the failure to achieve First Completion by 31 January 2012), whether automatically or by any party thereto, the Drilling Share Proceeds will be paid to the Issuer or the bankruptcy estate of the Issuer (as applicable).
If the Drilling Shares have not been sold prior to First Completion:
(a) the Drilling Shares will be transferred by the Issuer to the Unsecured SPV, and the Unsecured SPV will replace the Issuer as borrower under the Bridge Loan Bonds. The Drilling Shares will be transferred subject to the pledge that exists in relation to the Bridge Loan Bonds; and
(b) the indebtedness under the Bridge Loan Bonds (principal, call premium and accrued interest) shall be repaid in accordance with the terms of the Bond Agreement for the Bridge Loan Bonds (the "Bridge Loan Bond Agreement") in the manner contemplated by sub-section (V)(c) below; and
(c) if First Completion occurs and the Bridge Loan Bond Tender is completed, the terms of the Bridge Loan Bond Agreement shall be amended with effect from completion of the Bridge Loan Bond Tender so that the Maturity Date is extended to 22 July 2014 (the "Bridge Loan Bond Amendment").
(VI) The Intra-Bondholders Arrangements
As set out in further detail in the Bondholder Term Sheet, the Bondholders shall make the following additional payments and transfers between themselves in order to give effect to the Intra-Bondholders Arrangements:
(a) If First Completion occurs, and the Drilling Shares have been sold during the period of 21 clear days following the EGM (the "Interim Completion Period") for a consideration of USD 75 million or more, then:
(i) the Secured Bondholders shall in aggregate contribute from their recovery proceeds an amount of approximately USD 6.5 million for distribution to the Unsecured Bondholders, provided that such payment shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis, but not below zero, to the extent that the consideration received by the Unsecured Bondholders in connection with a sale of the Drilling Shares exceeds USD 75 million; and
(ii) if the Bond Trustee has, at any time prior to the date of the EGM, received an irrevocable notice in writing from Unsecured Bondholders holding more than 50% of the outstanding Unsecured Bonds indicating that the Unsecured Bondholders wish to transfer all Unsecured Equity to the Secured Bondholders (an "Unsecured Equity Notice"), the Secured Bondholders shall acquire all of the Unsecured Equity from the Unsecured Bondholders in consideration for an aggregate cash payment from their recovery proceeds of USD 6.25 million.

(b) If First Completion occurs and prior to or during the Interim Completion Period, the Drilling Shares have either not been sold or have been sold for less than USD 75 million, then:
(i) the Secured Bondholders shall in aggregate contribute an amount from their recovery proceeds of approximately USD 18.2 million for distribution to the Unsecured Bondholders (subject to any adjustment for allocation of Advisory Fees as per section 15 of the Bondholder Term Sheet), provided that such payment shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis, but not below zero, to the extent that the consideration received by the Unsecured Bondholders in connection with a sale of the Drilling Shares exceeds USD 63.3 million; and
(ii) if the Drilling Shares have been sold for at least USD 63.3 million but less than USD 75 million prior to or during the Interim Completion Period and the Bond Trustee has, at any time prior to the date of the EGM, received an Unsecured Equity Notice, the Secured Bondholders shall acquire all of the Unsecured Equity from the Unsecured Bondholders in consideration for an aggregate cash payment from their recovery proceeds of USD 6.25 million.
(c) If First Completion occurs and prior to or during the Interim Completion Period, the Drilling Shares have not been sold, then in order to ensure that the Bridge Loan Bonds are either repaid in full or acquired by the Unsecured Bondholders (or the Underwriting Bondholders (as defined below)):
(i) an amount of approximately USD 10.5 million of the proceeds payable by the Secured Bondholders from then recovery proceeds to the Unsecured Bondholders at the later to occur of (i) First Completion, or (ii) the end of the Interim Completion Period will be applied as a partial repayment of the Bridge Loan Bonds held by the Secured Bondholders;
(ii) the Secured Bondholders holding Bridge Loan Bonds will have agreed to undertake to tender their Bridge Loan Bonds for sale to the Unsecured Bondholders and certain underwriting Bondholders, who will have agreed to provide an aggregate subscription commitment of USD 18 million (the "Underwriting Bondholders") at a purchase price equal to the outstanding indebtedness (including, without limitation, principal, call premium and accrued interest) under the Bridge Loan Bonds owned by the Secured Bondholders as at the date of settlement of the tender (the "Bridge Loan Bond Tender");
(iii) the Bridge Loan Bond Tender will be allocated amongst subscribing Bondholders (including the Underwriting Bondholders) on a pro rata basis (calculated by reference to their respective subscriptions for the Bridge Loan Bonds tendered in the Bridge Loan Bond Tender against the aggregate amount of subscriptions received pursuant to the Bridge Loan Bond Tender), provided, however, that the allocation of Bridge Loan Bonds shall be adjusted to ensure that if a subscribing Bondholder has submitted a subscription for Bridge Loan Bonds at least equal to their pro rata percentage holding
8

of Unsecured Bonds, such subscribing Bondholder shall not receive an allocation of Bridge Loan Bonds which is less than their pro rata percentage of the Bridge Loan Bonds that are tendered in the Bridge Loan Bond Tender, calculated by reference to their holding of Unsecured Bonds; and
(iv) after completion of the Bridge Loan Bond Tender, the Unsecured Bondholders and the Underwriting Bondholders participating in the Bridge Loan Bond Tender shall be paid out of the proceeds otherwise payable to the Unsecured Bondholders, on a pro rata basis by reference to the amount of Bridge Loan Bonds acquired by them, an amount equal to USD 3.2 million plus an amount equal to the interest accrued on the Bridge Loan Bonds from 29 September 2011 until the completion of the Bridge Loan Bond Tender.
(d) Subject to First Completion occurring and completion of the Bridge Loan Bond Tender, the Unsecured Bondholders authorise that the Unsecured SPV may enter into the Bridge Loan Bond Amendment (as defined in sub-section (V) above) upon the assumption by the Unsecured SPV of all of the Issuer's obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Bridge Loan Bonds under the Bond Agreement for the Bridge Loan Bonds in the manner contemplated below.
Further details for the arrangements between the Secured Bondholders and the Unsecured Bondholders, including allocation and timing of payments between the Bondholders in the different classes of Bonds, are set out in the Bondholder Term Sheet, which all Bondholders should review in detail.
(VII) Payment o fAdvisory Fees
Payment of the following fees shall be covered by the Purchase Price: (i) the fees incurred and payable by the Issuer to the Bond Trustee's Advisers in connection with the Restructuring with respect to the period from 1 October 2011 up to the date of First Completion, including up until completion of the Restructuring; (ii) the unpaid fees of the Issuer's Norwegian legal counsel properly incurred by the Issuer which relate specifically to the FPSO Transactions (including the Teekay Bridge Loan) and the Unsecured Bond Conversion with respect to the period from 1 October 2011 up to the date of First Completion, (iii) the reasonable administrative and legal fees incurred by the Issuer directly in connection with it acting on the instructions of the Secured Sub-Committee Members (as defined in the Bondholder Term Sheet) in connection with a sale of the Drilling Shares, and (iv) the USD 1 million success fee payable by the Issuer to Alix Partners ((i) through (iv) being, the "Advisory Fees").
The Advisory Fees shall initially be borne by the Secured Bondholders, and allocated between the Hummingbird Bondholders, the Piranema Bondholders and the Voyageur Bondholders pro rata to the principal face amount outstanding, so that their respective contributions to the Advisory Costs shall be calculated to be the total amount of the Advisory Fees as at First Completion multiplied by the following percentages:
Piranema Bondholders: X%;
9

Hummingbird Bondholders: Y%; and
Voyageur Bondholders: Z%
Where:
"X % " means (the USD principal face amount outstanding of the Piranema Bonds on the EGM Date) / (the Aggregate Bonds) * 100
"Y%" means (the USD principal face amount outstanding of the Hummingbird Bonds on the EGM Date, converting the NOK Hummingbird Bonds into USD at the FX Rate) / (the Aggregate Bonds) * 100
"Z % " means (the USD principal face amount outstanding of the Voyageur Bonds on the EGM Date, converting the Voyageur Bonds into USD at the FX Rate) / (the Aggregate Bonds) * 100
"Aggregate Bonds" means the aggregate USD principal face amount outstanding of the Piranema Bonds, Hummingbird Bonds (converting the NOK Hummingbird Bonds into USD at the FX Rate) and the Voyageur Bonds (converting the Voyageur Bonds into USD at the FX Rate).

"FX Rate" means the USD/NOK exchange rate quoted on Reuters at 12:00 Oslo time on the EGM Date.
Once the total gross recoveries o f the Unsecured Bondholders have been ascertained (on the basis of whether or not .(and at what price) the Drilling Shares have been sold prior to or during^the Interim Completion Period), then the allocation of the Advisory Fees shall be recalculated by reference to the total gross recoveries of the Unsecured Bondholders measured against the total gross recoveries of the Existing Bondholders, as set out in more detail in section 15 o f the Bondholder Term Sheet.
(B) Allocation of payments and distributions between Bondholders in each Bond
Any monies to be paid or securities to be received by any individual Bondholder in any class of the Bonds in connection with the Restructuring shall be applied on a pro rata basis to the Bondholders in that class of Bonds by reference to each relevant Bondholder's holding o f Bonds in that class of Bonds (based on the amount of principal, default premium and accrued interest in respect of such Bonds as at the relevant record date).
Any monies to be paid or securities to be received by the Hummingbird Bondholders in connection with the Restructuring shall be applied on a pro rata basis in the manner contemplated above, provided that any such monies or securities received by the Hummingbird Bondholders shall be allocated between the Hummingbird Bondholders holding USD Hummingbird Bonds and the Hummingbird Bondholders holding NOK Hummingbird Bonds, respectively, in the following percentages:

Hummingbird Bondholders holding USD Hummingbird Bonds: A%; and

Hummingbird Bondholders holding NOK Hummingbird Bonds: B%,

Where:

"A % " means (the USD principal face amount outstanding of the USD Hummingbird Bonds on the EGM Date) / (the Aggregate Hummingbird Bonds) * 100;

"B%" means (the USD principal face amount outstanding of the NOK Hummingbird Bonds on the EGM Date, converted into USD at the FX Rate) / (the Aggregate Hummingbird Bonds) * 100; and

"Aggregate Hummingbird Bonds" means the aggregate of the USD principal face amount outstanding of the USD Hummingbird Bonds and the NOK Hummingbird Bonds (converting the NOK Hummingbird Bonds into USD at the FX Rate).

(C) The Teekay Bridge Loan

Teekay will fund all costs associated with completing the upgrade of the FPSO Voyageur by way of

the Teekay Bridge Loan on terms customary for a financing of this kind. The Teekay Bridge Loan will

be secured as from First Completion by way of a second priority mortgage over the FPSO Voyageur

(with the existing second priority mortgage (and all other security thereunder) under the Voyageur

Bonds being released in exchange for the Teekay Voyageur Guarantee). In addition, prior to first

drawdown of the loan (which is expected to take place prior to First Completion), the Teekay Bridge

Loan shall be secured by a mortgage over such other assets as are available for security including,

inter alia, the shares or ownership interests in the entities holding Hulls 4 and 5 or, if reasonably

possible, the Hulls, and all patents with the Issuer registered as patent holder (on a...best available

priority).
