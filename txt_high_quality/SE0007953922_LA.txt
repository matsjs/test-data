THE AMOUNT OF THE BONDS AND UNDERTAKING TO MAKE PAYMENTS
The aggregate amount of the bond loan will be an amount of up to SEK 350,000,000 which will be represented by Bonds, each of an initial nominal amount of SEK 1,000,000 or full multiples thereof (the "Initial Nominal Amount").

All Initial Bonds are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of one hundred (100.00) per cent, of the Nominal Amount. The nominal amount of each Bond will be the Initial Nominal Amount, less the aggregate amount by which each Bond has been partly redeemed by the Issuer pursuant to Clause 11.4 ( Voluntary partial redemption by the Issuer) (the "Nominal Amount"). The ISIN for the Bonds is SE0007953922. The minimum permissible investment (e.g., subscription and allotment) in connection with the Initial Bond Issue is SEK 1,000,000.
The Issuer may at one or more occasions after the Issue Date issue Subsequent Bonds under these Terms and Conditions (each such issue, a "Subsequent Bond Issue"), until the total amount under such Subsequent Bond Issue(s) and the Initial Bond Issue equals SEK 350.000.000. Any Subsequent Bonds shall be issued subject to the same Terms and Conditions as the Initial Bonds. The price of Subsequent Bonds may be set at a discount or at a higher price than the Nominal Amount.
The Issuer undertakes to repay the Bonds, to pay Interest and to otherwise act in accordance and comply with these Terms and Conditions.
The Bonds are denominated in SEK and each Bond is constituted by these Terms and Conditions.
By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Holder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to these Terms and Conditions and by acquiring Bonds each subsequent Holder confirms these Terms and Conditions.
STATUS OF THE BONDS
The Bonds constitute direct, general, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu with all direct, general, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer, except those obligations which are mandatorily preferred by law, and without any preference among them.
USE OF PROCEEDS
The Issuer shall establish the Escrow Account prior to the Issue Date. On the Issue Date, the Issuing Agent shall transfer an amount of the Net Proceeds corresponding to SEK 200.000. 000 (plus an amount, rounded up to SEK 1,700,000, to cover the final interest
10

payment to be made on the final redemption date for the Existing Bonds) to the Escrow Account. For the purpose of securing that the Conditions Precedent for Disbursement have been fulfilled before any disbursement of the Net Proceeds is made, the Escrow Account will be pledged in favour of the Agent and the Holders (represented by the Agent). The pledge over the Escrow Account shall be released when the Existing Bonds have been redeemed in full.

4.2

Upon fulfilment of the Conditions Precedent for Disbursement set out in either Clause

5.1 (a) or (b) have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the Agent (acting reasonably), the

Agent shall instruct the account bank to make the relevant transfer from the Escrow

Account. The Net Proceeds shall then be used towards the redemption of the Existing Bonds

in full (including accrued but unpaid interest on the Existing Bonds on the final redemption

date for the Existing Bonds and any costs and expenses incurred by the agent under the

Existing Bonds). For the avoidance of doubt, the Net Proceeds may be used for repurchase

of Existing Bonds, provided that such repurchased Existing Bonds are retained until the final

redemption date and not sold or cancelled. Any remaining Net Proceeds and the net proceeds

from any Subsequent Bond Issue shall be used for general corporate purposes.

5.

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT FOR DISBURSEMENT

5.1

The Agent's approval of the disbursements from the Escrow Account of the relevant Net

Proceeds is subject to the following documents having been received by the Agent, in form

and substance satisfactory to the Agent (acting reasonably):

(a) a copy of a purchase order or similar document evidencing that the amounts to be released from the Escrow Account shall be used in full towards repurchase of Existing Bond(s), together with a confirmation that such repurchased Existing Bonds will be retained until the final redemption date and not sold or cancelled; or

(b) copies of duly executed and issued unconditional and irrevocable instruction(s) from the Issuer to the CSD for the redemption of the Existing Bonds in full, together with accrued but unpaid interest, such redemption to take place on the final redemption date for the Existing Bonds in connection with the disbursement from the Escrow Account (however, with due regard to the payment mechanisms of the CSD).

5.2

When the Conditions Precedent for Disbursement set out in either item (a) or (b) above have

been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the Agent (acting reasonably), the Agent shall instruct the

account bank to make the relevant transfer from the Escrow Account for the purpose of

either (a) repurchasing Existing Bonds or (b) redeeming the Existing Bonds in full, together

with accrued but unpaid interest.

The Agent may assume that the documents presented under Clause 5.1 are correct, and the Agent shall not be responsible or liable for the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of such documents.

THE BONDS AND TRANSFERABILITY

6.1

Each Holder is bound by these Terms and Conditions without there being any further actions

required to be taken or formalities to be complied with.

The Bonds are freely transferable. All Bond transfers are subject to these Terms and

Conditions and these Terms and Conditions are automatically applicable in relation to all

Bond transferees upon completed transfer.

6.3

Upon a transfer of Bonds, any rights and obligations under these Terms and Conditions

relating to such Bonds are automatically transferred to the transferee.

6.4

No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public

offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other

material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden, where

action for that purpose is required. Each Holder must inform itself about, and observe, any

applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds, (due to,

e.g., its nationality, its residency, its registered address or its place(s) of business). Each

Holder must ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.

6.5

For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the above, a Holder which allegedly has

purchased Bonds in contradiction to mandatory restrictions applicable may nevertheless

utilise its voting rights under these Terms and Conditions and shall be entitled to exercise its

full rights as a Holder hereunder in each case until such allegations have been resolved.

7.

BONDS IN BOOK-ENTRY FORM

Parents Code (Sw. foraldrabalken (1949:381)), conditions of will or deed of gift or

entitlements to receive payment in accordance with the Financial Instruments Accounts Act.

7.3

The Issuer (and the Agent when permitted under the CSD's applicable regulations) shall be

entitled to obtain information from the debt register (Sw. skuldbok) kept by the CSD in

respect of the Bonds. At the request of the Agent, the Issuer shall promptly obtain such

information and provide it to the Agent.

7.4

For the purpose of or in connection with any Holders' Meeting or any Written Procedure, the

Issuing Agent shall be entitled to obtain information from the debt register kept by the CSD

in respect of the Bonds. If the Agent does not otherwise obtain information from such debt

register as contemplated under these Terms and Conditions, the Issuing Agent shall at the

request of the Agent obtain information from the debt register and provide it to the Agent.

12

7.5

The Issuer shall issue any necessary power of attorney to such persons employed by the

Agent, as notified by the Agent, in order for such individuals to independently obtain

information directly from the debt register kept by the CSD in respect of the Bonds. The

Issuer may not revoke any such power of attorney unless directed by the Agent or unless

consent thereto is given by the Holders.

7.6

At the request of the Agent, the Issuer shall promptly instruct the Issuing Agent to obtain

information from the debt register kept by the CSD in respect of the Bonds and provide it to

the Agent.

7.7

The Issuer (and the Agent when permitted under the CSD's applicable regulations) may use

the information referred to in Clause 7.3 only for the purposes of carrying out their duties

and exercising their rights in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and shall not

disclose such information to any Holder or third party unless necessary for such purposes.

8.

RIGHT TO ACT ON BEHALF OF A HOLDER

8.1

If any Person other than a Holder wishes to exercise any rights under these Terms and

Conditions, it must obtain a power of attorney (or, if applicable, a coherent chain of powers

of attorney), a certificate from the authorised nominee or other sufficient proof of

authorisation for such Person.

8.2

A Holder may issue one or several powers of attorney to third parties to represent it in

relation to some or all of the Bonds held by it. Any such representative may act

independently under these Terms and Conditions in relation to the Bonds for which such

representative is entitled to represent the Holder.

8.3

The Agent shall only have to examine the face of a power of attorney or other proof of

authorisation that has been provided to it pursuant to Clause 8.1 and 8.2 and may assume

that it has been duly authorised, is valid, has not been revoked or superseded and that it is in

full force and effect, unless otherwise is apparent from its face.

9.

PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE BONDS

9.1

Any payment or repayment under these Terms and Conditions, or any amount due in respect

of a repurchase of any Bonds, shall be made to such Person who is registered as a Holder on

the Record Date prior to the relevant payment date, or to such other Person who is registered

with the CSD on such date as being entitled to receive the relevant payment, repayment or

repurchase amount.

9.2

If a Holder has registered, through an Account Operator, that principal, Interest and any

other payment that shall be made under these Terms and Conditions shall be deposited in a

certain bank account; such deposits will be effected by the CSD on the relevant payment

date. In other cases, payments will be transferred by the CSD to the Holder at the address

registered with the CSD on the Record Date. Should the CSD, due to a delay on behalf of the

Issuer or some other obstacle, not be able to effect payments as aforesaid, the Issuer shall

procure that such amounts are paid to the Persons who are registered as Holders on the

relevant Record Date as soon as possible after such obstacle has been removed.

13

9.3

If, due to any obstacle for the CSD, the Issuer cannot, make a payment or repayment, such

payment or repayment may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed. Interest shall

accrue in accordance with Clause 10.4 during such postponement.

9.4

If payment or repayment is made in accordance with this Clause 9, the Issuer and the CSD

shall be deemed to have fulfilled their obligation to pay, irrespective of whether such

payment was made to a Person not entitled to receive such amount, unless the Issuer or the

CSD (as applicable) was aware of that the payment was being made to a Person not entitled

to receive such amount.

9.5

The Issuer shall pay any stamp duty and other public fees accruing in connection with the

Initial Bond Issue or a Subsequent Bond Issue, but not in respect of trading in the secondary

market (except to the extent required by applicable law), and shall deduct at source any

applicable withholding tax payable pursuant to law. The Issuer shall not be liable to

reimburse any stamp duty or public fee or to gross-up any payments under these Terms and

Conditions by virtue of any withholding tax.

10.

INTEREST

10.1

The Bonds will bear Interest at the Interest Rate applied to the Nominal Amount from, but

excluding, the Issue Date up to and including the relevant Redemption Date. Any

Subsequent Bond will, however, carry Interest at the Interest Rate from, but excluding, the

Interest Payment Date falling immediately prior to its issuance up to and including the

relevant Redemption Date.

10.2

Interest accrues during an Interest Period. Payment of Interest in respect of the Bonds shall

be made quarterly in arrears to the Holders on each Interest Payment Date for the preceding

Interest Period.

10.3

Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the Interest Period in

respect of which payment is being made divided by 360 (actual/360-days basis).

10.4

If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it under these Terms and Conditions on its

due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from, but excluding, the due

date up to and including the date of actual payment at a rate which is 200 basis points higher

than the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest

shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Agent or the CSD, in

which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.

11.

REDEMPTION AND REPURCHASE OF THE BONDS

11.1

Redemption at maturity

The Issuer shall redeem all, but not only some, of the Bonds in full on the Final Redemption Date (or, to the extent such day is not a Business Day and if permitted under the CSD's applicable regulations, on the Business Day following from an application of the Business Day Convention, and otherwise on the first following Business Day) with an amount per Bond equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest.

The fifteen (15) calendar days' period may not start earlier than upon the occurrence of the Change of Control Event, De-listing Event or Listing Failure.
The notice from the Issuer pursuant to Clause 12.9.1 (e) shall specify the repurchase date and include instructions about the actions that a Holder needs to take if it wants Bonds held by it to be repurchased. If a Holder has so requested, and acted in accordance with the instructions in the notice from the Issuer, the Issuer, or a Person designated by the Issuer, shall repurchase the relevant Bonds and the repurchase amount shall fall due on the repurchase

The Issuer shall comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Bonds. To the extent that the provisions of such laws and regulations conflict with the provisions in this Clause 11.5, the Issuer shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Clause 11.5 by virtue of the conflict.

(b) the Issuer if the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments of the Group in a financial year (including the Restricted Payment in question but excluding any restricted payment in accordance with item (a) above) does not exceed fifty (50.00) per cent, of the Group's consolidated net profit (Sw. årets resultat) according to the annual audited financial statements for the previous financial year (and without accumulation of profits from previous financial years).

12.6

The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of the Subsidiaries, sell or otherwise dispose of shares in any Material Group Company or of all or substantially all of its or any Material Group Company's assets or operations to any Person not being the Issuer or any of the wholly-owned Subsidiaries, unless the transaction (taken as a whole also taking into account any transaction ancillary or related thereto) is carried out at fair market value and on terms and conditions customary for such transaction and provided that it does not have a Material Adverse Effect.

13.

TERMINATION OF THE BONDS

13.1

The Agent is entitled to, and shall following a demand in writing from a Holder (or Holders)

representing at least fifty (50) per cent, of the Adjusted Nominal Amount (such demand may

only be validly made by a person who is a Holder on the second Business Day following the

day on which the demand is received by the Agent and shall, if made by several Holders, be

made by them jointly) or following an instruction or decision pursuant to Clause 13.6 or

13.7, on behalf of the Holders, terminate the Bonds and to declare all, but not only some, of

the Bonds due for payment immediately or at such later date as the Agent determines (such

later date not falling later than twenty (20) Business Days from the date on which the Agent

made such declaration), if:

19

(a) Non-payment: The Issuer fails to pay an amount on the date it is due in accordance with these Terms and Conditions unless its failure to pay is due to an existence of an obstacle for the Issuer as set out in these Terms and Conditions or payment is made within five (5) Business Days of the due date;
(b) Other obligations: The Issuer does not comply with these Terms and Conditions in any other way than as set out under item (a) above, unless the non-compliance (i) is capable of being remedied and (ii) is remedied within fifteen (15) Business Days of the earlier of the Agent giving notice and the Issuer becoming aware of the noncompliance (if the failure or violation is not capable of being remedied, the Agent may declare the Bonds payable without such prior written request);
(c) Cross- acceleration:
(i) Any Financial Indebtedness of any Material Group Company is not paid when due nor within any originally applicable grace period, or is declared to be due and payable prior to its specified maturity as a result of an event of default however described under any document relating to Financial Indebtedness of any Material Group Company; or;
(ii) any security interest securing Financial Indebtedness over any asset of any Material Group Company is enforced;
provided however that the amount of Financial Indebtedness referred to under item (i) and/or (ii) above, individually or in the aggregate exceeds an amount corresponding to SEK 5,000,000 and provided that it does not apply to any Financial Indebtedness owed to a Group Company;
(d) Insolvency:
(i) Any Material Group Company is unable or admits inability to pay its debts as they fall due or is declared to be unable to pay its debts under applicable law, suspends making payments on its debts generally or, by reason of actual or anticipated financial difficulties, commences negotiations with its creditors (other than under these Terms and Conditions) with a view to rescheduling its Financial Indebtedness; or
(ii) a moratorium is declared in respect of the Financial Indebtedness of any Material Group Company;
(e) Insolvency proceedings: Any corporate action, legal proceedings or other procedures are taken (other than (i) proceedings or petitions which are being disputed in good faith and are discharged, stayed or dismissed within thirty (30) calendar days of commencement or, if earlier, the date on which it is advertised and (ii), in relation to the Subsidiaries, solvent liquidations) in relation to:
(i) the suspension of payments, winding-up, dissolution, administration or reorganisation (Sw. foretagsrekonstruktion) (by way of voluntary agreement, scheme of arrangement or otherwise) of any Material Group Company; 20

(ii) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of any Material Group Company or any of its assets; or

(iii) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction in respect of any Material Group Company;

(f) Mergers and demergers:

(i) A decision is made that any Material Group Company shall be merged or demerged into a company which is not a Group Company, unless the Agent has given its consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) in writing prior to the decision of the merger and/or demerger (where consent is not to be understood as a waiver of the rights that applicable law at the time assigns the concerned creditors); or

(ii) the Issuer merges with any other Person, or is subject to a demerger, with the effect that the Issuer is not the surviving entity;

(g) Creditors' process: Any expropriation, attachment, sequestration, distress or execution or any analogous process in any jurisdiction affects any asset or assets of any Material Group Company having an aggregate value equal to or exceeding SEK 5,000,000 and is not discharged within thirty (30) calendar days;

(h) Impossibility or illegality: It is or becomes impossible or unlawful for the Issuer to fulfil or perform any of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions or if the obligations under these Terms and Conditions are not, or cease to be, legal, valid, binding and enforceable; or

(i) Continuation of the business: The Issuer or any other Material Group Company ceases to carry on its business, except if due to (i) a permitted merger or demerger as stipulated in Clause 13.1 (f) (Mergers and demergers) or (ii) a permitted disposal as stipulated in Clause 12.6 (Disposals o f assets), provided it has a Material Adverse Effect.

13.2

The Agent may not terminate the Bonds in accordance with Clause 13.1 by reference to a

specific Event of Default if it is no longer continuing or if it has been decided, in accordance

with these Terms and Conditions, to waive such Event of Default (temporarily or

permanently). However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not

prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned under Clause

13.1 (d).

13.3

If the right to terminate the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government

authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the

period of appeal has expired in order for cause of termination to be deemed to exist.

13.4

The Issuer is obliged to inform the Agent immediately if any circumstance of the type

specified in Clause 13.1 should occur. Should the Agent not receive such information, the

Agent is entitled to assume that no such circumstance exists or can be expected to occur,

21

provided that the Agent does not have knowledge of such circumstance. The Agent is under no obligations to make any investigations relating to the circumstances specified in Clause 13.1. The Issuer shall further, at the request of the Agent, provide the Agent with details of any circumstances referred to in Clause 13.1 and provide the Agent with all documents that may be of significance for the application of this Clause 13.

13.5

The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Agent according to Clause 13.4 if informing the

Agent would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with Nasdaq

Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable). If such a conflict would exist

pursuant to the listing contract with Nasdaq Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as

applicable) or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek the approval from

Nasdaq Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) or undertake other

reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Agent, in

order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to Clause 13.4.

13.6

If the Agent has been notified by the Issuer or has otherwise determined that there is a

default under these Terms and Conditions according to Clause 13.1, the Agent shall (i)

notify, within five (5) Business Days of the day of notification or determination, the Holders

of the default and (ii) decide, within twenty (20) Business Days of the day of notification or

determination, if the Bonds shall be declared terminated. If the Agent has decided not to

terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that

there exists a right of termination and obtain instructions from the Holders according to the

provisions in Clause 15 {Decisions by Holders). If the Holders vote in favour of termination

and instruct the Agent to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds

terminated. However, if the cause for termination according to the Agent's appraisal has

ceased before the termination, the Agent shall not terminate the Bonds. The Agent shall in

such case, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that the cause for termination has

ceased. The Agent shall always be entitled to take the time necessary to consider whether an

occurred event constitutes an Event of Default.

13.7

If the Holders, without any prior initiative to decision from the Agent or the Issuer, have

made a decision regarding termination in accordance with Clause 15 {Decisions by Holders),

the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. The Agent is however not liable to

take action if the Agent considers cause for termination not to be at hand, unless the

instructing Holders agree in writing to indemnify and hold the Agent harmless from any loss

or liability and, if requested by the Agent in its discretion, grant sufficient security for such

indemnity.

13.8

If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in this

Clause 13, the Agent shall take every reasonable measure necessary to recover the amounts

outstanding under the Bonds.

13.9

For the avoidance of doubt, the Bonds cannot be terminated and become due for payment

prematurely according to this Clause 13 without relevant decision by the Agent or following

instructions from the Holders' pursuant to Clause 15 {Decisions by Holders).

22

13.10 14. 14.1
14.2 14.3 14.4

If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with this Clause 13, the Issuer shall redeem all Bonds with an amount per Bond equal to the applicable Call Option Amount.
DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS
If the Bonds have been declared due and payable in accordance with Clause 13 (Termination o f the Bonds), all payments by the Issuer relating to the Bonds shall be distributed in the following order of priority, in accordance with the instructions of the Agent:
(a) first, in or towards payment pro rata of (i) all unpaid fees, costs, expenses and indemnities payable by the Issuer to the Agent, (ii) other costs, expenses and indemnities relating to the termination of the Bonds or the protection of the Holders' rights, (iii) any non-reimbursed costs incurred by the Agent for external experts, and (iv) any non-reimbursed costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in relation to a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure;
(b) secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of accrued but unpaid Interest under the Bonds (Interest due on an earlier Interest Payment Date to be paid before any Interest due on a later Interest Payment Date);
(c) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid principal under the Bonds; and
(d) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under these Terms and Conditions.
Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer. The application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal.
If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in Clause 14.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way of a corresponding distribution in accordance with Clause 14.1.
Funds that the Agent receives (directly or indirectly) in connection with the termination of the Bonds constitute escrow funds according to the Escrow Funds Act and must be held on a separate interest-bearing account on behalf of the Holders and the other interested parties. The Agent shall arrange for payments of such funds in accordance with this Clause 14 as soon as reasonably practicable.
If the Issuer or the Agent shall make any payment under this Clause 14, the Issuer or the Agent, as applicable, shall notify the Holders of any such payment at least fifteen (15) Business Days before the payment is made. Such notice shall specify the Record Date, the payment date and the amount to be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any Interest due but unpaid the Record Date specified in Clause 9.1 shall apply.

23

15.

DECISIONS BY HOLDERS

A request by the Agent for a decision by the Holders on a matter relating to these Terms and

Conditions shall (at the option of the Agent) be dealt with at a Holders' Meeting or by way

of a Written Procedure.

15.2

Any request from the Issuer or a Holder (or Holders) representing at least ten (10) per cent,

of the Adjusted Nominal Amount (such request may only be validly made by a Person who

is a Holder on the Business Day immediately following the day on which the request is

received by the Agent and shall, if made by several Holders, be made by them jointly) for a

decision by the Holders on a matter relating to these Terms and Conditions shall be directed

to the Agent and dealt with at a Holders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure, as

determined by the Agent. The Person requesting the decision may suggest the form for

decision making, but if it is in the Agent's opinion more appropriate that a matter is dealt

with at a Holders' Meeting than by way of a Written Procedure, it shall be dealt with at a

Holders' Meeting.

15.3

The Agent may refrain from convening a Holders' Meeting or instigating a Written

Procedure if (i) the suggested decision must be approved by any Person in addition to the

Holders and such Person has informed the Agent that an approval will not be given, or (ii)

the suggested decision is not in accordance with applicable laws.

15.4

Only a Person who is, or who has been provided with a power of attorney or other proof of

authorisation pursuant to Clause 8 (Right to act on behalfo f a Holder) from a Person who is,

registered as a Holder:

(a) on the Record Date prior to the date of the Holders' Meeting, in respect of a Holders' Meeting, or

(b) on the Business Day specified in the communication pursuant to Clause 17.3, in respect of a Written Procedure,

may exercise voting rights as a Holder at such Holders' Meeting or in such Written Procedure, provided that the relevant Bonds are included in the definition of Adjusted Nominal Amount.

15.5

The matters set forth in items (a) and (b) below shall require consent of Holders representing

at least two thirds (2/3) (as regards the matters set forth in item (a)) or at least three quarters

Any matter not covered by Clause 15.5 shall require the consent of Holders representing more than fifty (50) per cent, of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Holders are voting at a Holders' Meeting or for which Holders reply in a Written Procedure in accordance with the instructions given pursuant to Clause 17.3. This includes, but is not limited to, any amendment to or waiver of these Terms and Conditions that does not require a higher majority (other than an amendment or waiver permitted pursuant to Clause 18.1 (a), (b) or (c)) or a termination of the Bonds.
If the number of votes or replies are equal, the opinion which is most beneficial for the Issuer, according to the chairman at a Holders' Meeting or the Agent in a Written Procedure, will prevail. The chairman at a Holders' Meeting shall be appointed by the Holders in accordance with Clause 15.6.
Quorum at a Holders' Meeting or in respect of a Written Procedure only exists if a Holder (or Holders) representing at least twenty (20) per cent, (or fifty (50) per cent., if the Holders' Meeting or the Written Procedure shall consider a matter set forth in Clause 15.5 (a) or (b)) of the Adjusted Nominal Amount:

The quorum requirement in Clause 15.8 shall not apply to such second Holders' Meeting or Written Procedure.
Any decision which extends or increases the obligations of the Issuer or the Agent, or limits, reduces or extinguishes the rights or benefits of the Issuer or the Agent, under these Terms and Conditions shall be subject to the Issuer's or the Agent's consent, as appropriate.
A Holder holding more than one Bond need not use all its votes or cast all the votes to which it is entitled in the same way and may in its discretion use or cast some of its votes only.
The Issuer may not, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder for or as inducement to any consent under these Terms and Conditions, unless such consideration is offered to all Holders that consent at the relevant Holders' Meeting or in a Written Procedure within the time period stipulated for the consideration to be payable or the time period for replies in the Written Procedure, as the case may be.
A matter decided at a duly convened and held Holders' Meeting or by way of Written Procedure is binding on all Holders, irrespective of them being present or represented at the Holders' Meeting or responding in the Written Procedure.

All costs and expenses incurred by the Issuer or the Agent for the purpose of convening a Holders' Meeting or for the purpose of carrying out a Written Procedure, including reasonable fees to the Agent, shall be paid by the Issuer.
If a decision shall be taken by the Holders on a matter relating to these Terms and Conditions, the Issuer shall promptly at the request of the Agent provide the Agent with a certificate specifying the number of Bonds owned by Group Companies or (to the knowledge of the Issuer) their Affiliates, irrespective of whether such Person is directly registered as owner of such Bonds.

Information about decisions taken at a Holders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure shall promptly be sent by notice to the Holders and published on the websites of the Issuer and the Agent, provided that a failure to do so shall not invalidate any decision made or voting result achieved. The minutes from the relevant Holders' Meeting or Written Procedure shall at the request of a Holder be sent to it by the Issuer or the Agent, as applicable.
HOLDERS' MEETING
The Agent shall convene a Holders' Meeting by sending a notice thereof to each Holder no later than five (5) Business Days after receipt of a request from the Issuer or the Holder(s) (or such later date as may be necessary for technical or administrative reasons). If the Holders' Meeting has been requested by the Holder(s), the Agent shall send a copy of the notice to the Issuer.
Should the Issuer want to replace the Agent, it may convene a Holders' Meeting in accordance with Clause 16.1 with a copy to the Agent.

The notice pursuant to Clause 16.1 shall include (i) time for the meeting, (ii) place for the meeting, (iii) agenda for the meeting (including each request for a decision by the Holders) and (iv) a form of power of attorney. Only matters that have been included in the notice may be resolved upon at the Holders' Meeting. Should prior notification by the Holders be required in order to attend the Holders' Meeting, such requirement shall be included in the notice.
The Holders' Meeting shall be held no earlier than ten (10) Business Days and no later than twenty (20) Business Days from the notice.
If the Agent, in breach of these Terms and Conditions, has not convened a Holders' Meeting within five (5) Business Days after having received such notice, the requesting Person may convene the Holders' Meeting itself. If the requesting Person is a Holder, the Issuer shall upon request from such Holder provide the Holder with necessary information from the
26

register kept by the CSD and, if no Person to open the Holders' Meeting has been appointed by the Agent, the meeting shall be opened by a Person appointed by the requesting Person.
At a Holders' Meeting, the Issuer, the Holders (or the Holders' representatives/proxies) and the Agent may attend along with each of their representatives, counsels and assistants. Further, the directors of the board, the managing director and other officials of the Issuer and the Issuer's auditors may attend the Holders' Meeting. The Holders' Meeting may decide that further individuals may attend. If a representative/proxy shall attend the Holders' Meeting instead of the Holder, the representative/proxy shall present a duly executed proxy or other document establishing its authority to represent the Holder.
Without amending or varying these Terms and Conditions, the Agent may prescribe such further regulations regarding the convening and holding of a Holders' Meeting as the Agent may deem appropriate. Such regulations may include a possibility for Holders to vote without attending the meeting in person.
WRITTEN PROCEDURE
The Agent shall instigate a Written Procedure no later than five (5) Business Days after receipt of a request from the Issuer or the Holder(s) (or such later date as may be necessary for technical or administrative reasons) by sending a communication to each such Person who is registered as a Holder on the Business Day prior to the date on which the communication is sent. If the Written Procedure has been requested by the Holder(s), the Agent shall send a copy of the communication to the Issuer.
Should the Issuer want to replace the Agent, it may send a communication in accordance with Clause 17.1 to each Holder with a copy to the Agent.
A communication pursuant to Clause 17.1 shall include (i) each request for a decision by the Holders, (ii) a description of the reasons for each request, (iii) a specification of the Business Day on which a Person must be registered as a Holder in order to be entitled to exercise voting rights (such Business Day not to fall earlier than the effective date of the communication pursuant to Clause 17.1), (iv) instructions and directions on where to receive a form for replying to the request (such form to include an option to vote yes or no for each request) as well as a form of power of attorney, and (v) the stipulated time period within which the Holder must reply to the request (such time period to last at least ten (10) Business Days but not more than twenty (20) Business Days from the communication pursuant to Clause 17.1). If the voting shall be made electronically, instructions for such voting shall be included in the communication.
If the Agent, in breach of these Terms and Conditions, has not instigated a Written Procedure within five (5) Business Days after having received such notice, the requesting Person may instigate a Written Procedure itself. If the requesting Person is a Holder, the Issuer shall upon request from such Holder provide the Holder with necessary information from the register kept by the CSD.
When the requisite majority consents of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount pursuant to Clause 15.5 and 15.6 have been received in a Written Procedure, the relevant decision shall

AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS
The Issuer and the Agent (acting on behalf of the Holders) may agree to amend these Terms and Conditions or waive any provision in these Terms and Conditions, provided that:
(a) such amendment or waiver is not detrimental to the interest of the Holders, or is made solely for the purpose of rectifying obvious errors and mistakes;
(b) such amendment or waiver is required by applicable law, a court ruling or a decision by a relevant authority;
(c) such amendment or waiver is necessary for the purpose of listing the Bonds on the corporate bond list of Nasdaq Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) provided such amendment or waiver does not materially adversely affect the rights of the Holders; or
(d) such amendment or waiver has been duly approved by the Holders in accordance with Clause 15 {Decisions by Holders).
The consent of the Holders is not necessary to approve the particular form of any amendment or waiver to these Terms and Conditions. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the amendment or waiver.
The Agent shall promptly notify the Holders of any amendments or waivers made in accordance with Clause 18.1, setting out the date from which the amendment or waiver will be effective, and ensure that any amendments to these Terms and Conditions are available on the websites of the Issuer and the Agent. The Issuer shall ensure that any amendments to these Terms and Conditions are duly registered with the CSD and each other relevant organisation or authority.
An amendment or waiver to these Terms and Conditions shall take effect on the date determined by the Holders' Meeting, in the Written Procedure or by the Agent, as the case may be.
APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THE AGENT
Appointment of Agent
By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Holder appoints the Agent to act as its agent in all matters relating to the Bonds and these Terms and Conditions, and authorises the Agent to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent, unless such consent is specifically required by these Terms and Conditions) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Bonds held by such Holder, including the winding-up, dissolution, liquidation, company reorganisation (Sw.foretagsrekonstruktion) or bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction) of the Issuer. By acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Holder confirms such appointment and authorisation for the Agent to act on its behalf.

Each Holder shall immediately upon request by the Agent provide the Agent with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent), as the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under these Terms and Conditions. The Agent is under no obligation to represent a Holder which does not comply with such request.
The Issuer shall promptly upon request provide the Agent with any documents and other assistance (in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent), that the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under these Terms and Conditions.
The Agent is entitled to fees for its work and to be indemnified for costs, losses and liabilities on the terms set out in these Terms and Conditions and the Agent Agreement, and the Agent's obligations as agent under these Terms and Conditions are conditioned upon the due payment of such fees and indemnifications.
The Agent may act as agent for several issues of securities issued by or relating to the Issuer and other Group Companies notwithstanding potential conflicts of interest.
Duties of the Agent
The Agent shall represent the Holders in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. However, the Agent is not responsible for the execution or enforceability of these Terms and Conditions. The Agent shall keep the latest version of these Terms and Conditions (including any document amending these Terms and Conditions) available on the website of the Agent.
Upon request by a Holder, the Agent shall promptly distribute to the Holders any information from such Holder which relates to the Bonds (at the discretion of the Agent). The Agent may require that the requesting Holder reimburses any costs or expenses incurred, or to be incurred, by the Agent in doing so (including a reasonable fee for the work of the Agent) before any such information is distributed. The Agent shall upon request by a Holder disclose the identity of any other Holder who has consented to the Agent in doing so.
When acting in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, the Agent is always acting with binding effect on behalf of the Holders. The Agent shall carry out its duties under these Terms and Conditions in a reasonable, proficient and professional manner, with reasonable care and skill.
The Agent is entitled to delegate its duties to other professional parties, but the Agent shall remain liable for the actions of such parties under these Terms and Conditions.

The Agent shall be entitled to disclose to the Holders any event or circumstance directly or indirectly relating to the Issuer or the Bonds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agent may if it considers it to be beneficial to the interests of the Holders delay disclosure or refrain from disclosing certain information other than in respect of an Event of Default that has occurred and is continuing.
The Agent is entitled to engage external experts when carrying out its duties under these Terms and Conditions. The Issuer shall on demand by the Agent pay all costs for external experts engaged (i) after the occurrence of an Event of Default, (ii) for the purpose of investigating or considering an event which the Agent reasonably believes is or may lead to an Event of Default or a matter relating to the Issuer which the Agent reasonably believes may be detrimental to the interests of the Holders under these Terms and Conditions or (iii) when the Agent is to make a determination under these Terms and Conditions. Any compensation for damages or other recoveries received by the Agent from external experts engaged by it for the purpose of carrying out its duties under these Terms and Conditions shall be distributed in accordance with Clause 14 {Distribution o fproceeds).
The Agent shall enter into agreements with the CSD, and comply with such agreement and the CSD regulations applicable to the Agent, as may be necessary in order for the Agent to carry out its duties under these Terms and Conditions.
Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms and Conditions to the contrary, the Agent is not obliged to do or omit to do anything if it would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of any law or regulation.
If in the Agent's reasonable opinion the cost, loss or liability which it may incur (including reasonable fees to the Agent) in complying with instructions of the Holders, or taking any action at its own initiative, will not be covered by the Issuer, the Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with such instructions, or taking such action, until it has received such funding or indemnities (or adequate security has been provided therefore) as it may reasonably require.
The Agent shall give a notice to the Holders (i) before it ceases to perform its obligations under these Terms and Conditions by reason of the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under these Terms and Conditions or the Agent Agreement, or (ii) if it refrains from acting for any reason described in Clause 19.2.10.

detrimental to the interests of the Holders to delay the action in order to first obtain instructions from the Holders.
The Agent shall not be liable for any delay (or any related consequences) in crediting an account with an amount required pursuant to these Terms and Conditions to be paid by the Agent to the Holders, provided that the Agent has taken all necessary steps as soon as reasonably practicable to comply with the regulations or operating procedures of any recognised clearing or settlement system used by the Agent for that purpose.

Subject to Clause 19.4.6, the Agent may resign by giving notice to the Issuer and the Holders, in which case the Holders shall appoint a successor Agent at a Holders' Meeting convened by the retiring Agent or by way of Written Procedure initiated by the retiring Agent.
Subject to Clause 19.4.6, if the Agent is insolvent, the Agent shall be deemed to resign as Agent and the Issuer shall within ten (10) Business Days appoint a successor Agent which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable company which regularly acts as agent under debt issuances.
A Holder (or Holders) representing at least ten (10) per cent, of the Adjusted Nominal Amount may, by notice to the Issuer (such notice may only be validly given by a Person who is a Holder on the Business Day immediately following the day on which the notice is received by the Issuer and shall, if given by several Holders, be given by them jointly), require that a Holders' Meeting is held for the purpose of dismissing the Agent and appointing a new Agent. The Issuer may, at a Holders' Meeting convened by it or by way of Written Procedure initiated by it, propose to the Holders that the Agent be dismissed and a new Agent appointed.
If the Holders have not appointed a successor Agent within ninety (90) calendar days after (i) the earlier of the notice of resignation was given or the resignation otherwise took place or (ii) the Agent was dismissed through a decision by the Holders, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Agent which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable company which regularly acts as agent under debt issuances.
The retiring Agent shall, at its own cost, make available to the successor Agent such documents and records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent under these Terms and Conditions.

Upon the appointment of a successor, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of these Terms and Conditions but shall remain entitled to the benefit of these Terms and Conditions and remain liable under these Terms and Conditions in respect of any action which it took or failed to take whilst acting as Agent. Its successor, the Issuer and each of the Holders shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves under these Terms and Conditions as they would have had if such successor had been the original Agent.
In the event that there is a change of the Agent in accordance with this Clause 19.4, the Issuer shall execute such documents and take such actions as the new Agent may reasonably require for the purpose of vesting in such new Agent the rights, powers and obligation of the Agent and releasing the retiring Agent from its further obligations under these Terms and Conditions and the Agent Agreement. Unless the Issuer and the new Agent agrees otherwise, the new Agent shall be entitled to the same fees and the same indemnities as the retiring Agent.
APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THE ISSUING AGENT
The Issuer appoints the Issuing Agent to manage certain specified tasks under these Terms and Conditions and in accordance with the legislation, rules and regulations applicable to and/or issued by the CSD and relating to the Bonds.
The Issuing Agent may retire from its assignment or be dismissed by the Issuer, provided that the Issuer has approved that a commercial bank or securities institution approved by the CSD accedes as new Issuing Agent at the same time as the old Issuing Agent retires or is dismissed. If the Issuing Agent is insolvent, the Issuer shall immediately appoint a new Issuing Agent, which shall replace the old Issuing Agent as issuing agent in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.
APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THE CSD
The Issuer has appointed the CSD to manage certain tasks under these Terms and Conditions and in accordance with the legislation, rules and regulations applicable to the CSD.
The CSD may retire from its assignment or be dismissed by the Issuer, provided that the Issuer has effectively appointed a replacement CSD that accedes as CSD at the same time as the old CSD retires or is dismissed and provided also that the replacement does not have a negative effect on any Holder or the listing of the Bonds listed on the corporate bond list of Nasdaq Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market). The replacing CSD must be authorised to professionally conduct clearing operations pursuant to the Securities Market Act.
NO DIRECT ACTIONS BY HOLDERS
A Holder may not take any steps whatsoever against the Issuer or a Subsidiary to enforce or recover any amount due or owing to it pursuant to these Terms and Conditions, or to initiate,

support or procure the winding-up, dissolution, liquidation, company reorganisation (Sw. foretagsrekonstruktion) or bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction) of the Issuer or a Subsidiary in relation to any of the liabilities of the Issuer under these Terms and Conditions. Such steps may only be taken by the Agent.
Clause 22.1 shall not apply if the Agent has been instructed by the Holders in accordance with these Terms and Conditions to take certain actions but fails for any reason to take, or is unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a Holder to provide documents in accordance with Clause 19.1.2), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under these Terms and Conditions or the Agent Agreement or by any reason described in Clause 19.2.10, such failure must continue for at least forty (40) Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 19.2.11 before a Holder may take any action referred to in Clause 22.1.
The provisions of Clause 22.1 shall not in any way limit an individual Holder's right to claim and enforce payments which are due to it under Clause 11.5 (Mandatory repurchase due to a Change o f Control Event, a De-listing Event or a Listing Failure (put option)) or other payments which are due by the Issuer to some but not all Holders.
TIME-BAR
The right to receive repayment of the principal of the Bonds shall be time-barred and become void ten (10) years from the relevant Redemption Date. The right to receive payment of Interest (excluding any capitalised Interest) shall be time-barred and become void three (3) years from the relevant due date for payment. The Issuer is entitled to any funds set aside for payments in respect of which the Holders' right to receive payment has been time-barred and has become void.
If a limitation period is duly interrupted in accordance with the Swedish Act on Limitations (Sw. preskriptionslag (1981:130)), a new time-bar period of ten (10) years with respect to the right to receive repayment of the principal of the Bonds, and of three (3) years with respect to the right to receive payment of Interest (excluding capitalised Interest) will commence, in both cases calculated from the date of interruption of the time-bar period, as such date isdetermined pursuant to the provisions of the Swedish Act on Limitations.

FORCE MAJEURE AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Neither the Agent nor the Issuing Agent shall be held responsible for any damage arising out of any legal enactment, or any measure taken by a public authority, or war, strike, lockout, boycott, blockade or any other similar circumstance (a "Force Majeure Event").
