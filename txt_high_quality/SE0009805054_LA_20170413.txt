to receive such amount.

The Issuer shall pay any stamp duty and other public fees accruing in connection with the

applicable withholding tax payable pursuant to law. The Issuer shall not be liable to

reimburse any stamp duty or public fee or to gross-up any payments under these Terms and

Conditions by virtue of any withholding tax.

9.

INTEREST

9.1

The Bonds will bear Interest at the Interest Rate applied to the Nominal Amount from, but

excluding, the Issue Date up to and including the relevant Redemption Date. Any

Subsequent Bond will, however, carry Interest at the Interest Rate from, but excluding, the

Interest Payment Date falling immediately prior to its issuance up to and including the

relevant Redemption Date.

9.2

For the avoidance of doubt, Interest shall never be calculated as being an amount less than

zero (0).

9.3

Interest accrues during an Interest Period. Payment of Interest in respect of the Bonds shall

be made quarterly in arrears to the Holders on each Interest Payment Date for the preceding

Interest Period.

9.4

Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the Interest Period in

respect of which payment is being made divided by 360 (actual/360-days basis).

9.5

If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it under these Terms and Conditions on its

due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from, but excluding, the due

10. 10.1
10.2
10.3 10.3.1
10.3.2 10.4 10.4.1

date up to and including the date of actual payment at a rate which is 200 basis points higher than the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Agent or the CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
REDEMPTION AND REPURCHASE OF THE BONDS
Redemption at maturity
The Issuer shall redeem all, but not only some, of the Bonds in full on the Final Redemption Date (or, to the extent such day is not a Business Day and if permitted under the CSD's applicable regulations, on the Business Day following from an application of the Business Day Convention, and otherwise on the first following Business Day) with an amount per Bond equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
The Group Companies' purchase of Bonds
For as long as any Existing Bonds remain outstanding no Group Company may purchase Bonds except if the Issuer has an obligation to do so pursuant to these Terms and Conditions. Once no Existing Bonds remain outstanding each Group Company may, subject to applicable law, at any time and at any price purchase Bonds. Bonds held by a Group Company may at such Group Company's discretion be retained or sold, but not cancelled, except in connection with a full redemption of the Bonds.
Early voluntary redemption by the Issuer (call option)
The Issuer may redeem all, but not only some, of the Bonds in full on any Business Day falling:
(a) on or after the date falling twelve (12) months before the Final Redemption Date, at a price equal to one hundred and one (101.00) per cent. of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest; or
(b) on or after the date falling ninety (90) days before the Final Redemption Date, at a price equal to one hundred (100.00) per cent. of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest, provided that such early redemption is financed in full by way of the Issuer issuing Market Loan(s).
Redemption in accordance with Clause 10.3.1shall be made by the Issuer giving not less than fifteen (15) Business Days' notice to the Holders and the Agent. Any such notice shall state the Redemption Date and the relevant Record Date and is irrevocable but may, at the Issuer's discretion, contain one or more conditions precedent. Upon expiry of such notice and the fulfilment of the conditions precedent (if any), the Issuer is bound to redeem the Bonds in full at the applicable amounts.
Mandatory repurchase due to a Change of Control Event, De-listing Event or Listing Failure (put option)
Upon a Change of Control Event, a De-listing Event or a Listing Failure occurring, each Holder shall have the right to request that all, but not only some, of its Bonds are
13

10.4.2
10.4.3 10.4.4 10.4.5
11. 11.1

repurchased (whereby the Issuer shall have the obligation to repurchase such Bonds) at a price per Bond equal to one hundred and one (101.00) per cent. of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest during a period of thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of a notice from the Issuer of the relevant event pursuant to Clause 11.11.1 (e). The thirty (30) calendar days' period may not start earlier than upon the occurrence of the Change of Control Event, the De-listing Event or Listing Failure.
The notice from the Issuer pursuant to Clause 11.11.1 (e) shall specify the repurchase date and include instructions about the actions that a Holder needs to take if it wants Bonds held by it to be repurchased. If a Holder has so requested, and acted in accordance with the instructions in the notice from the Issuer, the Issuer, or a Person designated by the Issuer, shall repurchase the relevant Bonds and the repurchase amount shall fall due on the repurchase date specified in the notice given by the Issuer pursuant to Clause 11.11.1 (e). The repurchase date must fall no later than twenty (20) Business Days after the end of the period referred to in Clause 10.4.1.
The Issuer shall comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Bonds. To the extent that the provisions of such laws and regulations conflict with the provisions in this Clause 10.4, the Issuer shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Clause 10.4 by virtue of the conflict.
Any Bonds repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to this Clause 10.4 may at the Issuer's discretion be disposed of in accordance with Clause 10.2 (The Group Companies'purchase o fBonds).
The Issuer shall not be required to repurchase any Bonds pursuant to this Clause 10.4, if a third party in connection with the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, De-listing Event or Listing Failure, as applicable, offers to purchase the Bonds in the manner and on the terms set out in this Clause 10.4 (or on terms more favourable to the Holders) and purchases all Bonds validly tendered in accordance with such offer. If the Bonds tendered are not purchased within the time limits stipulated in this Clause 10.4, the Issuer shall repurchase any such Notes within five (5) Business Days after the expiry of the time limit.
SPECIAL UNDERTAKINGS
So long as any Bond remains outstanding, the Issuer undertakes to comply with the special undertakings set forth in this Clause 11.
Distributions
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of the Subsidiaries, (i) pay any dividend on shares, (ii) repurchase any of its own shares, (iii) redeem its share capital or other restricted equity with repayment to shareholders, (iv) repay principal or pay interest under any shareholder loans or (v) make any other similar distributions or transfers of value (Sw. värdeöverföringar) to the Issuer's or the Subsidiaries' direct and indirect shareholders or the Affiliates of such direct and indirect shareholders (items (i)-(v) above are together and individually referred to as a "Restricted Payment"), provided however that any such
14

11.2
11.3 11.4 11.5 11.5.1

Restricted Payment can be made, if such Restricted Payment is permitted by law and no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such Restricted Payment, by:
(a) any Group Company if such Restricted Payment is made to a Group Company and, if made by a Subsidiary which is not directly or indirectly wholly-owned by the Issuer, is made on a pro rata basis;
(b) any Group Company if such Restricted Payment constitutes a payment under a Synthetic Employee Option;
(c) the Issuer, in respect of dividend on Preference Shares; or
(d) the Issuer, provided that the Incurrence Test is met (calculated on a pro forma basis including the Restricted Payment in question and any dividends on Preference Shares resolved upon but not yet paid out).
Listing of Bonds
The Issuer shall ensure:
(a) that the Bonds issued under the Initial Bond Issue are listed on the corporate bond list of Nasdaq Stockholm or, if such admission to trading is not possible to obtain or maintain, admitted to trading on another Regulated Market within twelve (12) months after the First Issue Date;
(b) that the Bonds, once admitted to trading on the relevant Regulated Market, continue being listed thereon (however, taking into account the rules and regulations of the relevant Regulated Market and the CSD (as amended from time to time) preventing trading in the Bonds in close connection to the redemption of the Bonds); and
(c) that, upon any Subsequent Bond Issue, the volume of Bonds listed on the relevant Regulated Market promptly, and not later than ten (10) Business Days after the relevant Issue Date, is increased accordingly.

Market Loans
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of the Subsidiaries, (i) issue any Market Loan that has a final redemption date or, when applicable, early redemption dates or instalment dates which occur before the Final Redemption Date (for the avoidance of doubt, this does not apply to bonds constituting Existing Bonds), or (ii) repurchase any Market Loan as long as Existing Bonds are outstanding (except if the Issuer has an obligation to do so pursuant to these Terms and Conditions).
Maintenance Test
The Issuer shall ensure that the Maintenance Test is met as long as any Bond is outstanding.

11.6.2 11.7
11.8
11.9 11.10

Property valuations
The Issuer shall, during each period of two (2) consecutive Relevant Periods whereof the first period commences on the First Issue Date, procure that an external valuation report regarding the fair value of at least ninety (90.00) per cent. of the properties (land and buildings) held by the Group is prepared by a reputable independent property advisor, such as Newsec Advice AB, Forum Fastighetsekonomi AB, NAI Svefa, DTZ, Savills, CBRE or any other reputable independent property advisor approved by the Agent.
The Issuer shall further procure that the results of such valuation report as described in Clause 11.6.1, or (if available) any subsequent comparable valuation report(s) replacing such valuation report(s), are reflected in good faith and in accordance with the Group's valuation policy in the following Financial Report(s).
Maintenance of Properties
The Issuer shall, and shall procure that each Group Company will, keep the properties held by the Group in a good state of repair and maintenance subject to normal wear and tear and in accordance with normal market practice, and in such repair and condition as will enable the Issuer and each Group Company owning properties to comply in all material respects with the obligations under relevant rental agreements and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.
Disposals of assets
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of the Subsidiaries, sell or otherwise dispose of shares in any Group Company or of all or substantially all of its or any Group Company's assets or operations to any Person not being the Issuer or any of the wholly-owned Subsidiaries, unless the transaction (taken as a whole also taking into account any transaction ancillary or related thereto) is carried out at fair market value and on terms and conditions customary for such transaction and provided that the transaction does not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Issuer shall notify the Agent of any such transaction and, upon request by the Agent, provide the Agent with any information relating to the transaction which the Agent deems necessary (acting reasonably).
Dealings with related parties
The Issuer shall, and shall procure that the Subsidiaries, conduct all dealings with the direct and indirect shareholders of the Group Companies (excluding when such shareholder is another Group Company) and/or any Affiliates of such direct and indirect shareholders at arm's length terms.

12.

TERMINATION OF THE BONDS

12.1

The Agent is entitled to, and shall following a demand in writing from a Holder (or Holders)

representing at least fifty (50.00) per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount (such demand

may only be validly made by a person who is a Holder on the second Business Day

following the day on which the demand is received by the Agent and shall, if made by

18

several Holders, be made by them jointly) or following an instruction or decision pursuant to Clause 12.6 or 12.7, on behalf of the Holders, terminate the Bonds and to declare all, but not only some, of the Bonds due for payment immediately or at such later date as the Agent determines (such later date not falling later than twenty (20) Business Days from the date on which the Agent made such declaration), if:
(a) Non-payment: The Issuer fails to pay an amount on the date it is due in accordance with these Terms and Conditions unless its failure to pay is due to technical or administrative error and is remedied within five (5) Business Days of the due date;
(b) Other obligations: The Issuer does not comply with these Terms and Conditions in any other way than as set out under item (a) above, unless the non-compliance is (i) capable of being remedied and (ii) remedied within fifteen (15) Business Days of the earlier of the Agent giving notice and the Issuer becoming aware of the non compliance (if the failure or violation is not capable of being remedied, the Agent may declare the Bonds payable without such prior written request);
(c) Cross- acceleration:
(i) Any Financial Indebtedness of any Material Group Company is not paid when due nor within any originally applicable grace period or is declared to be or otherwise becomes due and payable prior to its specified maturity as a result of an event of default howsoever described under any document relating to Financial Indebtedness of any Material Group Company; or
(ii) any security interest securing Financial Indebtedness over any asset of any Material Group Company is enforced,
provided however that the amount of Financial Indebtedness referred to under item (i) and/or (ii) above, individually or in the aggregate exceeds an amount corresponding to SEK 15,000,000 and provided that it does not apply to any Financial Indebtedness owed to a Group Company;
(d) Insolvency:
(i) Any Material Group Company is unable or admits inability to pay its debts as they fall due or is declared to be unable to pay its debts under applicable law, suspends making payments on its debts generally or, by reason of actual or anticipated financial difficulties, commences negotiations with its creditors (other than under these Terms and Conditions) with a view to rescheduling its Financial Indebtedness; or
(ii) a moratorium is declared in respect of the Financial Indebtedness of any Material Group Company;
(e) Insolvency proceedings: Any corporate action, legal proceedings or other procedures are taken (other than (i) proceedings or petitions which are being disputed in good faith and are discharged, stayed or dismissed within thirty (30)
19

calendar days of commencement or, if earlier, the date on which it is advertised and (ii), in relation to the Subsidiaries, solvent liquidations) in relation to:

(i) the suspension of payments, winding-up, dissolution, administration or reorganisation (Sw. foretagsrekonstruktion) (by way of voluntary agreement, scheme of arrangement or otherwise) of any Material Group Company;

(ii) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of any Material Group Company or any of its assets; or

(iii) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction in respect of any Material Group Company;

(f) Mergers and demergers:

(i) A decision is made that any Material Group Company shall be merged or demerged into a company which is not a Group Company, unless the Agent has given its consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) in writing prior to the merger and/or demerger (where consent is not to be understood as a waiver of the rights that applicable law at the time assigns the concerned creditors); or

(ii) the Issuer merges with any other Person, or is subject to a demerger, with the effect that the Issuer is not the surviving entity;

(g) Creditors' process: Any expropriation, attachment, sequestration, distress or execution or any analogous process in any jurisdiction affects any asset or assets of any Material Group Company having an aggregate value equal to or exceeding SEK 15,000,000 and is not discharged within thirty (30) calendar days;

(h) Impossibility or illegality: It is or becomes impossible or unlawful for the Issuer to fulfil or perform any of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions or if the obligations under these Terms and Conditions are not, or cease to be, legal, valid, binding and enforceable; or

(i) Continuation of the business: The Issuer or any other Material Group Company ceases to carry on its business, except if due to (i) a permitted merger or demerger as stipulated in paragraph (f) (Mergers and demergers) above, or (ii) a permitted disposal as stipulated in Clause 11.8 (Disposals o fassets).

12.2

The Agent may not terminate the Bonds in accordance with Clause 12.1 by reference to a

specific Event of Default if it is no longer continuing or if it has been decided, in accordance

with these Terms and Conditions, to waive such Event of Default (temporarily or

permanently). However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not

prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned under Clause 12.1 (d)

(Insolvency).

20

12.3

If the right to terminate the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government

authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the

period of appeal has expired in order for cause of termination to be deemed to exist.

12.4

The Issuer is obliged to inform the Agent immediately if any circumstance of the type

specified in Clause 12.1 should occur. Should the Agent not receive such information, the

Agent is entitled to assume that no such circumstance exists or can be expected to occur,

provided that the Agent does not have knowledge of such circumstance. The Agent is under

no obligations to make any investigations relating to the circumstances specified in

Clause 12.1. The Issuer shall further, at the request of the Agent, provide the Agent with

details of any circumstances referred to in Clause 12.1 and provide the Agent with all

documents that may be of significance for the application of this Clause 12.

12.5

The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Agent according to Clause 12.4 if informing the

Agent would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with Nasdaq

Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable). If such a conflict would exist

pursuant to the listing contract with Nasdaq Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as

applicable) or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek the approval from

Nasdaq Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) or undertake other

reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Agent, in

order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to Clause 12.4.

12.6

If the Agent has been notified by the Issuer or has otherwise determined that there is a

default under these Terms and Conditions according to Clause 12.1, the Agent shall (i)

notify, within five (5) Business Days of the day of notification or determination, the Holders

of the default and (ii) decide, within twenty (20) Business Days of the day of notification or

determination, if the Bonds shall be declared terminated. If the Agent has decided not to

terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that

there exists a right of termination and obtain instructions from the Holders according to the

provisions in Clause 14 (Decisions by Holders). If the Holders vote in favour of termination

and instruct the Agent to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds

terminated. However, if the cause for termination according to the Agent's appraisal has

ceased before the termination, the Agent shall not terminate the Bonds. The Agent shall in

such case, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that the cause for termination has

ceased. The Agent shall always be entitled to take the time necessary to consider whether an

occurred event constitutes an Event of Default.

12.7

If the Holders, without any prior initiative to decision from the Agent or the Issuer, have

made a decision regarding termination in accordance with Clause 14 (Decisions by Holders),

the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. The Agent is however not liable to

take action if the Agent considers cause for termination not to be at hand, unless the

instructing Holders agree in writing to indemnify and hold the Agent harmless from any loss

or liability and, if requested by the Agent in its discretion, grant sufficient security for such

indemnity.

21

12.8 12.9 12.10 13. 13.1
13.2 13.3

If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in this Clause 12, the Agent shall take every reasonable measure necessary to recover the amounts outstanding under the Bonds.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Bonds cannot be terminated and become due for payment prematurely according to this Clause 12 without relevant decision by the Agent or following instructions from the Holders' pursuant to Clause 14 (Decisions by Holders).
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with this Clause 12, the Issuer shall redeem all Bonds with an amount per Bond equal to one hundred and one (101.00) per cent. of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS
If the Bonds have been declared due and payable in accordance with Clause 12 (Termination o f the Bonds), all payments by the Issuer relating to the Bonds shall be distributed in the following order of priority, in accordance with the instructions of the Agent:
(a) first, in or towards payment pro rata of (i) all unpaid fees, costs, expenses and indemnities payable by the Issuer to the Agent, (ii) other costs, expenses and indemnities relating to the termination of the Bonds or the protection of the Holders' rights, (iii) any non-reimbursed costs incurred by the Agent for external experts, and (iv) any non-reimbursed costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in relation to a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure;
(b) secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of accrued but unpaid Interest under the Bonds (Interest due on an earlier Interest Payment Date to be paid before any Interest due on a later Interest Payment Date);
(c) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid principal under the Bonds; and
(d) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under these Terms and Conditions.
Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with items (a) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer. The application of proceeds in accordance with items (a) to (d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal.
If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in Clause 13.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way of a corresponding distribution in accordance with Clause 13.1.
Funds that the Agent receives (directly or indirectly) in connection with the termination of the Bonds constitute escrow funds (Sw. redovisningsmedel) according to the Escrow Funds Act (Sw. lag (1944:181) om redovisningsmedel) and must be held on a separate interest bearing account on behalf of the Holders and the other interested parties. The Agent shall

22

arrange for payments of such funds in accordance with this Clause 13 as soon as reasonably practicable.

13.4

If the Issuer or the Agent shall make any payment under this Clause 13, the Issuer or the

Agent, as applicable, shall notify the Holders of any such payment at least fifteen (15)

Business Days before the payment is made. Such notice shall specify the Record Date, the

payment date and the amount to be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any Interest due

but unpaid the Record Date specified in Clause 8.1 shall apply.

14.

DECISIONS BY HOLDERS

14.1

A request by the Agent for a decision by the Holders on a matter relating to these Terms and

Conditions shall (at the option of the Agent) be dealt with at a Holders' Meeting or by way

of a Written Procedure.

14.2

Any request from the Issuer or a Holder (or Holders) representing at least ten (10.00)

per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount (such request may only be validly made by a

Person who is a Holder on the Business Day immediately following the day on which the

request is received by the Agent and shall, if made by several Holders, be made by them

jointly) for a decision by the Holders on a matter relating to these Terms and Conditions

shall be directed to the Agent and dealt with at a Holders' Meeting or by way of a Written

Procedure, as determined by the Agent. The Person requesting the decision may suggest the

form for decision making, but if it is in the Agent's opinion more appropriate that a matter is

dealt with at a Holders' Meeting than by way of a Written Procedure, it shall be dealt with at

a Holders' Meeting.

14.3

The Agent may refrain from convening a Holders' Meeting or instigating a Written

Procedure if (i) the suggested decision must be approved by any Person in addition to the

Holders and such Person has informed the Agent that an approval will not be given, or (ii)

the suggested decision is not in accordance with applicable laws.

14.4

Only a Person who is, or who has been provided with a power of attorney or other proof of

authorisation pursuant to Clause 7 (Right to act on behalfo f a Holder) from a Person who is,

registered as a Holder:

(a) on the Record Date prior to the date of the Holders' Meeting, in respect of a Holders' Meeting, or

(b) on the Business Day specified in the communication pursuant to Clause 16.3, in respect of a Written Procedure,

may exercise voting rights as a Holder at such Holders' Meeting or in such Written Procedure, provided that the relevant Bonds are included in the definition of Adjusted Nominal Amount.

23

14.5

The following matters shall require consent of Holders representing at least three quarters

(3/4) of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Holders are voting at a Holders' Meeting

Any matter not covered by Clause 14.5 shall require the consent of Holders representing

more than fifty (50.00) per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Holders are

voting at a Holders' Meeting or for which Holders reply in a Written Procedure in

accordance with the instructions given pursuant to Clause 16.3. This includes, but is not

limited to, any amendment to or waiver o f these Terms and Conditions that does not require

a higher majority (other than an amendment or waiver permitted pursuant to Clause 17.1 (a),

(b) or (c)) or a termination o f the Bonds.

14.7

If the number of votes or replies are equal, the opinion which is most beneficial for the

Issuer, according to the chairman at a Holders' Meeting or the Agent in a Written Procedure,

will prevail. The chairman at a Holders' Meeting shall be appointed by the Holders in

accordance with Clause 14.6.

14.8

Quorum at a Holders' Meeting or in respect of a Written Procedure only exists if a Holder

(or Holders) representing at least twenty (20.00) per cent., or, if the matter to be resolved on

requires the consent of a qualified majority of at least three quarters (3/4) to be passed, fifty

(50.00) per cent., of the Adjusted Nominal Amount:

(a) i f at a Holders' Meeting, attend the meeting in person or by telephone conference (or appear through duly authorised representatives); or

(b) if in respect o f a Written Procedure, reply to the request.

14.9

Any decision which extends or increases the obligations of the Issuer or the Agent, or limits, reduces or extinguishes the rights or benefits of the Issuer or the Agent, under these Terms and Conditions shall be subject to the Issuer's or the Agent's consent, as appropriate.
A Holder holding more than one Bond need not use all its votes or cast all the votes to which it is entitled in the same way and may in its discretion use or cast some of its votes only.
The Issuer may not, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit o f any Holder for or as inducement to any consent under these Terms and Conditions, unless such consideration is offered to all Holders that consent at the relevant Holders' Meeting or in a Written Procedure within the time period stipulated for the consideration to be payable or the time period for replies in the Written Procedure, as the case may be.
A matter decided at a duly convened and held Holders' Meeting or by way o f Written Procedure is binding on all Holders, irrespective of them being present or represented at the Holders' Meeting or responding in the Written Procedure. The Holders that have not adopted or voted for a decision shall not be liable for any damages that this may cause other Holders.

Information about decisions taken at a Holders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure shall promptly be sent by notice to the Holders and published on the websites of the Issuer and the Agent, provided that a failure to do so shall not invalidate any decision made or voting result achieved. The minutes from the relevant Holders' Meeting or Written Procedure shall at the request o f a Holder be sent to it by the Issuer or the Agent, as applicable.
HOLDERS' MEETING
The Agent shall convene a Holders' Meeting by sending a notice thereof to each Holder no later than five (5) Business Days after receipt of a request from the Issuer or the Holder(s) (or such later date as may be necessary for technical or administrative reasons). If the Holders' Meeting has been requested by the Holder(s), the Agent shall send a copy o f the notice to the Issuer.
Should the Issuer want to replace the Agent, it may convene a Holders' Meeting in accordance with Clause 15.1 with a copy to the Agent. After a request from the Holders
25

pursuant to Clause 18.4.3, the Issuer shall no later than five (5) Business Days after receipt of such request (or such later date as may be necessary for technical or administrative reasons) convene a Holders' Meeting in accordance with Clause 15.1.

15.3

The notice pursuant to Clause 15.1 shall include (i) time for the meeting, (ii) place for the

meeting, (iii) agenda for the meeting (including each request for a decision by the Holders)

The Holders' Meeting shall be held no earlier than ten (10) Business Days and no later than

twenty (20) Business Days from the notice.

15.5

If the Agent, in breach of these Terms and Conditions, has not convened a Holders' Meeting

within five (5) Business Days after having received such notice, the requesting Person may

convene the Holders' Meeting itself. If the requesting Person is a Holder, the Issuer shall

upon request from such Holder provide the Holder with necessary information from the

register kept by the CSD and, if no Person to open the Holders' Meeting has been appointed

by the Agent, the meeting shall be opened by a Person appointed by the requesting Person.

15.6

At a Holders' Meeting, the Issuer, the Holders (or the Holders' representatives/proxies) and

the Agent may attend along with each of their representatives, counsels and assistants.

Further, the directors of the board, the managing director and other officials of the Issuer and

the Issuer's auditors may attend the Holders' Meeting. The Holders' Meeting may decide

that further individuals may attend. If a representative/proxy shall attend the Holders'

Meeting instead of the Holder, the representative/proxy shall present a duly executed proxy

or other document establishing its authority to represent the Holder.

15.7

Without amending or varying these Terms and Conditions, the Agent may prescribe such

further regulations regarding the convening and holding of a Holders' Meeting as the Agent

may deem appropriate. Such regulations may include a possibility for Holders to vote

without attending the meeting in person.

16.

WRITTEN PROCEDURE

16.1

The Agent shall instigate a Written Procedure no later than five (5) Business Days after

receipt of a request from the Issuer or the Holder(s) (or such later date as may be necessary

for technical or administrative reasons) by sending a communication to each such Person

who is registered as a Holder on the Business Day prior to the date on which the

communication is sent. If the Written Procedure has been requested by the Holder(s), the

Agent shall send a copy of the communication to the Issuer.

If the voting shall be made electronically, instructions for such voting shall be included in the communication.

16.4

If the Agent, in breach of these Terms and Conditions, has not instigated a Written

Person may instigate a Written Procedure itself. If the requesting Person is a Holder, the

Issuer shall upon request from such Holder provide the Holder with necessary information

from the register kept by the CSD.

16.5

When the requisite majority consents of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount pursuant to

Clauses 14.5 and 14.6 have been received in a Written Procedure, the relevant decision shall

time period for replies in the Written Procedure has not yet expired.

17.

18.2.2

these Terms and Conditions are duly registered with the CSD and each other relevant organisation or authority.
An amendment or waiver to these Terms and Conditions shall take effect on the date determined by the Holders' Meeting, in the Written Procedure or by the Agent, as the case may be.
APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THE AGENT
Appointment of Agent
By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Holder appoints the Agent to act as its agent in all matters relating to the Bonds and these Terms and Conditions, and authorises the Agent to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent, unless such consent is specifically required by these Terms and Conditions) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Bonds held by such Holder, including the winding-up, dissolution, liquidation, company reorganisation (Sw. foretagsrekonstruktion) or bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction) of the Issuer. By acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Holder confirms such appointment and authorisation for the Agent to act on its behalf.
Each Holder shall immediately upon request by the Agent provide the Agent with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent), as the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under these Terms and Conditions. The Agent is under no obligation to represent a Holder which does not comply with such request.
The Issuer shall promptly upon request provide the Agent with any documents and other assistance (in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent), that the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under these Terms and Conditions.
The Agent is entitled to fees for its work and to be indemnified for costs, losses and liabilities on the terms set out in these Terms and Conditions and the Agent Agreement, and the Agent's obligations as agent under these Terms and Conditions are conditioned upon the due payment of such fees and indemnifications.
The Agent may act as agent for several issues of securities issued by or relating to the Issuer and other Group Companies notwithstanding potential conflicts of interest.
Duties of the Agent
The Agent shall represent the Holders in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. However, the Agent is not responsible for the execution or enforceability o f these Terms and Conditions. The Agent shall keep the latest version of these Terms and Conditions (including any document amending these Terms and Conditions) available on the website of the Agent.
Upon request by a Holder, the Agent shall promptly distribute to the Holders any information from such Holder which relates to the Bonds (at the discretion o f the Agent).
28

18.2.3 18.2.4 18.2.5 18.2.6 18.2.7
18.2.8 18.2.9 18.2.10

The Agent may require that the requesting Holder reimburses any costs or expenses incurred, or to be incurred, by the Agent in doing so (including a reasonable fee for the work of the Agent) before any such information is distributed. The Agent shall upon request by a Holder disclose the identity of any other Holder who has consented to the Agent in doing so.
When acting in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, the Agent is always acting with binding effect on behalf of the Holders. The Agent shall carry out its duties under these Terms and Conditions in a reasonable, proficient and professional manner, with reasonable care and skill.
The Agent is entitled to delegate its duties to other professional parties, but the Agent shall remain liable for the actions of such parties under these Terms and Conditions.
The Agent shall treat all Holders equally and, when acting pursuant to these Terms and Conditions, act with regard only to the interests of the Holders and shall not be required to have regard to the interests or to act upon or comply with any direction or request of any other Person, other than as explicitly stated in these Terms and Conditions and the Agent Agreement.
The Agent shall be entitled to disclose to the Holders any event or circumstance directly or indirectly relating to the Issuer or the Bonds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agent may if it considers it to be beneficial to the interests of the Holders delay disclosure or refrain from disclosing certain information other than in respect of an Event of Default that has occurred and is continuing.
The Agent is entitled to engage external experts when carrying out its duties under these Terms and Conditions. The Issuer shall on demand by the Agent pay all reasonable costs for external experts engaged (i) after the occurrence of an Event of Default, (ii) for the purpose of investigating or considering an event which the Agent reasonably believes is or may lead to an Event of Default or a matter relating to the Issuer which the Agent reasonably believes may be detrimental to the interests of the Holders under these Terms and Conditions or (iii) when the Agent is to make a determination under these Terms and Conditions. Any compensation for damages or other recoveries received by the Agent from external experts engaged by it for the purpose of carrying out its duties under these Terms and Conditions shall be distributed in accordance with Clause 13 (Distribution o fproceeds).
The Agent shall enter into agreements with the CSD, and comply with such agreement and the CSD regulations applicable to the Agent, as may be necessary in order for the Agent to carry out its duties under these Terms and Conditions.
Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms and Conditions to the contrary, the Agent is not obliged to do or omit to do anything if it would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of any law or regulation.
If in the Agent's reasonable opinion the cost, loss or liability which it may incur (including reasonable fees to the Agent) in complying with instructions of the Holders, or taking any action at its own initiative, will not be covered by the Issuer, the Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with such instructions, or taking such action, until it has received such

18.3.3
18.3.4 18.3.5 18.4 18.4.1 18.4.2 18.4.3

funding or indemnities (or adequate security has been provided therefore) as it may reasonably require.
The Agent shall give a notice to the Holders (i) before it ceases to perform its obligations under these Terms and Conditions by reason of the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under these Terms and Conditions or the Agent Agreement, or (ii) if it refrains from acting for any reason described in Clause 18.2.10.
Limited liability for the Agent
The Agent will not be liable to the Holders for damage or loss caused by any action taken or omitted by it under or in connection with these Terms and Conditions, unless directly caused by its negligence or wilful misconduct. The Agent shall never be responsible for indirect loss.
The Agent shall not be considered to have acted negligently if it has acted in accordance with advice from or opinions of reputable external experts engaged by the Agent or if the Agent has acted with reasonable care in a situation when the Agent considers that it is detrimental to the interests of the Holders to delay the action in order to first obtain instructions from the Holders.
The Agent shall not be liable for any delay (or any related consequences) in crediting an account with an amount required pursuant to these Terms and Conditions to be paid by the Agent to the Holders, provided that the Agent has taken all necessary steps as soon as reasonably practicable to comply with the regulations or operating procedures of any recognised clearing or settlement system used by the Agent for that purpose.
The Agent shall have no liability to the Holders for damage caused by the Agent acting in accordance with instructions of the Holders given in accordance with Clause 14 (Decisions by Holders).
Any liability towards the Issuer which is incurred by the Agent in acting under, or in relation to, these Terms and Conditions shall not be subject to set-off against the obligations of the Issuer to the Holders under these Terms and Conditions.
Replacement of the Agent
Subject to Clause 18.4.6, the Agent may resign by giving notice to the Issuer and the Holders, in which case the Holders shall appoint a successor Agent at a Holders' Meeting convened by the retiring Agent or by way of Written Procedure initiated by the retiring Agent.
Subject to Clause 18.4.6, if the Agent is insolvent or becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the Agent shall be deemed to resign as Agent and the Issuer shall within ten (10) Business Days appoint a successor Agent which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable company which regularly acts as agent under debt issuances.
A Holder (or Holders) representing at least ten (10.00) per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount may, by notice to the Issuer (such notice may only be validly given by a Person who

18.4.4 18.4.5 18.4.6 18.4.7
18.4.8
19. 19.1 19.2

is a Holder on the Business Day immediately following the day on which the notice is received by the Issuer and shall, if given by several Holders, be given by them jointly), require that a Holders' Meeting is held for the purpose of dismissing the Agent and appointing a new Agent. The Issuer may, at a Holders' Meeting convened by it or by way of Written Procedure initiated by it, propose to the Holders that the Agent be dismissed and a new Agent appointed.
If the Holders have not appointed a successor Agent within ninety (90) calendar days after (i) the earlier of the notice of resignation was given or the resignation otherwise took place or (ii) the Agent was dismissed through a decision by the Holders, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Agent which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable company which regularly acts as agent under debt issuances.
The retiring Agent shall, at its own cost, make available to the successor Agent such documents and records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent under these Terms and Conditions.
The Agent's resignation or dismissal shall only take effect upon the appointment of a successor Agent and acceptance by such successor Agent of such appointment and the execution of all necessary documentation to effectively substitute the retiring Agent.
Upon the appointment of a successor, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of these Terms and Conditions but shall remain entitled to the benefit of these Terms and Conditions and remain liable under these Terms and Conditions in respect of any action which it took or failed to take whilst acting as Agent. Its successor, the Issuer and each of the Holders shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves under these Terms and Conditions as they would have had if such successor had been the original Agent.
In the event that there is a change of the Agent in accordance with this Clause 18.4, the Issuer shall execute such documents and take such actions as the new Agent may reasonably require for the purpose of vesting in such new Agent the rights, powers and obligation of the Agent and releasing the retiring Agent from its further obligations under these Terms and Conditions and the Agent Agreement. Unless the Issuer and the new Agent agrees otherwise, the new Agent shall be entitled to the same fees and the same indemnities as the retiring Agent.
APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THE ISSUING AGENT
The Issuer appoints the Issuing Agent to manage certain specified tasks under these Terms and Conditions and in accordance with the legislation, rules and regulations applicable to and/or issued by the CSD and relating to the Bonds.
The Issuing Agent may retire from its assignment or be dismissed by the Issuer, provided that the Issuer has approved that a commercial bank or securities institution approved by the CSD accedes as new Issuing Agent at the same time as the old Issuing Agent retires or is dismissed. If the Issuing Agent is insolvent or becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings,
31

the Issuer shall immediately appoint a new Issuing Agent, which shall replace the old Issuing Agent as issuing agent in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.

negative effect on any Holder or the listing of the Bonds listed on the corporate bond list of

Nasdaq Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market). The replacing CSD must be authorised

to professionally conduct clearing operations pursuant to the Swedish Securities Market Act

(Sw. lag (2007:528) om vardepappersmarknaden).

Subsidiary to enforce or recover any amount due or owing to it pursuant to these Terms and

Conditions, or to initiate, support or procure the winding-up, dissolution, liquidation,

company reorganisation (Sw. foretagsrekonstruktion) or bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) (or its

equivalent in any other jurisdiction) of the Issuer or a Subsidiary in relation to any of the

liabilities of the Issuer under these Terms and Conditions. Such steps may only be taken by

the Agent.

21.2

Clause 21.1 shall not apply if the Agent has been instructed by the Holders in accordance

with these Terms and Conditions to take certain actions but fails for any reason to take, or is

unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a Holder to provide documents in

accordance with Clause 18.1.2), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such

failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by

the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under these Terms

and Conditions or the Agent Agreement or by any reason described in Clause 18.2.10, such

failure must continue for at least forty (40) Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause

18.2.11 before a Holder may take any action referred to in Clause 21.1.

21.3

The provisions of Clause 21.1 shall not in any way limit an individual Holder's right to

claim and enforce payments which are due to it under Clause 10.4 (Mandatory repurchase

funds set aside for payments in respect of which the Holders' right to receive payment has been time-barred and has become void.

If the Issuer does not promptly issue a press release and the Agent considers it necessary to issue a press release containing such information before it can lawfully send a notice containing such information to the Holders, the Agent shall be entitled to issue such press release.
FORCE MAJEURE AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
