Certain figures included in this offering memorandum have been subject to rounding adjustments; accordingly, figures shown for the same category presented in different tables may vary slightly and figures shown as totals in certain tables may not actually be the sum of the figures which precede them.
For information regarding certain technical terms relating to the paper products industry which we use in this offering memorandum, see ''Annex A--Glossary''.
Enforcement of Civil Liabilities
We are a limited liability company organized under the laws of Norway. The submission to jurisdiction contained in Condition 18 (Governing law and jurisdiction) of the terms and conditions of the Notes is a valid submission to jurisdiction and any judgment obtained in the court of the State of New York in any Proceedings will be enforceable in Norway without the Norwegian courts reconsidering the merits of the action.
As regards actions that fall outside the scope of the submission to jurisdiction of Condition 18 (Governing law and jurisdiction), we wish to point out that all of the members of our Board of Directors and most of our executive officers are residents of Norway and a significant portion of our assets and subsidiaries are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such persons or to enforce against us or them in U.S. courts judgments obtained in such courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. We have been advised by Wiersholm Mellbye & Bech, our Norwegian counsel, that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Norway, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the United States. In addition, we have been advised by Wiersholm Mellbye & Bech that the United States and Norway do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, final judgments for the payment of money rendered by a U.S. court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the United States, would not be directly enforceable in Norway.
Stabilization
In connection with the issue of the notes, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (the ''Stabilizing Managers'') (or any person acting for the Stabilizing Managers) may over-allot or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail for a limited period. However, there may be no obligation on the Stabilizing Managers (or any agent of the Stabilizing Managers) to do this. Such stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time and must be brought to an end after a limited period. Such stabilizing shall be in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and rules.

Available Information
We publish annual reports, including consolidated financial statements for the preceding year prepared in accordance with Norwegian generally accepted accounting principles and quarterly interim reports, including unaudited summary financial information for the preceding quarter. Upon request, we will send holders of notes these annual reports and quarterly reports in either English or Norwegian. We are not required to file periodic reports under Section 13 or 15 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ''Exchange Act''). We do, however, furnish certain public reports and documents to the SEC pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act. If during any period we are not subject to and in compliance with the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act, we will duly provide to any holder of a note which is a ''restricted security'' within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act or to any prospective purchaser of a note as designated by a holder, upon the written request of the holder or the prospective purchaser addressed to us and delivered to us or the office of the registrar, the information specified in Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Summary
The following summary is qualified in its entirety by, and is subject to, the detailed information regarding our business and our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto.
General
We are one of the leading global publication paper companies. We are the second largest producer of newsprint and the third largest producer of magazine paper in the world. Our headquarters are located in Oslo, Norway and through our subsidiaries, joint ventures and interests in other companies, we wholly or partly own mills in 15 countries on five continents.
While geographically diverse, we are strategically focused on the production, marketing and distribution of publication paper. Publication paper includes newsprint and magazine paper, and represented approximately 93% of our half year 2003 net sales. Our principal markets for our newsprint products are Europe, Australasia, Asia and South America. In addition, we are present in North America as the largest shareholder in Norske Skog Canada Limited (''NorskeCanada''). The principal markets for our magazine paper products are Europe and North America.
In the last twelve years, we have grown from being a regional producer of a variety of paper, pulp and timber products to a global company focused on publication paper. During this period, we have divested virtually all of the units outside of our core business and expanded our annual publication paper production capacity from 1.3 million metric tonnes in 1991 to 7.9 million metric tonnes as of June 30, 2003. We are focused on creating shareholder value by improving operating efficiencies, reducing purchasing, marketing and administrative costs and streamlining our organizational and corporate structure.
Our total assets were NOK47.5 billion as at June 30, 2003, and for the six months ended June 30, 2003, we had operating revenue of NOK11,382 million and operating earnings of NOK685 million. As at September 1, 2003, our market capitalization was NOK16.5 billion.
Our business operates primarily in four geographic regions:
· Europe with nine wholly-owned paper mills in Norway, France, Austria, Germany, The Netherlands, and the Czech Republic.
· South America with two wholly-owned paper mills in Chile and Brazil.
· Australasia with three wholly-owned paper mills in Australia and New Zealand.
· Asia with our 50% interest in PanAsia Paper Company (''PanAsia''), which currently has four paper mills in China, Korea and Thailand. PanAsia expects to complete construction of a second paper mill in China by 2005. We also have a 33.65% interest in Malaysian Newsprint Industries, a Malaysian newsprint producer operating one paper mill.
In addition, we have a significant minority stake of 30.6% in NorskeCanada, which has operations in North America comprising four publication paper mills in Canada (two of which also produce pulp).
We have created a corporate management area that we call ''Partially Owned Companies'' with operational responsibility for our interests in PanAsia, NorskeCanada, and Malaysian Newsprint Industries.

Our business strategy and competitive strengths
· Our vision is to continue to be a leading international company within the paper and forest products industry.
· Our goal is to create value for our shareholders, matching or exceeding the performance of other leading paper and forest products companies.
As a measurement of this goal, we aim to achieve a return on capital employed of at least 13% throughout a business cycle. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
· Concentrate on our core publication paper business.
We believe that by concentrating our resources and capital on a narrow range of products, we have developed a high level of proficiency at manufacturing and a deep knowledge of our customer base and the market. We developed this strategy more than seven years ago and have systematically divested non-core assets, acquired strategic businesses involved in the production of publication papers and built new assets dedicated to the production of publication paper. In the first half of 2003, approximately 93% of our net sales were from publication paper compared to 64% in 1995.
· Continue to consolidate our global position.
We intend to maintain our position as one of the industry leaders in the paper and forest products industry. Our position as a leading global producer of publication papers will allow us to supply the needs of our global customers. We have largely completed an ambitious multi year program of acquisitions and divestitures and will seek to support future growth through a focus on achieving greater efficiencies in operations and in our corporate structure, and the continued evaluation of selected smaller acquisitions and new investment opportunities. In addition, we plan to build new production capacity only if there is sufficient demand to absorb the additional capacity.
· Cost-efficient production.
We strive to produce and supply our products on the most cost-efficient basis within each region where we compete. We expect to accomplish this goal by reducing our cost of production and by developing and focusing on the products we are able to produce most competitively. Reductions in our production costs should arise from economies of scale, continuous operational improvements, use of the lowest cost raw materials available within each region where we operate and cooperation among the regions to optimize trade flows. We may also make selected investments to achieve operational improvements. We continually evaluate the cost efficiency of our productive assets, and will consider replacing less efficient productive capacity with machines, mills and other producing assets of greater efficiency. If we do replace capacity, this may lead to accounting adjustments.
· Revised corporate structure.
As part of what we call our ''Improvement 2003'' program, we have revised aspects of our management structure by shortening reporting lines, devolving decision-making authority in sales and marketing to local sales offices (within the framework of guidelines set by central management) and by standardizing and further coordinating production methods and centralizing production management, administration, procurement and logistics functions, where these are likely to benefit from a global corporate perspective. This program has allowed us to introduce cost-saving and efficiency measures across all our business lines and to
2

better monitor and react to developments in our business environment. A goal of the program is to improve results (primarily through cost reduction measures) by NOK2 billion by the end of 2004 (measured against a baseline of our 2002 results and on a basis seeking to adjust for or exclude factors outside our control). As of June 30, 2003, we had achieved improvements of NOK320 million and believe we remain on course to achieve the targeted gain of NOK1 billion for the calendar year 2003.
These strategic aims are supported by what we see as our principal competitive strengths:
· Significant presence on five continents.
We have become one of the world's most global paper companies with mills in 15 countries and on five continents. We are the second largest publication paper producer globally based on production capacity and have a substantial market share in each of the regions in which we operate. Local presence gives us the ability to manage capacity on a regional basis, reducing the need for expensive transportation. Further, our proximity to our customers increases the potential for service agreements and integrated sales and distribution systems.
The following table sets forth our relative ranking and share of capacity for newsprint and magazine paper in our principal markets globally and by region as of June 30, 2003.

(2) Including our proportionate share of PanAsia's capacity and all of the capacity of NorskeCanada and Malaysian Newsprint Industries. We include all of the capacity of NorskeCanada and Malaysian Newsprint Industries (although we only own 30.6% and 33.65% of them, respectively) on the basis that we are the only paper company with a major interest in these entities.
(3) Based on all of the capacity of PanAsia and Malaysian Newsprint Industries.
(4) Based on all of the capacity of NorskeCanada.

· Leading position in growing markets.

We have significantly enhanced our position in the fast growing regions of Asia (excluding Japan), through our holding in PanAsia, and in South America. In addition, we expect to achieve higher levels of profitability in these markets because of our modern paper machines, our low operating costs and our proximity to our customers. In the first half of 2003, we achieved operating margins before depreciation of 34.3% in South America and 24.5% at PanAsia, higher than any of the other regions in which we operate. In addition, PanAsia has recently announced the construction of a new mill in Hebei, China with a planned annual capacity of 330,000 metric tonnes of newsprint, which will strengthen PanAsia's position in a market that has been experiencing a rapid growth in demand for newsprint in recent years and which we believe will continue to experience growth in demand.

3

· Low cost producer. Based on our own internal cost benchmarking analysis, we believe our newsprint production ranks in either the first or second quartile in terms of delivered cash cost within each region in which we operate (the first quartile being the lowest delivered cash cost). We also believe our uncoated magazine paper and our coated magazine paper production rank, respectively, in the first and second quartiles in Europe in terms of their delivered cash cost. · A focused company with an ability to realize efficiencies regionally and globally. Over the past decade, our business has grown rapidly and we have become a global company focused on the production of publication papers. A significant amount of our growth has been attributed to the acquisition of several publication paper businesses. Our success in integrating these businesses into our existing operations has provided us with considerable experience, particularly with publication papers, and has demonstrated our ability to realize cost efficiencies and operational improvements both regionally and globally. We have utilized our experience gained in these integration efforts to create a set of best practice procedures in order to standardize practices across mills and enhance operational efficiency. · Competitive assets. From 1998 through 2000, we invested approximately NOK6,488 million in our production facilities, including investment in a new paper machine at our mill in Golbey, France at a cost of approximately NOK2.8 billion. During the last three years, our capital expenditure has been strictly prioritized and kept below 50% of depreciation. We intend to maintain a capital expenditure to depreciation ratio of approximately 50% to 70% in the longer term. Capital expenditure for these purposes includes current investments in maintenance and the upgrading of paper machines but excludes any strategic investments (including new paper machines) which we may make in the future. We expect that capital expenditure will continue to be financed from our operational cash flow.

Risk Factors
In addition to the other information contained in this offering memorandum, you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating an investment in the notes.
Risks Relating to Our Business
Some of our operations are conducted through joint ventures and non wholly-owned subsidiaries.
We conduct some of our businesses through joint venture arrangements and other entities in which we do not have a controlling interest or in which we will not have a controlling interest in the future. These include a 50% interest in PanAsia, a 30.6% interest in NorskeCanada and a 33.65% interest in Malaysian Newsprint Industries. While we are able to influence the decisions of the boards and management of these entities, we cannot assure you that decisions taken by the boards and management of these entities will be consistent with our views. As a result, the initiatives and strategic direction of these entities could differ from our wishes and could adversely effect our financial condition or results of operations. In particular, we do not have direct access to the cash flow generated by these entities (other than through receipt of dividends from them) nor do we have unilateral control of their dividend policies.
Exchange rate fluctuations could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
We are exposed to exchange rate risk in several ways. The currencies of our revenues often do not match the currencies of our operating costs. As a consequence, there is a risk that changes in exchange rates could have a significant adverse effect on our reported profits.
Furthermore, changes in exchange rates can affect the relative competitive position of a paper mill. There is a risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our competitive ness relative to our competitors in different countries. In particular, due to the greater international scope of our operations compared to our competitors, we are more exposed than other companies to the effects of translating income back into a reporting currency, in our case, the Norwegian kroner.
In addition, because our financial statements are reported in Norwegian kroner but only a portion of our operations and assets are located in Norway, exchange rate fluctuations could have a significant adverse effect on our financial statements. We also face foreign exchange risk by virtue of our shareholdings in our foreign joint ventures. We cannot guarantee that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See ''Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Risk Management".
Our operations in emerging market countries could be negatively affected by instability in those countries.
We have manufacturing operations in emerging market countries including China, Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, Brazil and Chile. In the past, these countries have experienced sharp downturns in demand, high inflation or other economic instability. Economic instability in these countries could negatively affect our financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to continue operations in these countries or to earn a profit from our operations in these countries could also be negatively affected by changes in laws, such as the imposition of
11

restrictions on foreign ownership or repatriation of earnings. In addition, political unrest in these countries could restrict our ability to carry on operations.
Risks Relating to Our Industry
Prices for our products and raw materials have historically been volatile.
The markets for paper products such as newsprint and magazine paper are cyclical and have historically experienced price volatility due to imbalances between supply and demand. Supply depends primarily on fluctuations in available manufacturing capacity and capacity utilization rates. Demand for paper products depends on the overall strength of the economies of the countries in which we do business, levels of inventory of paper products and consumer preferences. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain or increase current price levels for our products. Industry participants may add new capacity or increase capacity utilization rates, thereby potentially causing supply to exceed demand and prices to fall. Any significant downturn in the price levels for our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See ''Our Business--Industry Overview''.
In addition, because we are narrowly focused on the production of publication paper, a sharp downturn in prices for publication paper would affect us more than it would affect a more diversified paper company.
Our principal raw materials include wood, waste paper, chemical pulp and chemicals. In 2002, raw materials accounted for approximately 36% of our operating expenses. We are a focused company and are therefore dependent on the price of relatively few raw materials. The cost of these raw materials has historically changed unexpectedly and has not necessarily correlated to changes in the market price for our products. Any unexpected increase in raw material costs would have an adverse effect on our financial performance.
Our industry is competitive.
The paper industry is comprised of a small number of large global producers and a large number of small regional producers and we face competition from all of them. Global producers are typically large, well capitalized companies that may have greater flexibility in pricing and financial resources for marketing, investment and expansion than we do. It is also possible that existing and new competitors could construct new paper machines with lower operating costs than our paper machines.
We could be required to make large investments to comply with environmental regulations.
We are subject to a wide variety of environmental regulations in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Compliance with these rules and regulations at the federal, state, provincial and local levels is an important aspect of our ability to continue our operations. In the 1990s, we invested more than NOK2,200 million in environmental measures. We cannot guarantee that we will not incur significant additional environmental costs and liabilities which may include liabilities incurred by businesses before we acquired them. Also, countries could adopt tighter, more stringent environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies than apply at present. See ''Our Business--Environmental".
12

We may not be able to react quickly or profitably to changes in consumer preferences.
Changes in consumers' preferences have affected the overall demand for publication papers and the demand for certain grades or types of publication papers. Some of the most significant changes in consumer preferences include the increase in direct-mail advertising, increasing interest in environmentally-friendly products and increased use of the internet and electronic media.
Paper companies have responded to changes in consumer preferences by improving the quality of existing products, by developing new products such as paper with increased recovered paper content and by increasing production of lighter-weight coated and supercalendered magazine paper. Our ability to compete in our industry in the future will depend on our ability to respond quickly to changes in consumer preferences and upon our ability to produce these products profitably.
In addition, there is a risk that the use of the internet as a source of information and advertising and as a publication medium could increase and significantly reduce the circulation of newspapers and magazines. This would cause a significant decline in the demand and price for newsprint and magazine paper and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Risk Factors Relating to the Notes
An active trading market for the notes may not develop and the price of the notes may be volatile.
Both tranches of the notes are new securities for which there is currently no public market. We cannot predict the extent of investor interest in either tranche of the notes or whether there will be a trading market for either tranche of the notes, or the ability of the holders to sell their notes or the price at which they may be able to sell their notes. The liquidity of any market for either tranche of the notes will depend upon the number of holders of each tranche of notes, the interest of security dealers in making a market for either tranche of the notes and other factors. If a liquid trading market for either tranche of the notes does not develop, the price of either tranche of the notes may decline and investors may have difficulty selling their notes.
Our ability to pay principal and/or interest on the notes may be affected by our organizational structure.
We own our operations within Norway. However, outside of Norway our subsidiaries conduct the majority of our operations and directly own the majority of our assets. Our subsidiaries have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amount under the notes or to make any funds available for such payment. Therefore, our operating cash flow and our ability to meet our debt obligations, including the notes, will depend on the cash flow provided by our subsidiaries in the form of loans, dividends or other payments to us as a shareholder. Additional indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries may restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other similar payments to us. In the event of the insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of one of our subsidiaries, all creditors of such subsidiary would be entitled to payment in full out of the assets of such subsidiary before we, as a shareholder, would be entitled to any payments. Creditors of subsidiaries might have to be paid in full before our creditors, including holders of our debt securities, and might be entitled to receive any payment from the assets of such subsidiary.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Norwegian GAAP. Significant differences exist between Norwegian GAAP and U.S. GAAP. See "Summary o f Certain Significant Differences Between U.S. GAAP and Norwegian GAAP".
Overview
We are one of the leading global paper companies. Through our subsidiaries, joint ventures and affiliated companies, we have mills in 15 countries on five continents. While geographically diverse, we are strategically focused on the production, marketing and distribution of publication paper. Publication paper represented approximately 93% of our half year 2003 net sales. In addition to newsprint and magazine paper, we also produce small amounts of other paper grades. Our principal markets for newsprint are Europe, Australasia, Asia and South America. In addition, we are present in North America as the largest shareholder in NorskeCanada. Our principal markets for magazine paper are Europe and North America.
Market Developments
Europe
European demand for newsprint in the first half of 2003 remained weak, in line with the previous year. In 2002, demand for newsprint, both standard and improved qualities, fell by 6% in Europe due to the weak economic climate and a decrease in advertising expenditure in most European countries. This decline was partly offset by a pick-up in demand from outside Europe and North America, with European exports increasing by close to 50%. Newsprint prices declined, from a historically high level in 2001, by approximately 10% in 2002 and dropped further by another approximately 10% for 2003. Export markets also provided low price levels for 2002, and industry-wide capacity utilization in Europe averaged 91% in 2002, down from 92% in 2001.
The weak economic climate and a decrease in advertising expenditure in most European countries is also influencing demand for various magazine paper grades. Demand for uncoated magazine paper has remained fairly stable in the first half of 2003 and prices have been low. Total deliveries of uncoated magazine paper to Western Europe decreased by 1% in 2002. Shipments of magazine papers to North America from Europe increased by 2% in 2002. The price of uncoated magazine paper in Europe and the United States declined by 5% from 2001 to 2002. Capacity utilization for the industry in Europe averaged 91.5% in 2002, down from 94% in 2001.
Demand for coated magazine paper increased by 3% during the first half of 2003 compared to 2002. Total deliveries of coated magazine paper to Europe increased by 2% in 2002, due to increased demand and increased prices for coated fine paper, a paper grade which competes against coated magazine paper. Prices of coated magazine paper declined by 11% in 2002 compared to 2001. Capacity utilization for the industry in Europe averaged 80% in 2002, down from 81% in 2001.
20

South America
Demand for newsprint in South America weakened in the first half of 2003 due to a generally weak regional economy. The decrease was 7% when compared with the first half of 2002, mainly due to a decrease in demand of 70% in Venezuela, 8% in Colombia and 4% in Brazil. Demand increased by 20% in Argentina during the second half of 2003 but this was from a low demand level in 2002.
Increased supply from North America was a factor in low price levels in Brazil. We expect that there will be an increase in prices per metric tonne in Brazil during the second half of 2003 and that other markets in South America will track this price increase.
During the second half of 2002, newsprint prices in Brazil declined significantly from price levels in 2001. Newsprint prices in Chile are also influenced by North American pricing and experienced similar decreases.
Australasia
Market demand in Australasia increased by 7% during the first half of 2003 compared with 2002. Effective from July 1, 2003, newsprint prices in Australia have been adjusted in accordance with long-term contracts. The new prices, in Australian dollars, are approximately 4% lower than the 2002 prices. Market conditions in 2002 were stable compared with 2001. See ''Our Business--Locations of Operations--Australasia".
Asia
The price trend for newsprint in several Asian markets has been negative, while the prices for raw materials and energy have increased. Demand in the first half of 2003 essentially remained flat compared with the first half of 2002. Effective in the third quarter of 2003, a newsprint price increase has been announced for customers without annual sales contracts. Newsprint demand in Asia increased by about 6% in 2002 from a low level in 2001. Korea and China had particularly high levels of consumption, while Thailand experienced weaker market trends in both prices and volumes.
North America
North American newsprint remained weak in the first half of 2003 but price increases have been implemented during the second quarter, and further increases have been announced. Newsprint demand in North America fell by 2.5% in 2002 compared with 2001, affected by reduced advertising. The magazine paper market remained stable.
Recent Developments
Launch of Improvement 2003 Program
As part of what we call our ''Improvement 2003'' program, we have revised aspects of our management structure by shortening reporting lines, devolving decision-making authority in sales and marketing to local sales offices (within the framework of guidelines set by central management) and by standardizing and further coordinating production methods and centralizing production management, administration, procurement and logistics functions, where these are likely to benefit from a global corporate perspective. This program has allowed us to introduce cost-saving and efficiency measures across all our business lines and to better monitor and react to developments in our business environment. A goal of the program
21

is to improve results (primarily through cost-reduction measures) by NOK2 billion by the end of 2004 (measured against a baseline of our 2002 results and on a basis seeking to adjust for or exclude factors outside our control). As of June 30, 2003, we had achieved improvements of NOK320 million and believe we remain on course to achieve the targeted gain of NOK1 billion for the calendar year 2003.
Sale of Power Plants
As part of our efforts to focus on the publication papers business, we have continued to divest non-core assets. In 2003, we have sold our 13 power plants in Norway for NOK1.3 billion.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our principal accounting policies are described in more detail in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements appearing on page F-6 of this offering memorandum. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with Norwegian GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. However, actual results and timing of recognition could differ from those estimates.
Management believes that the accounting policies discussed below represent those accounting policies requiring the exercise of judgment where a different set of judgments could result in the greatest changes to our reported results.
Assets and Liabilities in Foreign Currencies
Unhedged assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Norwegian kroner at the year-end exchange rate. Balance sheet items in foreign currencies that are hedged by financial instruments are entered at the hedging exchange rate. Balance sheet items in foreign currencies that hedge against each other are entered at the year-end exchange rate. Gains and losses due to changes in currency rates on debt in foreign currency which are designated and are hedges of the value of a subsidiary entered in a foreign currency are recorded directly in shareholders' equity, together with the translation difference arising from the translation of the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary. Gains and losses due to changes in currency rates on balance sheet items related to operations is included in our operating earnings. Gains and losses due to changes in currency rates on other balance sheet items are classified as financial items.
Fixed Assets and Depreciation
Fixed assets are valued at historical cost. The acquisition costs of tangible assets having long term future economic benefits are capitalized and classified as assets in our balance sheet. Spare parts are capitalized with the asset to which they pertain. For major investments with a long production time, interest is capitalized as a part of the acquisition cost. Expenditure to increase capacity or improve quality that represents a future increase in earnings is capitalized in the balance sheet. Maintenance costs are expensed as an operating cost.
Ordinary depreciation is calculated from the time when the use of the tangible asset commences and is calculated on the basis of the economic life of the asset.
22

In 2002, we implemented the preliminary Norwegian GAAP accounting standard on impairment of fixed assets. According to this standard, we review our fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired, in which case we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, a write-down is recognized to the extent the asset's carrying value exceeds the sum of the expected future cash flows, discounted at a discount rate determined by our management. The discount rate is derived from our cost of capital plus an appropriate risk premium.
Income taxes
Deferred income taxes are calculated based on temporary timing differences between financial accounts and tax accounts and any tax losses that can be carried forward at the end of the financial year. Tax-reducing temporary differences and losses to be carried forward are set off against tax-increasing temporary differences reversed during the same period. Full provision is normally made according to the debt method without discounting to present value. Deferred tax in acquired companies is valued at present value when this provides a true reflection of the underlying transaction.
We review our tax assets and liabilities on a periodic basis and adjust these balances as appropriate. We believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law. However, should our tax positions be challenged and not prevail, different outcomes could result and have a significant impact on the amounts reported through our consolidated financial statements. The net deferred tax liabilities under Norwegian GAAP were NOK2,021 million, or 4.5% of total assets, as of December 31, 2002 and NOK3,174 million, or 5.6% of total assets, as of December 31, 2001.
Pensions
We operate a number of defined benefit and contribution plans throughout the world.
Pension obligations are calculated as the discounted value of the future pension benefits deemed to have accrued at year-end, based on the employees earning pension rights steadily throughout the working period. Funds belonging to the pension scheme are assessed at their fair value and are entered net against pension obligations in the balance sheet. Each individual pension plan is assessed separately, but the value of over-financing in one plan and under financing in another is entered net in the balance sheet, provided that pension scheme funds are transferable between the plans. Net pension scheme funds are entered as long-term receivables and net pension obligations as long-term debt.
Net pension costs for the period are included in ''wages and personnel expenses'' and consist of the present value of pensions earned in the year, any change in the present value of pension liabilities, anticipated returns on pension scheme funds, the expensed portion of changes in estimated pension liabilities, the expensed portion of difference between actual and anticipated returns, and accrued social security costs.
The effect of changes in estimated and actual pension liabilities and the difference between actual and anticipated returns for any plan are accrued over the estimated remaining pension earning period or expected life when the cumulative effect exceeds 10% of the higher of the plan's assets and its liabilities.

Six Months Ended June 30, 2003 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2002
Operating Revenue
Operating revenue comprises the operating revenue realized by each of our business areas and by other activities. Operating revenue in the first half of 2003 decreased slightly by 1.7% to NOK11,382 million from NOK11,574 million in the first half of 2002. The decrease in overall revenue is primarily attributable to declines in the Australasia and Asia regions due to lower prices and currency translation effects due to a stronger Norwegian kroner in the first half of 2003, which was partly offset by an increase in deliveries.

26

The following is a discussion of the operating revenue realized by each of our business areas and by our Other Activities.
Europe. Our operating revenue in Europe consists mainly of sales of our newsprint and magazine paper production. Total operating revenue in Europe remained essentially flat at NOK6,886 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK6,870 million in the first half of 2002, primarily as a result of increases in revenue for magazine paper being offset by decreases in revenue for newsprint.
Operating revenue for newsprint decreased by NOK173 million to NOK3,548 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003 from NOK3,721 million for the six months ended June 30, 2002. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower sales prices.
Operating revenue for magazine paper increased by NOK189 million to NOK3,338 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003 from NOK3,149 million for the six months ended June 30, 2002. The increase is primarily attributable to a higher delivery volume of 648,000 tonnes for the six months ended June 30, 2003, compared to 559,000 tonnes for the six months ended June 30, 2002, which was only partly offset by lower prices.
Operating revenue for the first half of 2003 also includes approximately NOK178 million of gains from electricity trading, compared to approximately NOK20 million for the first half of 2002. The electricity trading gains occurred due to a combination of favorable pricing in the electricity market in Norway and surplus electricity due to downtime in our mills in Norway. These gains will not necessarily recur in the future.
Production of publication paper in Europe increased by 102,000 metric tonnes or 6.5% to 1.666.000 metric tonnes in the first half of 2003. Our newsprint paper is delivered, to a large extent, on the basis of annual contracts. As a result, our prices for newsprint are generally stable throughout the year.
South America. Our operating revenue in South America consists mainly of sales of newsprint production. Total operating revenue in South America in the first half of 2003 was NOK551 million a decrease of 3.2% from NOK569 million for the first half of 2002. This decrease is primarily the result of a decline in newsprint prices. Our operations in South America produced 161,000 metric tonnes of newsprint in the first half of 2003, which was a slight increase from our production of 157,000 metric tonnes in the first half of 2002. The average delivered price for our newsprint declined by 10% during the first half of 2003 compared to the first half of 2002. See ''Our Business--Locations of Operations--South America''.
Australasia. Our operating revenue in Australasia consists mainly of sales of our newsprint production. Total operating revenue in Australasia in the first half of 2003 was NOK1,874 million a decrease of NOK80 million from the first half of 2002. This decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in the benchmark price for newsprint on the west coast of the United States, which is the pricing basis for the yearly repricing of our contracts in Australasia. See ''Our Business--Locations of Operations--Australasia". Australasia produced 423.000 metric tonnes of newsprint in the first half of 2003. We increased our production by 9.000 metric tonnes during the first half of 2003 primarily due to an increase in market demand in Australia. The average realized price for our newsprint declined by 7% during the first half of 2003 compared to the first half of 2002.
Asia. Our operating revenue in Asia consists of sales of newsprint produced by PanAsia. We include 50% of PanAsia's operating revenue in our consolidated revenue. Our operating
27

revenue in Asia decreased by approximately 12.8% to NOK1,141 million in the first half of 2003 from NOK1,309 million in the first half of 2002 primarily as a result of a one-time increase in paper demand in South Korea during the preparations for the World Cup soccer tournament in 2002. In addition, a strike at a large mill of one of our principal competitors in the first half of 2002 shifted certain production orders to PanAsia. Production of standard and improved newsprint in Asia increased by 19,000 metric tonnes or 6.5% to 313,000 metric tonnes in the first half of 2003. Average realized prices for newsprint decreased by 4% in the first half of 2003 compared to the first half of 2002.
Other Activities. Other Activities includes other industry in Norway and other revenues. Other industry in Norway includes particleboards, Norwegian forests, hydro power and other minor activities. Other revenues include revenue from sales of paper by PanAsia which are not manufactured locally and revenues from wood and energy sold to external parties from our European activities. Total other activities increased by NOK164 million, a 17.4% increase to NOK1,106 million for the first half of 2003 compared to NOK942 million for the first half of 2002. The increase is principally due to a NOK250 million increase in other revenues to NOK850 million, which was only partially offset by a NOK86 million decrease in other industry in Norway, mainly due to the sales of our power generating assets. The increase in other revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of paper by PanAsia and energy trading.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses include the cost of materials, wages, salaries and other personnel expenses, ordinary depreciation and other operating expenses incurred by each of our business areas and by other activities. Operating expenses in the first half of 2003 increased by 2.7% to NOK10,696 million from NOK10,412 million in the first half of 2002. The increase in our overall operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in our cost of materials, in particular, due to increased production volumes. We are beginning to see the positive impact of our Improvement 2003 program, which made a positive contribution of NOK320 million to operating earnings for the first half of 2003. We believe we will achieve an improvement of NOK1 billion for the calendar year 2003 under this program, mainly in the form of cost reductions.
Cost of materials includes the cost of the raw materials for our production, principally comprising wood fiber, recovered paper, purchased market pulp, chemicals and energy. Cost of materials increased by approximately 5.8% to NOK5,440 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK5,144 million in the first half of 2002. On a cost per tonne basis, adjusting for currency fluctuations and production volumes, there was a reduction of approximately 2% per tonne from the first half of 2002 to the first half of 2003 for the mills which we wholly own.
Wages, salaries and personnel expenses include salaries, wages, pension costs, social security contributions and other benefits. Wages, salaries and personnel expenses decreased by approximately 2.1% to NOK1,737 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK1,775 million in the first half of 2002. The decline in salaries and personnel expenses reflects the initial results of personnel reduction efforts as part of our Improvement 2003 program.
Depreciation and amortization is principally made up of the annual depreciation of our fixed assets and amortization of goodwill. Depreciation and amortization decreased by approxi mately 5.0% to NOK1,621 million from NOK1,707 million in the first half of 2002. Of this
28

amount, NOK132 million relates to amortization of goodwill on our balance sheet for the first half of 2003. The amortization of goodwill principally relates to our acquisitions of Fletcher Challenge Paper in 2000 and of Walsum and Parenco in 2001.
Other operating expenses include distribution costs, packaging, contract services, marketing costs, administration costs and losses on bad debt. Other operating expenses decreased by approximately 3.0% to NOK2,133 million in the first half of 2003 from NOK2,199 million in the first half of 2002.
The following is a discussion of the operating expenses incurred by each of our business areas and by Other Activities.
Europe. Our operating expenses in Europe mainly consist of expenses we incur in the production of newsprint and magazine paper. Total operating expenses in Europe increased by approximately 3.8% to NOK6,383 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK6,152 million in the first half of 2002. This increase is primarily the result of a 6.4% increase in operating costs in magazine papers to NOK3,003 million for the first half of 2003, combined with a 1.5% increase in operating costs for newsprint to NOK3,380 million for the first half of 2003. The increase in costs for magazine papers is primarily due to higher production volumes.
South America. Our operating expenses in South America mainly consist of expenses we incur in the production of newsprint. Total operating expenses in South America decreased by approximately 16.4% to NOK488 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK584 million in the first half of 2002. This decrease is primarily the result of the termination on March 31, 2003 of our Norske Skog Klabin joint venture in Brazil. See ''Our Business--Locations of Operations--South America.''
Australasia. Our operating expenses in Australasia mainly consist of the expenses incurred in the production of newsprint. Total operating expenses in Australasia increased by approxi mately 5.5% to NOK1,674 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK1,587 in the first half of 2002. This increase occurred principally as a result of a rise in energy prices in New Zealand and recovered paper prices in Australia.
Asia. Our operating expenses in Asia mainly consist of expenses incurred in the production of newsprint by PanAsia. Total operating expenses in Asia remained essentially flat, increasing by NOK7 million to NOK1,007 million in the first half of 2003 from NOK1,000 million in the first half of 2002.
Other Activities. The operating expenses of other activities increased by approximately 20.9% to NOK1,115 million in the first half of 2003 from NOK922 million in the first half of 2002, primarily due to increases in the volume of paper sold by PanAsia on behalf of third parties and energy sold to third parties.
Operating Earnings
Our operating earnings in the first half of 2003 declined by 41.0% to NOK685 million from NOK1,162 million in the first half of 2002 and was 6.0% as a percentage of operating revenue compared to 10.0% in the first half of 2002. The decline in operating earnings occurred because of a combination of a 1.7% decline in operating revenues and a 2.7% increase in operating expenses, which was largely due to an increase in our production of 5.5%.
29

Affiliated Companies
Our share of loss in affiliated companies includes our share of the net loss of Malaysian Newsprint Industries and our share of the net loss of NorskeCanada. Our share of loss in affiliated companies was NOK110 million in the first half of 2003 compared to a loss of NOK171 million in the first half of 2002. The loss in the first half of 2003 is primarily due to our share of loss in NorskeCanada.
Financial Items
Financial items principally comprises interest expense from indebtedness, gains and losses on foreign exchange and interest rate hedging and interest income from cash and cash equivalent investments. In the first half of 2003, the net expense from financial items increased to NOK932 million from NOK71 million in the first half of 2002. The increase in net expense was principally due to losses on currency hedging of our net cash flow in the first half of 2003, while in 2002 we had gains on our currency hedging. In general, we hedge between 50% to 100% of the currency exposure on our net operational cash flows on a rolling twelve-month basis.
Operating Earnings Before Taxation
Operating earnings before tax was NOK550 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK920 million in the first half of 2002.
Taxation
Taxation for the first half of 2003 was NOK449 million compared to NOK311 million in the first half of 2003. As a percentage of operating earnings before tax, taxation was 81.6% in the first half of 2003. Taxation increased in the first half of 2003 primarily due to a natural resources tax on the sale of our power plants in Norway.
Net Earnings
Net earnings were NOK100 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK606 million in the first half of 2002. Earnings per share after tax were NOK0.76 for the first half of 2003 compared to NOK4.58 for the first half of 2002. The consolidated return on capital employed was approximately 3.5% on an annualized basis in the first half of 2003 compared to approximately 5.5% on an annualized basis in the first half of 2002.
Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2001
Changes in Our Structure in 2002 and 2001
When comparing results from 2002 and 2001 it is important to note several changes to our organizational structure which occurred during this time. Most significantly, our consolidated results for the first eight months of 2001 include the results of NorskeCanada, as we owned 50.8% of it up to this time. In August 2001, as a result of its acquisition of Pacifica Papers, a share issuance by NorskeCanada reduced our ownership interest to 36.1%, and the results of NorskeCanada have thereafter no longer been consolidated, but instead have been accounted for on an equity basis. In May 2002, an additional share issuance by NorskeCanada further reduced our interest from 36.1% to 30.6%. In addition, in August 2001 we increased our ownership interest in PanAsia by 16.7% from 33.3% to 50% and at the end of November 2001,
30

we acquired the Parenco and Walsum mills in Europe, following the sale of the Tasman Pulp mill in New Zealand in April 2001.
Operating Revenue
Operating revenue in 2002 decreased by 22.7% to NOK23,471 million from NOK30,354 million in 2001. The decrease in overall operating revenue is primarily attributable to the deconsolida tion of NorskeCanada in August 2001, a general strengthening of the Norwegian kroner and weak market conditions for publication paper products.
The following is a discussion of the operating revenue realized by each of our business areas and by our other activities.
Europe. Our operating revenue in Europe decreased marginally by NOK132 million to NOK14,087 million in 2002 compared to NOK14,219 million in 2001. This was primarily the result of a reduction in the price of newsprint in 2002 compared to 2001, which was partly offset by the additional sales volumes following from the acquisition of Walsum and Parenco.
Production of publication paper in Europe increased by 575,000 metric tonnes or 22.0% to 3.192.000 metric tonnes in 2002. Production of newsprint increased by 155,000 metric tonnes, or 8.8%, to 1,925,000 metric tonnes in 2002. Production of magazine paper increased by 420.000 metric tonnes, or 49.6%, to 1,267,000 metric tonnes. The increase in production of newsprint and magazine papers is primarily attributable to our acquisitions of the Walsum and Parenco mills. Our newsprint is delivered on the basis of annual contracts and our uncoated magazine paper is delivered to a large extent on the basis of annual contracts, so that prices for both are generally stable throughout the year. New annual contracts for 2002 resulted in average realized newsprint prices decreasing by 10% in 2002 compared to 2001 and average realized uncoated magazine paper prices decreasing by 10% in 2002 compared to 2001. Average realized coated magazine paper prices decreased by 12% in 2002 compared to 2001. These price reductions reflect general developments in the market for magazine paper prices.
South America. Our operating revenue in South America decreased by approximately 42.9% to NOK1,107 million in 2002 from NOK1,939 million in 2001, primarily as a result of prices declines, which was combined with the exchange rate impact of a weaker Brazilian real compared to the Norwegian kroner. Our operations in South America produced 332,000 metric tonnes of newsprint in 2002, a 5.7% increase from 2001.
Australasia. Our operating revenue in Australasia decreased by approximately 14.9% to NOK3,807 million in 2002 from NOK4,473 million in 2001 primarily as a result of a 7% price decline in newsprint in the second half of 2002 and the divestiture of our pulp mill in New Zealand in 2001. Our operations in Australasia produced 832,000 metric tonnes of newsprint in 2002, a 1.8% increase from 817,000 metric tonnes in 2001.
Asia. The operating revenue from our share of PanAsia's operations increased by approximately 10.4% to NOK2,688 million in 2002 from NOK2,434 million in 2001, primarily as a result of the 16.7% increase in our share of PanAsia in August 2001. The production of newsprint of our share of PanAsia's operations increased by 163,000 metric tonnes or 34.8% to 635,000 metric tonnes in 2002, largely as a result of the increased demand due to the World Cup soccer tournament in South Korea, a strike at one of our competitors and our increased share of ownership in PanAsia.
Other Activities. Total operating revenue from Other Activities decreased by approximately 16.7% to NOK1,931 million in 2002 from NOK2,319 million in 2001. Other industry in Norway
31

produced operating revenues of NOK682 million in 2002, a decline of 26.7% from NOK930 million in 2001. Other revenues declined by NOK140 million, or 10.1%, from NOK1,389 million in 2001 to NOK1,249 million in 2002. The decline in Other Activities is primarily due to our deconsolidation of our interest in the Union Geithus company, together with a reduction of revenues from our particleboard mill in Norway and certain other minor divestitures.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses in 2002 decreased by approximately 14.6% to NOK21,565 million from NOK25,258 million in 2001. The decrease in our overall operating expenses was primarily due to our deconsolidation of NorskeCanada and the general strengthening of the Norwegian kroner, which was partly offset by the acquisition of Walsum and Parenco.
Cost of materials decreased by approximately 9.6% to NOK10,559 million in 2002 compared to NOK11,679 million in 2001. This decrease primarily resulted from the deconsolidation of NorskeCanada and the general strengthening of the Norwegian kroner, which was partly offset by the acquisition of Walsum and Parenco and an increase in recovered paper prices from 2001 to 2002.
Wages, salaries and personnel expenses decreased by approximately 10.1% to NOK3,514 million in 2002 compared to NOK3,909 million in 2001. The decline in salaries and personnel expenses mainly reflects the deconsolidation of NorskeCanada and the general strengthening of the Norwegian kroner, which was partly offset by the acquisition of Walsum and Parenco.
Depreciation and amortization decreased slightly by NOK31 million to NOK3,292 million in 2002 from NOK3,323 million in 2001, of which NOK252 million in 2002 relates to amortization of goodwill compared to NOK253 million in 2001.
Other operating expenses decreased by approximately 28% to NOK4,406 million in 2002 from NOK6,117 million in 2001 primarily as a result of a decrease in distribution costs combined with a decrease in costs for maintenance materials and service as well as the deconsolidation of NorskeCanada and the general strengthening of the Norwegian kroner, which was partly offset by the acquisition of Walsum and Parenco.
The following is a discussion of the operating expenses incurred by each of our business areas and by Other Activities.
Europe. Our operating expenses in Europe increased by approximately 17.6% to NOK12,898 million in 2002 compared to NOK10,972 million in 2001. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to our acquisition of the Walsum and Parenco mills in August 2001.
South America. Our operating expenses in South America decreased by approximately 23.9% to NOK1,116 million in 2002 compared to NOK1,466 in 2001 primarily as a result of the exchange rate impact of a weaker Brazilian real compared to the Norwegian kroner.
Australasia. Our operating expenses in Australasia decreased by approximately 13.0% to NOK3,261 million in 2002 compared to NOK3,748 in 2001 primarily as a result of the divestiture of our pulp mill in New Zealand in 2001.
Asia. Our operating expenses in Asia increased by approximately 16.9% to NOK2,126 million in 2002 from NOK1,818 million in 2001, mainly due to our 16.7% increase in our ownership of PanAsia.
32

Other Activities. The operating expenses of other activities decreased by approximately 15.2% to NOK1,884 million in 2002 from NOK2,221 million in 2001. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to the deconsolidation of our interest in the Union Geithus company.
Operating Earnings
Operating earnings in 2002 declined by 74.4% to NOK1,906 million, before restructuring costs of NOK600 million, from NOK5,096 million in 2001 and constituted 5.6% of operating revenue compared to 16.8% in 2001. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to the 22.7% decrease in operating revenue, which was only partly offset by a 14.6% decrease in our operating costs, including NOK600 million of restructuring costs associated with our Improvement 2003 program.
Affiliated Companies
Our share of earnings in affiliated companies was a loss of NOK290 million in 2002 compared to a gain of NOK16 million in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a loss of NOK245 million from NorskeCanada and a loss of NOK58 million from Malaysian Newsprint Industries, both of which were primarily due to weaker markets for publication paper.
Financial Items
In 2002, financial items decreased to net financial expenses of NOK405 million from net financial expenses of NOK1,376 million in 2001. The decrease was principally due to a profit on realized and unrealized foreign currency of NOK893 million in 2002 compared with a loss of NOK30 million in 2001. Net interest expense was NOK1,203 million in 2002 compared to NOK1,231 million in 2001.
Other Items
Other items increased by NOK37 million to NOK195 million in 2002 from NOK158 million in 2001. Other items consisted primarily of sales of forests in Sweden and southern Norway.
Earnings Before Taxation
Earnings before taxation was NOK806 million in 2002 compared to NOK3,894 million in 2001.
Taxation
Taxation for 2002 was a net gain of NOK362 million, due to a change in Australian tax rules and a revaluation of our tax position related to acquisitions in 2002, compared to a net tax expense of NOK1,234 million in 2001. As a percent of ordinary earnings before tax, the gain from taxation income was 45% in 2002.
Net Earnings
Net earnings (after deduction of the minority's share) were NOK1,162 million in 2002, a 53.4% decrease from net earnings of NOK2,494 million in 2001. Earnings per share after tax were NOK8.79 in 2002 compared to NOK20.68 in 2001. Our return on capital employed was 4.7% in 2002 compared to 13.7% in 2001.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
To date, we have generally funded capital expenditures through a combination of cash flow, capital increases and debt. Historically, we have generated cash flow primarily through our operations. Net cash flow from operations amounted to NOK1,088 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003, and NOK3,687 million in 2002 compared to NOK7,052 million in 2001. We have credit facilities (primarily denominated in euros and U.S. dollars) to fund capital expenditures and for working capital purposes.
Our total capital investment during the first half of 2003 was NOK438 million or approxi mately 27.0% of depreciation. Our total capital investment during 2002 was NOK1,146 million or approximately 37.7% of depreciation compared to 47.7% in 2001. We intend to maintain a capital expenditure to depreciation ratio of approximately 50% to 70% in the longer term. Capital expenditure for these purposes includes current investments in maintenance and the upgrading of paper machines but excludes any strategic investments (including new paper machines) which we may make in the future.
Our most significant capital expenditures since January 1, 2003 have been the upgrading of an existing mill at Bruck in Austria for NOK260 million and the upgrading of a machine at Saugbrugs in Norway for NOK90 million.
We believe that, based on our current expectations regarding our results of operations and cash flow, our ability to borrow in the Norwegian and international capital markets and the expected proceeds of this offering, we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet all of our current and planned capital expenditures.
We issued shares in 1999 in connection with the merger of Union into us, in the first half of 2000 to finance the Fletcher Challenge Paper acquisition and in June 2001 to finance our acquisitions of an additional one-sixth interest in PanAsia and the Walsum and Parenco paper mills. At the end of June 30, 2003, our shareholders' equity was NOK19,646 million, including minority interests of NOK164 million, resulting in a shareholders' equity to assets ratio of 0.41.
We use the surplus cash flow generated by our operations mostly to repay loans. At June 30, 2003, we had assets of NOK47,513 million and consolidated interest-bearing liabilities of NOK20,017 million. As at June 30, 2003, our one-half portion of PanAsia's debt accounted for approximately 6.9% of our total debt. Our equity capital excluding minority interests increased by NOK1,718 million from NOK17,764 million at December 31, 2002 to NOK19,482 million at June 30, 2003 primarily due to exchange rate effects and to our sale of power generating assets during the first half of 2003. The increase in equity capital had a positive effect on our gearing ratio. Our gearing ratio (that is, the ratio of our net interest-bearing liabilities to shareholders' equity excluding minority interests) at the end of the first half of 2003 was 0.98 compared to 1.02 at the end of 2002. This represents an improvement of approximately 3.9%. Our target gearing ratio is 1.0 or less over a business cycle.
As a part of our long-term financing arrangements, we have several syndicated revolving credit facilities and term loan facilities. Among these are a syndicated 400 million multicurrency revolving credit facility with 96 million maturing in 2007 and 304 million maturing in 2009, and a syndicated U.S.$450 million multicurrency revolving credit facility with final maturity in 2005 and a syndicated loan facility of U.S.$90 million maturing in 2007. Several Nordic and international banks are participants in the facilities.
We have also established bilateral facilities totaling the equivalent of U.S.$210 million with three banks in Australasia and bilateral facilities totaling U.S.$90 million with three regional
34

banks in Chile. These facilities mature in three to four years. All these facilities permit drawings in a number of currencies. We have two syndicated term loans, one of which is a U.S.$187 million loan which matures in 2007 and the other of which is a 340 million loan which matures in 2009. In addition, we have several bilateral loans with Nordic Investment Bank maturing between 2005 to 2011. In addition, we have several additional small loan and credit facilities.
As of June 30, 2003, we have issued a total amount of NOK8,746 million in bonds. We have four outstanding domestic bonds, of which one has a floating interest rate at a margin of 0.95% over NIBOR. We had NOK500 million in domestic commercial paper outstanding as of June 30, 2003. In addition, in 2001, we raised U.S.$600 million through the issuance of 7.625% notes due 2011.

We sold our head offices located at Oksenøyveien 80, 1326 Lyaker, Norway during 2001, and currently rent the premises for an annual rental expense of NOK16 million. Under the terms of

35

the lease, we are entitled to terminate the lease after five or ten years, and have the option to purchase the property after 20 years. Other than as stated above, and in the notes to our financial statements, we do not have any material operating leases or capital lease obligations.
Risk Management
We are exposed to unforeseen events worldwide that may affect our results of operations. As a result, we have established an integrated company-wide risk management policy across functions and national boundaries in order to reduce this uncertainty.
We seek to create shareholder value by formulating an integrated company-wide risk management policy which anticipates changes in our financial, legal and business environment and allows us to better understand and prioritize risks that affect our business. Our company wide risk management is divided into four main categories: financial, hazard, operational and strategic risks. Our goal is to protect the company against unexpected losses, while securing stable earnings in order to create value for our shareholders.
We have established key functions, each of which is responsible for identifying, quantifying, analyzing and mitigating various risks in accordance with guidelines that have been approved by the Board of Directors. Responsibility for following up and monitoring company-wide risk management lies with our Corporate Risk Management department.
Currency Risk
Due to our position as one of the most international paper and pulp companies worldwide with a significant cost base in Norway, we incur significant costs in Norwegian kroner while our sales are predominantly in foreign currencies. As a result, we are exposed to a greater currency risk than most of our competitors.
We use various financial instruments to hedge this exposure, and seek at all times to hedge between 50% and 100% of our expected currency exposure during the coming year. The hedging instruments we use are forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options, currency swaps, interest rate swaps and loans denominated in foreign currencies.
In the first six months of 2003, the strengthening of the Norwegian kroner as compared to average foreign exchange rates in the first six months of 2002 had a negative impact on our operating earnings of approximately NOK167 million. However, translation differences on accounts receivables and payables had a positive impact of approximately NOK82 million. Our loss on hedging transactions related to cash flow was approximately NOK345 million during the first half of 2003.
We are exposed to currency risk in the following areas:
· Balance Sheet Risk, where assets and debt valued in foreign currencies have to be translated into Norwegian kroner on our balance sheet; and
· Transaction Risk, which arises as a result of our positive cash flow being predominantly in foreign currencies, while our negative cash flow is predominantly in Norwegian kroner.
Balance Sheet Risk
Balance sheet risk arises when our accounts are consolidated in Norwegian kroner and translation differences arise on assets and debt denominated in foreign currencies. The value of
36

our assets and debt are adjusted for this translation difference, thereby affecting important key ratios such as our gearing ratio (net interest-bearing debt to equity). Balance sheet risk is managed by ensuring that our net debt is denominated in a mix of currencies in which we also hold assets, in order to reduce fluctuations in key financial ratios resulting from currency rate movements. For practical reasons, we also use forward contracts to reduce our balance sheet risk.
We follow the requirements for hedge accounting under Norwegian GAAP.
The following table shows the balance sheet effect of changes in exchange rates during the six months ended June 30, 2003.

Transaction Risk
We are also exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations as a result of our cash flows in foreign currencies being translated into Norwegian kroner. Cash flows in foreign currencies consists of cash flow from operations, asset sales and investments, as well as cash flow related to financing activities. The value of expected future cash flows in Norwegian kroner is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.
Our policy is to hedge between 50% to 100% of the following 12-month period's expected net cash flow per currency. Our aim is to even out the effect of currency fluctuations on our cash flow and to make it easier to predict our future earnings. For additional information about exchange rate risks see ''Risk Factors--Risks Relating to our Business--Exchange rate fluctua tions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations''.

37

Interest Rate Risk
There is a correlation between economic trends and interest rate movements, with interest rates falling during an economic downturn and rising in an economic upswing. We seek to structure the fixing of interest rates on our loans in a manner so that interest costs partly offset changes in revenue as a consequence of changes in the economic climate. To a large extent, our loans have floating interest rates that are fixed for periods of less than one year. Limits are set for fixing interest rates per currency. We also use derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks.
The following table sets forth our net interest cost and our average rate of interest for the periods indicated.

Liquidity Risk
We have a policy of maintaining a minimum liquidity reserve of 20% of operating revenue, which as at June 30, 2003 amounted to NOK7,300 million. The liquidity reserve consists of available liquidity (cash and cash equivalents) as well as committed drawing facilities with banks. We maintain a minimum of NOK500 million in cash reserves that are held either in bank deposits or liquid securities. Our policy is to undertake transactions primarily with counterpar ties having high credit ratings. Counterparty credit limits are continuously monitored and reviewed.
Credit Risk
To manage the risk of losses on accounts payable, we have developed clear guidelines for credit control per customer. Internal credit ratings and credit lines are set for each customer, based on financial quality. In cases where the risk is high, credit insurance, or other hedging instruments, are considered where applicable.
Insurance
We have centralized the management of our group-wide insurance program. This program includes insurance policies, which cover property damage and business interruption, general liability and transportation. The insurance value of property damage and business interruption totaled NOK90,000 million at June 30, 2003. Total general liability cover amounted to NOK1,500 million. We seek to achieve the best insurance coverage based on competitive terms in the global insurance market. In addition, we aim to minimize the total cost of risk by, among other things, implementing risk-reducing activities. We seek to achieve an appropriate balance between retained insurable risks and risks that are transferred to the external insurance market.
Our business units are responsible for maintaining a high standard regarding all loss-prevention activities in accordance with our internal standards and procedures. Central support is offered
38

in identifying risks through comprehensive technical surveys. Among other things, these surveys form the basis for exchanging best practices between our different mills. Our insurance policies for property damage are underwritten by our fully-owned subsidiary, NSI Forsikring A/S, registered in Denmark. We are continuously evaluating our risk coverage through NSI Forsikring. In the longer term, we may decide to retain a higher degree of self insurance on property damage, which could result in lower premiums. We believe that we have historically maintained a relatively low level of claims under our insurance policies and, as a result, we believe our insurance premiums have been relatively low considering recently volatile insurance premiums. Project Risk We have invested in companies and projects worldwide. Risk is often related to the areas where these projects are located. We have developed a method for identifying and managing such risks. The risk of a project depends on a number of future events that may occur during a project's lifetime. We evaluate the risk of a project based on its impact on our cash flow and revenue. We believe this process provides us with an effective tool for ascertaining the riskreturn relationship for particular projects.

Our Business
General
We are one of the leading global publication paper companies. We are the second largest producer of newsprint and the third largest producer of magazine paper in the world based on production capacity as at June 30, 2003, with an annual production capacity of 6.2 million metric tonnes of newsprint and 1.7 million metric tonnes of magazine paper. Capacity for these purposes includes our proportionate share of our joint venture, PanAsia, and includes all of the capacity of NorskeCanada and Malaysian Newsprint Industries. We include all of the capacity of NorskeCanada and Malaysian Newsprint Industries (although we only own 30.6% and 33.65% of them, respectively, on the basis that we are the only paper company with a major interest in these entities. We are the parent company of the Norske Skogindustrier ASA group. Our headquarters are located in Oslo, Norway and through our subsidiaries, joint ventures and interests in other companies, we wholly or partly own mills in 15 countries on five continents.
While geographically diverse, we are strategically focused on the production, marketing and distribution of publication paper. Publication paper includes newsprint and magazine paper, and represented approximately 93% of our half year 2003 net sales. Our principal markets for our newsprint products are Europe, North America, Australasia, Asia and South America. In addition, we are present in North America as the largest shareholder in NorskeCanada. Our principal markets for our magazine paper products are Europe and North America.
In the last twelve years, we have grown from being a regional producer of a variety of paper, pulp and timber products to a global company focused on publication paper. During this period, we have divested nearly all units outside our core business and expanding our annual publication paper production capacity from 1.3 million metric tonnes in 1991 to 7.9 million metric tonnes as of June 30, 2003. We are focused on creating shareholder value by improving operating efficiencies, reducing purchasing, marketing and administrative costs and streamlin ing our organizational and corporate structure. See ''Our Business Strategy and Competitive Strengths--Revised Corporate Structure''.
Our total assets were NOK47.5 billion as at June 30, 2003, and for the six months ended June 30, 2003, we had operating revenue of NOK11,382 million and operating earnings of NOK685 million. As at September 1, 2003, our market capitalization was NOK16.5 billion.
Our business operates primarily in four geographic regions:
· Europe with nine wholly-owned paper mills in Norway, France, Austria, Germany, The Netherlands, and the Czech Republic.
· South America with two wholly-owned paper mills in Chile and Brazil.
· Australasia with three wholly-owned paper mills in Australia and New Zealand.
· Asia with our 50% interest in PanAsia, which currently has four paper mills in China, Korea and Thailand. PanAsia expects to complete construction of a second paper mill in China by 2005. We also have a 33.65% interest in Malaysian Newsprint Industries, a Malaysian newsprint producer operating one paper mill.
In addition, we have a significant minority stake of 30.6% in NorskeCanada, which has operations in North America comprising four publication paper mills in Canada (two of which also produce pulp). We have created a corporate management area that we call ''Partially
40

Owned Companies'' with operational responsibility for our interests in PanAsia, NorskeCanada, and Malaysian Newsprint Industries.
Our Business Strategy and Competitive Strengths
· Our vision is to continue to be a leading international company within the paper and forest products industry.
· Our goal is to create value for our shareholders, matching or exceeding the performance of the other leading paper and forest products companies.
As a measurement of this goal, we aim to achieve a return on capital employed of at least 13% throughout a business cycle. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
· Concentrate on our core publication paper business.
We believe that by concentrating our resources and capital on a narrow range of products, we have developed a high level of proficiency at manufacturing and a deep knowledge of our customer base and the market. We developed this strategy more than seven years ago and have systematically divested non-core assets, acquired strategic businesses involved in the production of publication papers and built new assets dedicated to the production of publication paper. In the first half of 2003, approximately 93% of our net sales were from publication paper compared to 64% in 1995.
· Continue to consolidate our global position.
We intend to maintain our position as one of the industry leaders in the paper and forest products industry. Our position as a leading global producer of publication papers will allow us to supply the needs of our global customers. We have largely completed an ambitious multi year program of acquisitions and divestitures and will seek to support future growth through a focus on achieving greater efficiencies in operations and in our corporate structure, and the continued evaluation of selected smaller acquisitions and new investment opportunities. In addition, we plan to build new production capacity only if there is sufficient demand to absorb the additional capacity.
· Cost-efficient production.
We strive to produce and supply our products on the most cost-efficient basis within each region where we compete. We expect to accomplish this goal by reducing our cost of production and by developing and focusing on the products we are able to produce most competitively. Reductions in our production costs should arise from economies of scale, continuous operational improvements, use of the lowest cost raw materials available within each region where we operate and cooperation among the regions to optimize trade flows. We may also make selected investments to achieve operational improvements. We continually evaluate the cost efficiency of our productive assets, and will consider replacing less efficient productive capacity with machines, mills and other producing assets of greater efficiency. If we do replace capacity, this may lead to accounting adjustments.
· Revised corporate structure.
As part of what we call our ''Improvement 2003'' program, we have revised aspects of our management structure by shortening reporting lines, devolving decision-making authority in sales and marketing to local sales offices (within the framework of guidelines set by central management) and by standardizing and further coordinating production methods and
41

centralizing production management, administration, procurement and logistics functions, where these are likely to benefit from a global corporate perspective. This program has allowed us to introduce cost-saving and efficiency measures across all our business lines and to better monitor and react to developments in our business environment. A goal of the program is to improve results (primarily through cost reduction measures) by NOK2 billion by the end of 2004 (measured against a baseline of our 2002 results and on a basis seeking to adjust for or exclude factors outside our control). As of June 30, 2003, we had achieved improvements of NOK320 million and believe we remain on course to achieve the targeted gain of NOK1 billion by year end.
These strategic aims are supported by what we see as our principal competitive strengths.
· Significant presence on five continents.
We have become one of the world's most global paper companies with mills in 15 countries and on five continents (which includes our joint venture PanAsia, our 33.65% interest in Malaysian Newsprint Industries and our 30.6% interest in NorskeCanada). We are the second largest publication paper producer globally based on production capacity and have a substantial market share in each of the regions in which we operate. Local presence gives us the ability to manage capacity on a regional basis, reducing the need for expensive transportation. Further, our proximity to our customers increases the potential for service agreements and integrated sales and distribution systems.
The following table sets forth our relative ranking and share of capacity for newsprint and magazine paper in our principal markets globally and by region as of June 30, 2003.

· Leading position in growing markets.

We have significantly enhanced our position in the fast growing regions of Asia (excluding Japan), through our holding in PanAsia, and in South America. In addition, we expect to achieve higher levels of profitability in these markets because of our modern paper machines, our low operating costs and our proximity to our customers. In the first half of 2003, we achieved operating margins before depreciation of 34.3% in South America and 24.5% at PanAsia, higher than any of the other regions in which we operate. In addition, PanAsia has recently announced the construction of a new mill in Hebei, China with a planned annual

42

capacity of 330,000 metric tonnes of newsprint, which will strengthen PanAsia's position in a market that has been experiencing a rapid growth in demand for newsprint in recent years and which we believe will continue to experience growth in demand.
· Low cost producer.
Based on our own internal cost benchmarking analysis, we believe our newsprint production ranks in either the first or second quartile in terms of delivered cash cost within each region in which we operate (the first quartile being the lowest delivered cash cost). We also believe our uncoated magazine paper and our coated magazine paper production rank, respectively, in the first and second quartiles in Europe in terms of their delivered cash cost.
· A focused company with an ability to realize efficiencies regionally and globally.
Over the past decade, our business has grown rapidly and we have become a global company focused on the production of publication papers. A significant amount of our growth has been attributed to the acquisition of several publication paper businesses. Our success in integrating these businesses into our existing operations has provided us with considerable experience, particularly with publication papers, and has demonstrated our ability to realize cost efficiencies and operational improvements both regionally and globally. We have utilized our experience gained in these integration efforts to create a set of best practice procedures in order to standardize practices across mills and enhance operational efficiency.
· Competitive assets.
From 1998 through 2000, we invested approximately NOK6,488 million in our production facilities, including investment in a new paper machine at our mill in Golbey, France at a cost of approximately NOK2.8 billion. During the last three years, our capital expenditure has been strictly prioritized and kept below 50% of depreciation. We intend to maintain a capital expenditure to depreciation ratio of approximately 50% to 70% in the longer term. Capital expenditure for these purposes includes current investments in maintenance and the upgrading of paper machines but excludes any strategic investments (including new paper machines) which we may make in the future. We expect that capital expenditure will continue to be financed from our operational cash flow.
Company History
We were founded in 1962 by the Norwegian forest owners association in cooperation with private and public interests. However, we can trace our roots back to the late nineteenth century to certain businesses that now form a part of our company. In 1966, we commenced production of newsprint at our first paper machine, a fully integrated newsprint mill located in Skogn, Norway and by 1989, we had become the sole newsprint producer in Norway, after leading the consolidation of the publication paper industry in Norway. During the 1990s, we began to expand our operations outside of Norway and into Europe. Since 1999, through acquisitions and the creation of joint ventures, we have become a global publication paper company, with operations in all the major paper producing regions of the world. At the same time as we have been expanding our operations, we have also been concentrating this expansion on our core areas of newsprint and magazine papers. As a result, we have sold non core operating units over the last several years.

Industry Overview
The paper products industry is an international, capital intensive and highly competitive industry with several large global producers and many smaller regional producers. The industry has grown at a rate similar to that of global general economic growth over the past two decades. The industry is characterized by volatile pricing and profitability caused by imbalances between supply and demand. Due to the large amount of capital required for the construction of new paper production capacity and the long lead-time required to plan and complete new production facilities, it is a challenge to adapt capacity levels to meet changing demand.
We believe the recent consolidation in the paper products industry provides a better balance between supply and demand globally, thus helping to reduce price volatility. During the past several years, the publication paper segment, which includes newsprint and magazine paper, has experienced the greatest amount of consolidation globally in comparison to other paper grades. Norske Skog's paper products are principally publication paper grades.
Paper is primarily comprised of pulp and fillers such as clay. Pulp can be produced from mechanically processed wood (resulting in mechanical pulp), from chemically processed wood (resulting in chemical pulp) or from processed waste paper (resulting in recycled pulp). Paper can be either uncoated, coated with a thin film made primarily of clay and machine polished to provide a glossy finish (calendered) or uncoated and calendered. Major grades of publication paper include newsprint, directory paper, uncoated magazine paper (supercalendered ''SC'' paper) and coated magazine paper (lightweight coated ''LWC'' paper). Paper grades that contain mainly chemical pulp include fine paper grades and some packaging paper.
Sources of wood for the production of pulp include logs, wood chips and sawdust from sawmills. Wood pulp can be made from softwood, such as pine or spruce, or hardwood, such as birch, aspen or eucalyptus. Softwood pulp contains long fibers, which add strength to paper. Hardwood pulp contains short fibers, which add bulk, opacity and smoothness to paper. Chemical pulp is generally produced through a process known as the sulphate or ''kraft'' process. Kraft pulp retains the strength of the wood fibers better than mechanical pulping. Because of the combination of long fibers and the chemical process, softwood kraft pulp is the strongest pulp available. Pulp may be either bleached to add brightness or unbleached.
Historically, newsprint has been considered a late cyclical paper grade where changes in pricing will lag behind changes in pulp and fine paper prices and has shown somewhat less price volatility than other paper grades. Similar to newsprint, magazine paper grades are also considered a late cyclical paper grade because changes in magazine paper prices generally lag behind changes in pulp and fine paper prices.
Locations of Operations
We operate our business primarily in four geographic regions. These regions are Europe, South America, Australasia and Asia, which includes our interests in PanAsia and Malaysian Newsprint Industries. In addition, we are the largest shareholder in NorskeCanada, which has operations in North America.

Europe
We are the third largest producer of newsprint in Europe based on annual production capacity and the third largest producer of magazine paper in Europe. Our operations in Europe accounted for 60.5% of our operating revenue and 73.4% of operating earnings in the first half of 2003. Our operations in Europe delivered 3,144 metric tonnes of publication paper in 2002 and 1,622 metric tonnes in the first half of 2003.
Production Facilities. We have nine paper mills in Europe located in Norway, France, Austria, Germany, The Netherlands, and the Czech Republic with an annual production capacity of 3.8 million metric tonnes including 2.3 million metric tonnes of newsprint and 1.5 million metric tones of uncoated magazine paper and coated magazine paper.
We believe our overall cost position is in the second quartile for newsprint, in the first quartile for uncoated magazine paper and in the second quartile for coated magazine paper production in terms of delivered cash cost per metric tonne to Frankfurt, Germany.

Raw Materials. The principal raw material used by our European operations is pulp, which is made from wood or waste paper such as old newspapers and old magazines.

In 2002, 41% of our wood requirements in Europe came from Norwegian timber, 29% from non-Norwegian timber and 31% from sawmills in the form of woodchips. Our timber purchases represented approximately 39% of the timber harvested in Norway in 2002. We purchase timber in Norway pursuant to one-year contracts. In Norway, we obtain waste paper through long-term contracts with local communities. At our other European paper mills we obtain waste paper from multiple sources in Central Europe.

The primary types of pulp we use for the production of publication paper are TMP, other types of mechanical pulp, recycled pulp and small amounts of chemical pulp. In 2002, we estimate that 65% of our European pulp requirements were met by internally produced TMP and other types of mechanical pulp, 30% by internally produced recycled pulp and 5% by chemical pulp purchased from third parties.

Sales and Distribution. Our operations in Europe generally sell their products to newspapers, publishing houses and printers. By sales, the top three countries for our products in Europe are Germany, the United Kingdom and France. These three countries together comprise 39% of our European operations' sales in 2003.

Our European operations sell their products directly to our customers through a sales force based in each of the countries in which we have significant sales. Exports from our European operations are sold by our sales agents and distributors outside of Europe.
We have a well-diversified customer base with our ten largest customers accounting for approximately 20% of our European operations' sales in 2002. Our price contracts with our newsprint customers, and most of our price contracts for uncoated magazine paper, are generally of a one-year duration.
Competition. The market for publication paper is highly competitive. Our principal competitors in Europe in newsprint include Stora Enso Oyj, UPM-Kymmene Oyj and Holmen AB. Our principal competitors in Europe in uncoated magazine paper include UPM-Kymmene, Stora Enso, M-real Corporation and Svenska Cellulosa AB SCA (publ). Our principal competitors in Europe in coated magazine paper include UPM-Kymmene, Stora Enso, M-real, Cartiere Burgo SpA, Sappi Limited and SCA.

South America
Our operations in South America are comprised of our 100% interest in the PISA newsprint mill in Brazil and our 100% interest in the Papeles Norske Skog Bio Bio, S.A. paper mill in Chile. Our operations in South America accounted for 4.8% of our operating revenue and 11.1% of our operating earnings in the first half of 2003. Our operations in South America delivered 155,000 metric tonnes of newsprint in the first half of 2003 and 330,000 metric tonnes in 2002. In 1999, we commenced operations under a 50% joint venture agreement with Klabin in Brazil for the production of newsprint. Following the termination on March 31, 2003 of our Norske Skog Klabin newsprint joint venture, we have been providing the customers of that mill with paper produced by our operations in Europe. The mill is now owned by Klabin and is no longer being used to produce newsprint. Thus, the mill is not in competition with our newsprint products in South America.
South America is a market in which there are only a few small domestic newsprint producers. We estimate domestic production is only able to supply about half the demand for newsprint in South America. Large North American newsprint producers compete with us to satisfy local demand. Our South American mills have a significant delivered cost advantage compared to our North American competitors due to their proximity to their customers and access to an ample supply of low-cost wood.
Production Facilities. We are the largest producer of newsprint in South America based on annual production capacity, with a total of 310,000 metric tonnes of newsprint production capacity from two paper mills.
48

We believe our Brazilian newsprint machine is in the first quartile and our Chilean newsprint paper machine is in the second quartile in terms of delivered cash cost per metric tonne to Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Raw Materials and Suppliers. PISA consumes approximately 350,000 cubic meters of wood and 9,000 of kraft pulp. Its supply of raw materials is maintained through long-term contracts with local suppliers.
PISA uses internally produced TMP and other types of mechanical pulp and purchases some chemical pulp from third parties. In 2002, 82% of PISA's pulp requirements were from TMP, 13% from other types of mechanical pulp and 5% from chemical pulp.
Bio Bio sources all of its wood requirements from third parties. As Bio Bio operates in a region of Chile that has a substantial surplus of pulpwood, much of which is exported, it is able to purchase its fiber requirements under short-term fiber supply contracts at local market prices. In 2002, almost all of Bio Bio's pulp requirements were from internally produced groundwood with a small percentage from chemical pulp purchased from third parties.
Sales and Distribution. Our operations in South America generally sell their products to newspaper and commercial printers across South America. In 2002, 99.4% of our products produced in South America were sold within South America. In 2002, the ten largest customers of our South American operations accounted for approximately 40% of its sales. By sales, the top two countries for our South American products are Brazil and Chile, which together comprised 81% of the sales of our operations in South America in 2002.
PISA's production is principally for the local Brazilian market with some minor exports to other South American countries. In Chile, Bio Bio produces newsprint and other publication paper grades for the local market and for export to Peru, Ecuador, Uruguay, Colombia, Paraguay, Argentina and Bolivia. The mill serves many of the major publishers in the region, with approximately 46% of production sold in Chile and the remainder sold in adjacent countries. Bio Bio has entered into short-term supply arrangements with a number of regional commercial and telephone directory publishers.
Competition. Competition among the South American producers of newsprint is limited, as they tend to be small and serve only customers in their surrounding area. Other South American producers include Empresas CMPC and Papel Prensa. However, our main competitors are Abitibi-Consolidated and Bowater Incorporated, who export newsprint from North America to South America.

49

Australasia
Our operations in Australasia are the only producers of newsprint in Australia and New Zealand. We have a market share of approximately 92% in Australia and 95% in New Zealand based on volume sold. Our operations in Australasia accounted for 16.5% of our operating revenue and 29.2% of our operating earnings in the first half of 2003. Our operations in Australasia sold 409,000 metric tonnes of newsprint in the first half of 2003 and 826,000 metric tonnes in 2002.
We have a unique market position in Australasia compared with the other regions of the world in which we operate. This is because we are the only domestic producer of newsprint and we have close integration with our customers. It is uneconomical, under most conditions, to ship newsprint to Australasia from the major newsprint producing regions of North America and Europe due to its geographic remoteness. Our production costs in Australasia are generally favorable compared to other regions.
Production Facilities. We have three paper mills in Australia and New Zealand with an annual production capacity of 945,000 metric tonnes of newsprint.
We believe our operations have the lowest delivered cash cost per metric tonne to Sydney, Australia of all our competitors. This is due to our access to an ample supply of virgin fiber, well-maintained assets, and a significant freight cost advantage due to the proximity of our mills to our customers compared to our principal competitors located in Asia. We acquired all of our Australasian mills from Fletcher Challenge Paper in July 2000.
The following table provides information on our production capacity and mills in Australasia as of June 30, 2003.

Raw Materials. The principal raw material used by our Australasian operations is pulp made from wood or waste paper. In 2002, 61% of our wood requirements in Australasia came from long-term contracts with third parties, 33% from market purchases and 6% from our own plantations.

The Albury mill acquired almost all of its wood from plantations in New South Wales and Victoria in 2002. It has long-term contracts with the state government of New South Wales and with private property owners. The largest of the contracts, representing 40% of the Albury mill's wood requirements, is with the state government of New South Wales and expires in 2015.

In 2002, the Boyer mill acquired approximately one-third of its wood requirements from its own estate, approximately one-half from Forestry Tasmania and Rayonier under long-term

50

supply agreements which expire in 2022, and the remainder from suppliers under short-term contracts of up to three years in duration.
The Tasman mill acquired a significant portion of its wood requirements from long-term contracts in 2002. Its principal contracts are with Fletcher Challenge Forests. The contracts expire in 2020.
Our operations in Australasia also purchase waste paper to produce recycled pulp at our Albury mill. Albury is relatively close to the two largest cities in Australia, Melbourne and Sydney, which provide a reliable supply of waste paper. Waste paper is supplied under contracts with terms of up to seven years, with prices protected by maximum and minimum price agreements.
The primary types of pulp used by our Australasian operations are TMP, other types of mechanical pulp, recycled pulp and chemical pulp. The majority of the pulp used by our Australasian operations is internally generated. In 2002, 75% of our Australasian pulp requirements were from TMP, 14% from recycled paper, 4% from chemical pulp and 7% from other types of mechanical pulp.
Sales and Distribution. Our operations in Australasia generally sell their products to newspapers and commercial printers of preprint advertising which are inserted into newspapers or delivered by other means. The principal markets for our Australasian products are Australia and New Zealand, which together accounted for 93% of sales in 2002, with some exports to Asia.
All of our Australasian products sold within Australia and the Pacific Islands are sold directly to our customers by our Australasian operations using their own sales force. PanAsia distributes Australasia's paper to customers in Asia.
Our Australian operations benefit from long-term business relationships with three of the major publishers in Australia through supply contracts extending through 2010. These publishers account for a significant majority of domestic newsprint demand and most of our sales and we supply almost all of their newsprint requirements. Prices under these contracts are fixed annually in Australian dollars using a formula based on a premium over U.S. west coast transaction prices for newsprint. In addition, annual price movements are restricted by a cap/collar arrangement.
Our New Zealand sales are made to the members of the New Zealand Newspaper Publishers Association (''NZNPA''), which includes nearly all of New Zealand's newspaper publishers, under one five-year contract. Two members of the NZNPA account for approximately 85% of total New Zealand newsprint demand and we supply all of their newsprint. Historically, prices negotiated with the NZNPA have been similar, but not equal, to the Australian newsprint prices as set under the contracts described above.
Competition. We are the only domestic producer of newsprint in Australia and New Zealand. Based on volume sold, we have approximately a 92% market share in newsprint in Australia and a 95% market share in newsprint in New Zealand. Only 75,000 metric tonnes, or 8% of Australian newsprint consumption, was imported into Australia in 2002, the majority of which was from Asia.
Partially Owned Companies
Asia
In Asia, we own 50% of PanAsia and 33.65% of Malaysian Newsprint Industries. PanAsia accounted for 10.0% of operating revenue and 19.6% of our operating earnings in the first
51

half of 2003. PanAsia delivered a total of 1,256,000 metric tonnes of newsprint in 2002 and 610,000 tonnes in the first half of 2003.
We believe that the four PanAsia mills are the premier newsprint assets in Asia (excluding Japan) and are among the lowest cost production facilities in the world. The average age of the newsprint machines at the mills is approximately nine years. The PanAsia mills are strategically located in a region which we believe will have one of the highest long-term growth rates for newsprint demand in the world.
We own 33.65% of Malaysian Newsprint Industries with the balance owned by three Malaysian groups, two of which are publishers. We account for Malaysian Newsprint Industries as an equity investment in our financial statements.
Production Facilities. PanAsia is the largest producer of publication paper in Asia (excluding Japan) based on annual production capacity and controls four paper mills located in Korea, China, and Thailand with the capacity to produce 1,460,000 metric tonnes of newsprint and groundwood specialty paper. Malaysian Newsprint Industries has one mill located in Malaysia with the capacity to produce 250,000 metric tonnes of newsprint.
We believe PanAsia's newsprint operations are among the lowest cost production facilities in the world, in terms of delivered cash cost per metric tonne to Hong Kong, China.

(1) To calculate our total production capacity in Asia, we include our proportionate share of the capacity of PanAsia (as we share the ownership of PanAsia equally with Abitibi Consolidated, a major paper producing company) and all of the capacity of Malaysian Newsprint Industries (although we only own 33.65% of it) on the basis that we are the only paper company with a major interest in this entity.

New mill in China. PanAsia announced in September 2003 the creation of a joint venture with Hebei Longteng Paper Corporation of China to build and operate a newsprint paper mill in Zhaoxian, located in the Hebei province of China, 280 kilometers south-west of Beijing. PanAsia will have a 65% equity stake and Longteng the remaining 35%. The total investment cost for

52

the project is expected to be approximately U.S.$300 million (which equals less than $1,000 per metric tonne at full production capacity), with PanAsia's share of the equity amounting to approximately U.S.$70 million. PanAsia will also consolidate the full amount of the project's debt, amounting to approximately U.S.$200 million. The project will be consolidated as a subsidiary in PanAsia's accounts, with proportional consolidation in our accounts. The impact on our balance sheet is expected to be limited, with an increase in total assets of approximately NOK1.1 billion and an estimated increase in the net debt to equity ratio of 0.04. We expect the equity to be financed from PanAsia's own cash flow, without any need for a capital injection from us. Construction of the mill is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2003 and the mill is expected to begin production during the third quarter of 2005, eventually reaching full capacity of 330,000 metric tonnes per year. The newsprint produced at the mill will contain 100% recycled fiber. This project is an integral part of our strategy to expand PanAsia's newsprint operations in China, which has seen a rapid growth in newsprint demand in recent years. According to the Pulp and Paper Products Council, demand has risen from 1.15 million metric tonnes in 1998 to nearly 1.8 million metric tonnes in 2002. Management believes that China should continue to experience significant annual growth in newsprint demand.
Raw Materials. The principal raw material for PanAsia and Malaysian Newsprint Industries is pulp made from waste paper and wood. In 2002, more than 90% of our Asian pulp requirements came from waste paper and wood and less than 10% from TMP and CTMP.
PanAsia's Jeonju mill uses approximately 90% recycled pulp and 10% TMP and CTMP and the other PanAsia mills use close to 100% recycled pulp to produce their newsprint. Approximately 50% of the waste paper is sourced domestically pursuant to short-term contracts with the balance imported from the United States, Europe and Japan. The Korean mills have access to the waste paper market in Korea, which is one of the largest and lowest-cost sources of waste paper in Asia, making these mills among the lowest cost in the world. In contrast, less waste paper is collected in China and Thailand and our mills there must rely more on imported waste paper, with the SingBuri mill importing all of its waste paper and the Shanghai mill importing approximately 90% of its requirements.
Malaysian Newsprint Industries uses only recycled pulp. Malaysian Newsprint Industries is the only newsprint mill in Malaysia, and sources approximately 50% of its raw material requirements from domestic supplies of waste paper, with the balance being imported.
Sales and Distribution. PanAsia and Malaysian Newsprint Industries generally sell their products to newspaper publishers and commercial printers across Asia. In the first half of 2003, 90% of PanAsia's sales were within Asia and 10% were to the rest of the world. Malaysian Newsprint Industries sells all of its products within Asia. By sales, the top three countries for our Asian operations' products are Korea, Malaysia and China, which together comprised 75% of sales volumes in 2002.
Over the last fifteen years, Asia (excluding Japan) has experienced growth in demand for newsprint of between 6% and 7% per year, one of the fastest growth rates of any region in the world. We believe this trend is likely to continue in the long run due to rising literacy rates and increasing wealth and disposable income in the region.
PanAsia functions as an independent operation with regard to the production and marketing of its products within a market area consisting of the Asia-Pacific region and the Indian subcontinent. The joint venture agreement provides for PanAsia to distribute products from its joint venture partners within the market area and for the joint venture partners to distribute
53

PanAsia products within their respective regions of the world. We are responsible for distribution of PanAsia's products in Europe, Africa and the Middle East while AbitibiConsolidated is responsible for distribution of these products in North America and South America.
In 2002, the ten largest customers of PanAsia accounted for approximately 40% of its sales.
Malaysian Newsprint Industries' principal market is Malaysia with some sales to Singapore and some export volumes to other parts of Asia. In 2002, Malaysian Newsprint Industries' shares of the Malaysia and Singapore newsprint markets was 75% and 24%, respectively. In Malaysia, five leading publishing groups represent over 74% of the demand for newsprint. Two of these publishing groups are direct shareholders of Malaysian Newsprint Industries and represent 25% of the demand for newsprint in Malaysia. These shareholders and another publisher have contracts with Malaysian Newsprint Industries to purchase 100,000 metric tonnes of Malaysian Newsprint Industries' production each year. This is equal to approximately 40% of Malaysian Newsprint Industries' annual production.
Competition. Our principal competitors in Asia include PT Aspex Paper, Guangzhou Paper, Nanping Paper, Tipco and Bowater. Holmen and UPM-Kymmene also sell some newsprint on the spot market in Asia.
NorskeCanada
NorskeCanada, of which we own 30.6%, is the third largest producer of newsprint and groundwood specialty paper in North America based on annual production capacity. NorskeCanada is based in Vancouver and its shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. NorskeCanada is the trade name of Norske Skog Canada Ltd.
Production Facilities. NorskeCanada operates four pulp and paper mills located in British Columbia, Canada producing 1,850,000 metric tonnes of newsprint, directory, uncoated groundwood and magazine paper, 410,000 metric tonnes of market pulp and 115,000 metric tonnes of kraft paper. The four mills have three paper machines each. Elk Falls and Crofton also produce kraft pulp and kraft paper is made at Elk Falls. NorskeCanada has entered into a strategic alliance with Norske Skog which includes operational cooperation in areas such as knowledge sharing networks, technical benchmarking and product development.
Raw Materials. NorskeCanada's fiber supply comes primarily from residual wood chips and sawdust from lumber operations and secondarily from the chipping of pulp logs.
Sales and Distribution. The principal customers for NorskeCanada's papers are newspaper publishers, commercial printers and telephone directory publishers located primarily in western and central North America and the North Pacific Rim. For the year ended December 31, 2002, publication paper accounted for 80% of NorskeCanada's net sales.
NorskeCanada's primary pulp customers include manufacturers of coated paper, wood-free printing and writing papers, tissue, towelling and sanitary products. Containerboard produced by Elk Falls is sold primarily to corrugated box plants located in western Canada and the western United States. For the year ended December 31, 2002, pulp and containerboard accounted for 20% of NorskeCanada's consolidated net sales.
NorskeCanada has entered into a strategic alliance with Norske Skog regarding sales and marketing of specialty and magazine paper in North America. Through a jointly owned legal entity, Norske Skog North America Inc., the two companies market groundwood specialty
54

paper throughout North America. NorskeCanada also has a distribution agreement with PanAsia similar to the agreement between Norske Skog and PanAsia. Under the agreement, PanAsia distributes NorskeCanada's exports to the Asian market. NorskeCanada has a similar distribution agreement with Norske Skog for sales from Canada to South America.
No single customer accounts for more than 10% of NorskeCanada's consolidated net sales. A significant majority of NorskeCanada's sales are made into the United States.
Competition. The North American market for newsprint is the largest in the world and is highly competitive. Norske Skog's principal competitors in the North American newsprint market include Abitibi-Consolidated, Bowater and Kruger, as well as regional competitors in western North America such as North Pacific Paper Corp.
Transportation. NorskeCanada ships paper primarily by deep sea vessel, and for inland destinations by a combination of ship, barge, rail and truck. Each of Crofton, Elk Falls, Port Alberni and Powell River mills have their own deep sea docks.
Revised Corporate Structure
In 2003, as part of what we call our ''Improvement 2003'' program, we undertook a major reorganization of our corporate management structure to provide direct lines of access between management and our operating units. The new corporate management structure divides these new centralized and standardized operations along the following lines: production, sales and marketing, and supply and logistics.
Sales and Marketing
We have eliminated layers of management, creating a ''flatter'' management structure which provides more direct lines of communication between our sales force on the ground in various European countries and the head office in Norway. We have also devolved authority for many of the decisions regarding a sales contract to local offices, while the head office remains responsible for the overall strategy and for establishing targets for the sales and marketing division. In addition, we have centralized certain administrative functions formerly the responsibility of local and regional sale offices, leaving the sales offices free to concentrate their efforts on our customers. This new system has allowed us to standardize procedures, while preserving flexibility at the local level to adjust to specific situations, and to provide a response in a shorter time to customers, thereby providing a higher quality of service to them.
Production
Our new management structure also features a more centralized product management group which is primarily responsible for determining the best means of producing the product for the customer, including where to produce the product, how best to produce it and how quickly deliveries can be made to the customer. Eliminating layers of management facilitates communication and coordination between this central production management group and production facilities, and enables us to standardize its operating procedures, thereby creating significant efficiencies. At the same time, by providing direct access to senior management, we have ensured that any major issues will be brought promptly to the attention of the appropriate senior manager.
55

Supply and Logistics
In connection with our reorganization of our production and our sales and marketing groups, we have also centralized the operations of our supply and logistics team. This group focuses on ensuring timely delivery of our products to our customers and on assisting with procuring the appropriate category and quantities of raw material for the mills. They work closely with the product management group and the mills to provide an efficient service to the customer. As with our other revised corporate management groups, the removal of a layer of management has allowed for a greater standardization of our procedures across Europe and for prompt access to senior management in Norway when necessary.

Employees
At June 30, 2003, we had 7,607 permanent employees (excluding PanAsia, Malaysian Newsprint Industries and NorskeCanada). PanAsia had 1,698 permanent employees, Malaysian Newsprint Industries had 350 permanent employees and NorskeCanada had 3,927 permanent employees. The following table provides details of our employees by business regions (excluding PanAsia, Malaysian Newsprint Industries and NorskeCanada) as of June 30, 2003.

Our mill workers are unionized in all the countries in which we operate, except for Korea. We have not experienced any major strikes in recent years. However, as a result of our decision to implement our Improvement 2003 program, we experienced limited strike activities at our Golbey mill in the spring of 2003. This strike only lasted a total of 30 hours and did not have a material adverse effect on our operations for the first half of 2003. We have undertaken extensive discussions with all of our unions globally prior to the implementation of the Improvement 2003 program and we do not expect further industrial action relating to our implementation of this program.
We believe that our relationship with all of the unions representing our employees are generally good.

Environmental
The pulp and paper production process generates effluent containing organic compounds and nutrients, which can lead to eutrophication and a lack of oxygen in vulnerable water environments. In addition, most of our paper mills generate air emissions. The air emissions are mainly the result of energy production from the burning of biofuel and fossil fuel. The main air emissions are sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulate (ash and dust), in addition to carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuel.
With the exception of the Bio Bio and Boyer mills, all of our mills have biological waste water treatment plants that remove organic compounds from the waste water and significantly

56

reduce the amount of such compounds in the waste water before it is discharged into a river or other body of water. At the Boyer mill, the Australian authorities have set January 1, 2007 as the deadline for further measures to reduce discharges. At Bio Bio, a new mechanical wastewater treatment plant (sedimentation) came on-line in May 2003. This reduced the discharges of fiber by 85% and also significantly reduced the discharges of dissolved organic material. By these measures, Bio Bio is ready to meet new Chilean national discharge requirements well before they take effect in 2005. Most of our mills also have treatment facilities to remove contaminants from emissions to air.
Particulate from boilers is the main cause of local emissions to the air from Norske Skog's paper mills. Apart from Bio Bio in Chile, all the mills have filters that keep these emissions at very low levels. At present, Bio Bio is not subject to requirements limiting boiler particulate emissions. However, the mill has decided to invest in a new electrostatic filter to reduce emissions by 2005.
Due to the global geographic spread of our mills, our production operations are subject to a variety of environmental regulations at all levels of government. We have established a written policy regarding the environment which recognizes the environmental responsibility connected with industrial activity. We believe our operations are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
As part of our environmental policy, it is our aim that all of our production units should have certified environmental management systems. At present, eight of our 14 mills are certified in accordance with the ISO 14001 standard. The remaining mills are in the process of pursuing such certification and we anticipate receiving such certification before the end of 2003.
Our partly-owned mills in NorskeCanada and PanAsia operate in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. All NorskeCanada mills have environmental management systems according to the ISO 14001 standard. Our implementation of the above-described measures has led to further improvements in our overall environmental situation in 2002 and the first half of 2003.
Research and Development
We have given research and development a high priority in recent years. As part of the Improvement 2003 process our research and development group in Australasia was merged with our research and development group in Europe. We have increased staffing in our research and development group, particularly with people having production experience. Our research and development group now consists of approximately 60 employees. We have groups of research experts at ten of our paper mills and at our headquarters in Oslo. The research and development activities have been organized to optimize cooperation with production personnel and to be in close proximity to the operations of our mills.
We have specialists in the areas of fiber technology, paper production and characterisation, process chemistry, surface coating and runnability and printability of our products at our customers' printshops. Our experts work closely with our customers and suppliers and with research institutes and universities around the world. In recent years, we have also focused on the use of recovered paper and in particular on the environmental impacts of the raw materials, processes and products that are used at our mills.
57

Ownership of Partially Owned Companies
Our Partially Owned Companies corporate management entity is comprised of our 50% interest in PanAsia, our 30.6% interest in NorskeCanada, and our 33.65% interest in Malaysia Newsprint Industries.
PanAsia
PanAsia was formed in February 1999 as a joint venture between us, Abitibi-Consolidated of Canada and Hansol Paper of Korea. Each of the joint venture partners had a one-third interest in PanAsia. In August 2001, Hansol Paper sold its entire one-third stake in PanAsia to us and Abitibi-Consolidated. As a result, we and Abitibi-Consolidated currently each own 50% of PanAsia. For accounting purposes we historically consolidated one-third of PanAsia's financial results. Following our acquisition of an additional one-sixth interest in PanAsia, we have consolidated 50% of PanAsia's financial results.
Under our joint venture agreement, we have no ongoing financial commitments to PanAsia. PanAsia has an independent board of directors, on which we have three of the six seats.
The PanAsia joint venture partners are party to a shareholders agreement which provides that if any joint venture partner makes an acquisition of a business that produces publication papers within the ''Market Area'' of PanAsia (as defined in the shareholders agreement), PanAsia has the right to acquire these assets. The Market Area generally includes the AsiaPacific region and the Indian subcontinent, but does not include Australia or New Zealand. Our interest in Malaysian Newsprint Industries is affected by this provision. PanAsia has an ongoing right to purchase our shares in Malaysian Newsprint Industries at an agreed price.
NorskeCanada
Prior to the reorganization of NorskeCanada in 2001, we owned 50.8% of its shares. Since the acquisition of Pacifica Papers in August 2001 and an equity issue in May 2002, we now own 30.6% of the shares of NorskeCanada. We continue to be able to nominate and elect three directors to the board of directors of NorskeCanada, of which one serves as chairman. Our aim is to benefit from our future relationship with NorskeCanada through strategic alliances in areas such as supply and procurement, sales and marketing, and production and joint product development.
Malaysian Newsprint Industries
We own 33.65% of Malaysian Newsprint Industries, with the balance owned by three Malaysian groups, two of which are publishers. We acquired our share of Malaysian Newsprint Industries as part of the acquisition of Fletcher Challenge Paper in July 2000. We have three seats on the Board of Directors. The Hong Leong group of Malaysia provides management services to Malaysian Newsprint Industries. We are the only publication paper producer with a significant interest in Malaysian Newsprint Industries. Malaysian Newsprint Industries is the only domestic newsprint producer in Malaysia and sells most of it output to Malaysia and Singapore. The company's single paper machine mill started operations in 1999 and has an annual production capacity of 250,000 metric tonnes.
58

Transportation
We typically transport our products by various means, including by sea, truck and rail. We ship products from our Norwegian mills primarily using coastline ports which are equipped with modern deep sea docks. Products from our other European mills are transported and distributed on the European continent primarily by truck.
Paper produced by our operations in Australasia and South America is almost all sold domestically and is therefore generally transported by truck and rail.
Generally, PanAsia transports its domestic production by truck or ship and its international production by a combination of rail, truck and ship.
Energy
Energy is one of our most significant input factors, accounting for 26.0% of our variable production costs in the first half of 2003 and 26.2% of our variable production costs in 2002.
Europe
The total energy costs of our European operations was approximately NOK1,614 million in 2002 or approximately 26.9% of our variable costs. In Norway, we have entered into contracts securing all of our energy requirements up to 2010 and 95% of those requirements from 2010 to 2020. This long-term contract has limited price flexibility and therefore reduces cost variations associated with changing electricity prices. We obtained 100% of our energy requirements in Norway in 2002 through hydro power plants. Our operations in France obtain their energy requirements from foreign suppliers, while our operations in the Czech Republic obtain their energy requirements from domestic suppliers. Our operations in Austria own a natural gas fired co-generation plant. Our operations in Germany obtain their energy requirements from domestic suppliers and our operations in The Netherlands also obtain their energy requirements from a domestic supplier.
South America
Our operations in South America source most of their energy needs from the burning of waste wood and also from purchased electricity. PISA has a long-term electricity supply contract extending through 2006 and Bio Bio has an electricity supply agreement extending through 2008. In Chile, 20% of the electricity is produced from onsite generation.
Australasia
The main energy sources used in New Zealand are electrical energy, geothermal energy, natural gas and energy generated from the chemical recovery process and sawmill waste. The Tasman mill presently satisfies approximately 85% of its electricity needs through a series of hedge contracts with terms from three months to three years, and purchases the remainder of its electricity at spot prices. The main energy sources of the Australian mills are natural gas, fuel oil, coal and electricity. The Boyer mill has a long-term electricity supply contract through 2004 and the Albury mill has a long-term electricity supply contract which runs until 2007.
Asia
All of PanAsia's mills are connected to the public grid, which covers more than 60% of PanAsia's electricity supply. The balance is generated by the mills and is based on oil and
59

energy generated from waste products. Malaysian Newsprint Industries provides all of its own energy needs through its own combined heat and power gas cogeneration facility which is based on oil.
Legal Proceedings
We are a party to a small number of legal proceedings. None of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition taking into account insurance coverage and provisions made for the exposures.
60

(a) any such Tax which would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between such holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of such holder, if such Noteholder is an estate, a trust, a partnership or a corporation) and the Kingdom of Norway or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, including, without limitation, such Noteholder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder) being or having been a citizen or resident thereof or being or having been engaged in a trade or business or present therein or having, or having had, a permanent establishment therein; or
(b) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or personal property tax or any similar Tax; or
(c) any Tax which is payable otherwise than by withholding from payments on or in respect of any Note; or

(e) where such withholding or deduction is imposed on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to any European Union Directive on the taxation of savings implementing the conclusions of the European Union Economic and Finance Ministers (''ECOFIN'') Council Meeting of November 26-27, 2000 or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive; or

77

(g) where (in the case of a payment of principal or interest on redemption) the relevant Note Certificate is surrendered for payment more than 30 days after the Relevant Date except to the extent that such withholding or deduction would have been imposed, and the relevant Holder would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts, if it had surrendered the relevant Note Certificate or received a payment on the last day of such period of 30 days.
In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment on a Note to a Noteholder who is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent such payment would be required to be included in the income, for tax purposes, of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the holder of the Note.
In these Conditions, ''Relevant Date'' means whichever is the later of (a) the date on which the payment in question first becomes due and (b) if the full amount payable has not been received in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York by the Fiscal Agent on or prior to such due date, the date on which (the full amount having been so received) notice to that effect has been given to the Noteholders.
Any reference in these Conditions to principal or interest shall be deemed to include any additional amounts in respect of principal or interest (as the case may be) which may be payable under this Condition 9 (Taxation).

Pursuant to the terms of the Agency Agreement, the Issuer reserves the right at any time to vary or terminate the appointment of any Agent and to appoint a successor registrar, fiscal agent and additional or successor paying agents and transfer agents; provided, however, that the Issuer shall at all times maintain (a) a fiscal agent and a registrar, (b) a paying agent and transfer agent in Luxembourg, and (c) if the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26-27, 2000 take effect and are applied in a member state of the European Union, a Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to any European Union Directive on the taxation of savings implementing such conclusions or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced to conform to, such Directive.
Notice of any change in any of the Agents or in their Specified Offices shall promptly be given to the Noteholders.
14. Amendments
(a) Amendments without Noteholders' Consent. Without the consent of any Noteholders, the Issuer may, at any time and from time to time, amend these Conditions or the Notes:
(i) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer and the assumption by any such successor of the obligations of the Issuer under these Conditions or the Notes; or
81

(ii) to add to these Conditions for the benefit of the Noteholders or to surrender any right or power in these Conditions; or
(iii) to add any additional Events of Default for the benefit of the Noteholders; or
(iv) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any Condition which may be defective or inconsistent with any other Condition, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under these Conditions, provided that such action pursuant to this Condition 14(a)(iv) shall not adversely affect the interests of the Noteholders in any material respect; or
(v) to make any other change that does not adversely affect the interests of the Noteholders.
(b) Amendments with Noteholders' Consent. With the consent of the Noteholders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, the Issuer may amend these Conditions or the Notes for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of these Conditions or the Notes or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders; provided, however, that no such amendment shall, without the consent of the Noteholder of each outstanding Note:
(i) change the stated maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Note, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of the Notes that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof following an Event of Default, or change any place of payment where, or the currency in which the Notes or any premium or interest thereon is payable, or to impair the right of the Noteholders to institute suit for the enforcement of the Notes; or

(c) Noteholder Meetings. The provisions of Clause 10 of the Agency Agreement shall govern the manner by which meetings of Noteholders are convened.
15. Further Issues
The Issuer may from time to time, without the consent of the Noteholders, create and issue further notes having the same terms and conditions as the Notes in all respects (or in all respects except for the first payment of interest) so as to form a single series with the Notes. Holders should note that additional notes that are treated for non-tax purposes as a single series with the original notes may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, the new notes may be considered to have been issued with "original issue discount" (as defined under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations issued thereunder), which may affect the market value o f the original notes since such additional notes may not be distinguishable from the original notes.
82

16. Notices
Notices to the Noteholders will be sent to them by first class mail (or its equivalent) or (if posted to an overseas address) by airmail at their respective addresses on the Register. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the fourth day after the date of mailing. In addition, so long as Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of that Exchange so require, notices to Noteholders will be published on the date of such mailing in a daily newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, if such publication is not practicable, in a leading English language daily newspaper having general circulation in Europe.
17. Provision of Information
The Issuer shall, during any period in which it is not subject to and in compliance with the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ''Exchange Act'') nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act, duly provide to any Holder of a Note which is a ''restricted security'' within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act or to any prospective purchaser of such securities designated by such Holder, upon the written request of such Holder or (as the case may be) prospective Holder addressed to the Issuer and delivered to the Issuer or to the Specified Office of the Registrar, the information specified in Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.
18. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
(a) Governing Law: The Notes are governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
(b) Jurisdiction o f New York Courts: The Issuer agrees for the benefit of the Noteholders that the courts of the State of New York and any United States federal court, in each case sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York, United States, shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any suit, action or proceeding which may arise out of or in connection with the Notes (''Proceedings'') and, for such purposes, irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts.
(c) Appropriate Forum: The Issuer irrevocably waives any objection which it might now or hereafter have to the courts referred to in Condition 18(b) (Jurisdiction o f New York Courts) being nominated as the forum to hear and determine any Proceedings, and agrees not to claim that any such court is not a convenient or appropriate forum.
(d) Process Agent: The Issuer has appointed CT Corporation System at 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10011, United States (or, if different, its principal place of business in the City of New York for the time being) as its authorized agent upon whom process may be served in any Proceedings in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York. If such person ceases to be effectively appointed to accept service of process on the Issuer's behalf, the Issuer shall, on the written demand of any Noteholder addressed to the Issuer and delivered to the Issuer or to the Specified Office of the Fiscal Agent, appoint a further person in The City of New York to accept service of process on its behalf and, failing such appointment within 15 days, any Noteholder shall be entitled to appoint such a person by written notice addressed to the Issuer and delivered to the Issuer or to the Specified Office of the Fiscal Agent. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the right of any Noteholder to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
83

(e) Judgment Currency: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the obligations of the Issuer in respect of any amount due under the Notes shall, notwithstanding any payment in any other currency (whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise), be discharged only to the extent of the amount in U.S. dollars that the person entitled to receive such payment may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase with the sum paid in such other currency (after any premium and costs of exchange) on the business day immediately following the day on which such person receives such payment. If the amount in U.S. dollars that may be so purchased for any reason falls short of the amount originally due, the Issuer shall pay such additional amounts, in U.S. dollars, as may be necessary to compensate for such shortfall. Any obligation of the Issuer not discharged by such payment shall be due as a separate and independent obligation and until discharged as provided herein, shall continue in full force and effect. (f) Non-exclusivity: The submission to the personal jurisdiction of the courts referred to in Condition 18(b) (Jurisdiction o f New York Courts) shall not (and shall not be construed so as to) limit the right of any Noteholder to take Proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction, nor shall the taking of Proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not) if and to the extent permitted by law. (g) Waiver o f Immunity: To the extent that the Issuer may in any jurisdiction claim for itself or its assets or revenues immunity from suit, execution, attachment (whether in aid of execution, before judgment or otherwise) or other legal process and to the extent that such immunity (whether or not claimed) may be attributed in any such jurisdiction to the Issuer or its assets or revenues, the Issuer agrees not to claim and irrevocably waives such immunity to the full extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdiction and, in particular, to the intent that in any proceedings taken in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York the foregoing waiver of immunity shall have the fullest scope permitted under the United States Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 and is intended to be irrevocable for the purposes of such act.

The Restricted Global Note Certificates (and any Individual Note Certificates issued in exchange therefor) will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer as described below under ''--Transfer Restrictions''.
Transfer Restrictions
On or prior to the fortieth day after the Closing Date, Notes represented by an interest in an Unrestricted Global Note Certificate may be transferred to a person who wishes to hold such Notes in the form of an interest in such Restricted Global Note Certificate only upon receipt by the Registrar of a written certification from the transferor (in the form set out in Schedule 7 (Form o f Transfer Certificate) to the relevant Agency Agreement) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A, in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state
85

of the United States. After such fortieth day, such certification requirements will no longer apply to such transfer, but such transfers will continue to be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on the face of such Global Note Certificate, as described below under ''--Exchange of Interest in Global Note Certificates for Individual Note Certificates".

Any interest in either the Restricted Global Note Certificates or the Unrestricted Global Note Certificates that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note Certificate will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note Certificate and become an interest in the other Global Note Certificate and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to an interest in such other Global Note Certificate.
The Notes are being offered and sold in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers within the meaning of and in reliance on Rule 144A.
Each purchaser of Notes offered pursuant to Rule l44A will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows (terms used in the following paragraphs that are defined in Rule l44A have the respective meanings given to them in Rule 144A):
(a) the purchaser (i) is a qualified institutional buyer, (ii) is acquiring the Notes for its own account or for the account of such a qualified institutional buyer and (iii) is aware that the sale of the Notes to it is being made in reliance on Rule 144A;
(b) the purchaser understands that the Notes are being offered only in a transaction not involving any public offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act and that the Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be reoffered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with the legend set forth below; and
(c) the purchaser understands that the Restricted Global Note Certificates and any Restricted Individual Note Certificates (as defined below) will bear a legend to the following effect, unless the Issuer determined otherwise in accordance with applicable law:
THE NOTES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE ''SECURITIES ACT'') OR ANY SECURITIES LAW OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE HOLDER HEREOF, BY PURCHASING THE NOTES REPRESENTED HEREBY, AGREES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ISSUER THAT THE NOTES REPRE SENTED HEREBY MAY BE REOFFERED, RESOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED ONLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND OTHER APPLICABLE LAWS AND ONLY
86

(a) PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT TO A PERSON THAT THE HOLDER REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144A PURCHASING FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR A PERSON PURCHASING FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER WHOM THE HOLDER HAS INFORMED, IN EACH CASE, THAT THE REOFFER, RESALE, PLEDGE OR OTHER TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A, (b) IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 903 OR 904 OF REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (c) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION PROVIDED BY RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (IF AVAILABLE) OR (d) TO THE ISSUER OR ITS AFFILIATES.
Upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of a Restricted Global Note Certificate or a Restricted Individual Note Certificate bearing the above legend, or upon specific request for removal of the legend, the Issuer will deliver only Individual Note Certificates that bear such legend (''Restricted Individual Note Certificates'') or will refuse to remove such legend, unless there is delivered to the Issuer and the Registrar such satisfactory evidence (which may include a legal opinion) as may reasonably be required by the Issuer that neither the legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act. Such transfer restrictions will terminate two years after the Closing Date provided that any Notes purchased by or on behalf of the Issuer or any of its affiliates and surrendered for cancellation have been cancelled in accordance with Condition 7(i) (Redemp tion and Purchase--Cancellation).
(d) (i) either that (1) it is not, and for so long as it holds Notes, it is not acting on behalf of, an employee benefit plan or other plan subject to the prohibited transaction provisions of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (''ERISA''), or Section 4975 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (''Code''), or any entity whose underlying assets include the assets of any such plan, or a governmental, church or other employee benefit plan which is subject to any federal, state, local or foreign law that is substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and no part of the assets to be used by it to purchase and hold such Notes or any interest therein constitutes the assets of any such employee benefit plan or plan, or (2) its purchase, holding and disposition of the Notes does not and will not constitute or otherwise result in a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or section 4975 of the Code (or in the case of such a governmental, church or other employee benefit plan, a violation of any substantially similar federal, state, local or foreign law) for which an exemption is not available; and (ii) it agrees not to sell or otherwise transfer any interest in the Notes otherwise than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed to make these same representations, warranties and agreements with respect to its purchase, holding and disposition of the Notes.
For purposes of chapter VI, Article 3, point A/II/2 of the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange the notes are freely transferable and therefore no transaction made on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange may be cancelled.
Exchange of Interests in Global Note Certificates for Individual Note Certificates
Registration of title to Notes initially represented by the Global Note Certificates in a name other than DTC or a successor depositary or one of their respective nominees will not be permitted unless (a) such depositary notifies the Issuer that it is no longer willing or able to
87

discharge properly its responsibilities as depositary with respect to the relevant Global Note Certificate or ceases to be a clearing agency (as defined in the Exchange Act), or is at any time no longer eligible to act as such, and the Issuer is (in the case of it ceasing to be a depositary) unable to locate a qualified successor within 90 days of receiving notice of such ineligibility on the part of such depositary or (b) any of the circumstances described in Condition 10 (Events of Default) occurs or (c) (in the case of the Unrestricted Global Note Certificates only) Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is closed for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of legal holidays) or announces an intention permanently to cease business.
In such circumstances, the Issuer shall procure the delivery of Individual Note Certificates in exchange for the Unrestricted Global Note Certificates and/or the Restricted Global Note Certificates. A person having an interest in a Global Note Certificates must provide the Registrar (through DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg) with (i) such information as the Issuer and the Registrar may require to complete and deliver Individual Note Certificates (including the name and address of each person in which the Individual Note Certificate are to be registered and the principal amount of each such person's holding) and (ii) (in the case of the Restricted Global Note Certificates only) a certificate given by or on behalf of the holder of each beneficial interest in the Restricted Global Note Certificates stating either (1) that such holder is not transferring its interest at the time of such exchange or (2) that the transfer or exchange of such interest has been made in compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes and that the person transferring such interest reasonably believes that the person acquiring such interest is a qualified institutional buyer and is obtaining such beneficial interest in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A. Individual Note Certificates issued in exchange for interests in the Restricted Global Note Certificates will bear the legends and be subject to the transfer restrictions set out above under ''--Transfer Restrictions''. Such transfer restrictions will terminate two years after the Closing Date, provided that any Notes purchased by or on behalf of the Issuer or any of its affiliates and surrendered for cancellation have been cancelled in accordance with Condition 7(i) (Redemption and Purchase--Cancellation).
Whenever a Global Note Certificate is to be exchanged for Individual Note Certificates, such Individual Note Certificates will be issued within five business days of the delivery to the Registrar of the information and any required certification described in the preceding paragraph against the surrender of the relevant Global Note Certificate at the Specified Office of the Registrar. Such exchange shall be effected in accordance with the regulations concerning the transfer and registration from time to time in relation to the Notes and shall be effected without charge, but against such indemnity as the Registrar may require in respect of any tax or other duty of whatsoever nature which may be levied or imposed in connection with such exchange.
The Registrar will not register the transfer of or exchange of interests in a Global Note Certificate for Individual Note Certificates for a period of 15 days ending on the due date for any payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes.
DTC Book-entry Ownership of Global Note Certificates
The Issuer has applied to DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg for acceptance in their respective book-entry settlement systems of the Unrestricted Notes. Each tranche of the Unrestricted Notes will have a CUSIP number, a common code and an ISIN number. The Issuer has also applied to DTC for acceptance in its book entry settlement system of the Restricted Notes. Each tranche of the Restricted Notes will have a CUSIP number and an ISIN number.
88

The DTC Custodian and DTC will record electronically the principal amount of the Notes represented by the Unrestricted Global Note Certificates and the Restricted Global Note Certificates held within the DTC system. Up to and including the fortieth day after the later of the commencement of the offering and the Closing Date, investors may hold their interests in the Unrestricted Global Note Certificates only through Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear. Thereafter, investors may additionally hold such interests directly through DTC, if they are participants in DTC, or indirectly through organizations which are participants in DTC. Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear will hold interests in the Unrestricted Global Note Certificates on behalf of their account holders through customers' securities accounts in Clearstream, Luxembourg's or Euroclear's respective names on the books of their respective depositaries, which in turn will hold such interests in the Unrestricted Global Note Certificates in customers' securities accounts in the depositaries' names on the books of DTC. Investors may hold their interests in the Restricted Global Note Certificates directly through DTC, if they are participants in DTC, or indirectly through organizations which are participants in DTC.
Payments of the principal of, interest on and any other amounts payable under each Global Note Certificate registered in the name of DTC's nominee will be made to or to the order of its nominee as the registered Holder of such Global Note Certificate. The Issuer expects that the nominee, upon receipt of any such payment, will immediately credit DTC participants' accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective interests in the principal amount of the relevant Global Note Certificate as shown on the records of DTC or the nominee. The Issuer also expects that payments by DTC participants to owners of interests in such Global Note Certificate held through such DTC participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such DTC participants. None of the Issuer, the Registrar, the Fiscal Agent, any Transfer Agent or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of ownership interests in the Global Note Certificates or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such ownership interests.
While a Global Note Certificate is lodged with DTC or its custodian, Notes represented by Individual Note Certificates will not be eligible for clearing or settlement through DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear.
Transfer of Interests in Global Note Certificates
Transfer of interests in Global Note Certificates within DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will be in accordance with the usual rules and operating procedures of the relevant clearing system.
The laws of some states of the United States require that certain persons receive individual certificates in respect of their holdings of Notes. Consequently, the ability to transfer interests in a Global Note Certificate to such persons will be limited. Because DTC only acts on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a person having an interest in a Global Note Certificate to pledge such interest to persons or entities which do not participate in the relevant clearing system or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of an Individual Note Certificate representing such interest.
89

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described above and under ''Plan of Distribution", cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear account holders, on the other, will be effected in DTC in accordance with DTC rules and procedures and on behalf of Clearstream, Luxembourg or (as the case may be) Euroclear by its respective depositary. However, such cross market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Clearstream, Luxembourg or (as the case may be) Euroclear by the counter party in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines. Clearstream, Luxembourg or (as the case may be) Euroclear will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving beneficial interests in the relevant Global Note Certificate in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream, Luxembourg account holders and Euroclear account holders may not deliver instructions directly to the depositaries for Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear.
Because of time zone differences, credits of Notes received in Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during the securities settlement processing day dated the business day following the DTC settlement date and such credits of any transactions in such securities settled during such processing will be reported to the relevant Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear account holder on such business day. Cash received in Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear as a result of sales of Notes by or through a Clearstream, Luxembourg account holder or a Euroclear account holder to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear cash account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC. Settlement between Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg account holders and DTC participants cannot be made on a delivery versus payment basis. The arrangements for transfer of payments must be established separately from the arrangement for transfer of Notes, the latter being effected on a free delivery basis. The customary arrangements for delivery versus payment between Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg account holders or between DTC participants are not effected.
For a further description of restrictions on the transfer of Notes, see ''Plan of Distribution".
DTC has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes (including, without limitation, the presentation of Global Note Certificates for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more participants in whose account with DTC interests in Global Note Certificates are credited, and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Global Note Certificates as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, in certain circumstances, DTC will exchange the Global Note Certificates for Individual Note Certificates (which will, in the case for Restricted Notes, bear the legend set out above under ''--Transfer Restrictions").
Although DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Note Certificates among participants and account holders of DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither the Issuer, the Registrar, the Fiscal Agent nor any Transfer Agent or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear or their respective direct or indirect participants or
90

account holders of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their respective operations.
Modification of Terms and Conditions
The Global Note Certificates will contain provisions which modify the Terms and Conditions of the Notes as they apply to the Notes evidenced by the Global Note Certificates. The following is a summary of certain of those provisions:
Notices: Notwithstanding Condition 16 (Notices), so long as a Global Note Certificate is held on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other clearing system (an ''Alternative Clearing System''), notices to Holders of Notes represented by such Global Note Certificate may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or (as the case may be) such Alternative Clearing System; provided, however, that, so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and its rules so require, notices will also be published in a leading newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Meetings: The holder of a Global Note (unless such Global Note represents only one note) will be treated as being two persons for the purposes of any quorum requirements of a meeting of note holders and, at any such meeting, as having one vote in respect of each U.S.$1,000 principal amount of notes for which such Global Note may be exchanged.
91

Taxation
The discussion below is a general summary o f certain Norwegian and United States tax considerations which are relevant in connection with the acquisition, ownership and disposition o f the notes. This summary is a general summary and does not provide a complete description o f all relevant Norwegian and United States tax regulations. This summary is based on current law and practice. You are advised to consult your own professional tax advisors with respect to your individual tax consequences o f the purchase, ownership or disposition o f the notes.
Norwegian Taxation
Repayment of principal or payment of interest on the notes to persons who have no connection with Norway other than the holding of such notes are not, under present Norwegian law, subject to Norwegian taxation.
For tax-payers resident in Norway, any capital gain on the sale of the notes is taxable as ordinary income at a rate of 28%. Losses are deductible from ordinary income. Under present Norwegian law, any gain is taxable and loss is deductible. Interest income on the notes is taxable as ordinary income. The applicable tax rate is 28%.
No Norwegian issue, tax or stamp duty is payable in connection with the issue or the transfer of the notes.
The notes will not be subject to any Norwegian property tax or estate duties provided that the holder has no connection with Norway other than the holding of the notes and provided that the notes have not been used in or attached to any business activities operated through a permanent establishment situated in Norway.
For individuals resident in Norway, the value of the notes is included when computing the Norwegian wealth tax. Norwegian limited liability companies and certain other companies in a similar position are not subject to wealth tax. Currently, the marginal wealth tax rate is 1.1% of the value assessed.
European Union
On June 3, 2003, the EU Council of Economic and Finance Ministers adopted a new directive regarding the taxation of savings income (Directive 2003/48/EC). The directive is scheduled to be applied by Member States from January 1, 2005, provided that certain non-EU countries adopt similar measures from the same date. Under the directive, each Member State will be required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a person within its jurisdiction to an individual resident in that other Member State; however, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg may instead apply a withholding system for a transitional period in relation to such payments, deducting tax at rates rising over time to 35%. The transitional period is to commence on the date from which the directive is to be applied by Member States and to terminate at the end of the first fiscal year following agreement by certain non-EU countries to the exchange of information relating to such payments.
United States Federal Income Taxation
The following is a summary of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and retirement of notes. This summary only applies to notes held as
92

capital assets and does not address aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be applicable to holders that are subject to special tax rules, such as financial institutions, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, grantor trusts, tax-exempt organizations or dealers or traders in securities or currencies, or to holders that will hold a note as part of a position in a ''straddle'' or as part of a ''hedging'', ''conversion'' or ''integrated'' transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes or that have a ''functional currency'' other than the U.S. dollar. Moreover, this summary does not address the U.S. federal estate and gift or alternative minimum tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership or retirement of notes and does not address the U.S. federal income tax treatment of holders that do not acquire notes as part of the initial distribution at their initial issue price. Each prospective purchaser should consult its tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of notes.
This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, existing and proposed Treasury Regulations, administrative pronouncements and judicial decisions, each as available and in effect on the date hereof. All of the foregoing are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect) or differing interpretations which could affect the tax consequences described herein.
For purposes of this summary, a ''U.S. Holder'' is a beneficial owner of notes who for U.S. federal income tax purposes is (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or partnership organized in or under the laws of the United States or any State thereof (including the District of Columbia); (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust (1) that validly elects to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (2)(a) the administration over which a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision and (b) all of the substantial decisions of which one or more United States persons have the authority to control. A ''Non-U.S. Holder'' is a beneficial owner of notes other than a U.S. Holder.
If a partnership (or any other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds notes, the tax treatment of the partnership and a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such partner or partnership should consult its own tax advisor as to its consequences.
Interest
Interest paid on a note will be includible in a U.S. Holder's gross income as ordinary interest income in accordance with the U.S. Holder's usual method of tax accounting. Interest on the notes will be treated as foreign source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the event Additional Amounts are paid to a U.S. Holder due to the imposition of Norwegian withholding taxes, a U.S. Holder will be treated as having actually received the amount of Norwegian withholding taxes withheld with respect to the notes and as then having paid over such withheld taxes to the Norwegian taxing authorities. In such case, the amount of interest income included by a U.S. Holder in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes with respect to an interest payment may exceed the amount of cash actually received by the U.S. Holder with respect to such payment. Subject to certain limitations, a U.S. Holder generally will be entitled to a credit against its U.S. federal income tax liability, or a deduction in computing its U.S. federal income, for the Norwegian withholding taxes withheld or paid with respect to the note. For U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes, interest on the notes generally will constitute ''passive income'', or, in the case of certain U.S. Holders, ''financial services income.''
93

Subject to the discussion below under the caption ''U.S. Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting'', payments of interest on a note to a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless such income is effectively connected with the conduct by such Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States.
Sale, Exchange or Retirement
Upon the sale, exchange or retirement of a note, a U.S. Holder will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on the sale, exchange or retirement (other than accrued but unpaid interest which may be taxable as such) and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in such note. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in a note generally will equal the cost of such note to the Holder. Any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. In the case of a non-corporate U.S. Holder, the maximum marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to such gain will be lower than the maximum marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income (other than certain dividends) if such U.S. Holder's holding period for such notes exceeds one year. Any gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange or retirement of a note generally will be treated as U.S. source gain or loss, as the case may be.
Subject to the discussion below under the caption ''U.S. Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting'', any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder upon the sale, exchange or retirement of a note generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, unless (i) such gain is effectively connected with the conduct by such Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States or (ii) in the case of any gain realized by an individual Non-U.S. Holder, such holder is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of such sale, exchange or retirement and certain other conditions are met.
U.S. Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting
Backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements apply to certain payments of principal of, and interest on, an obligation and to proceeds of the sale or redemption of an obligation, to certain noncorporate holders of notes that are United States persons. The payor will be required to withhold backup withholding tax within the United States on a note to a holder of a note that is a United States person (other than an ''exempt recipient'', such as a corporation) if such holder fails to furnish its correct taxpayer identification number or otherwise fails to comply with, or establish an exemption from, such backup withholding requirements. Payments within the United States of principal and interest to a holder of a note that is not a United States person will not be subject to backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements if an appropriate certification is provided by the holder (with appropriate attachments from the beneficial owners in the case of certain pass-through entities) to the payor and the payor does not have actual knowledge or a reason to know that the certificate is false. The backup withholding tax rate is 28% for years 2003 through 2010. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability.
THE ABOVE SUMMARY IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF ALL TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE OWNERSHIP OF NOTES. PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF NOTES SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS.
94

Employee Benefit Plan Considerations
The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (''ERISA''), imposes certain requirements on ''employee benefit plans'' (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to ERISA, including entities such as collective investment funds and separate accounts whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans (collectively, ''ERISA Plans'') and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA's general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan's investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan.
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ''Code'') prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans, ''Plans'')) and certain persons (referred to as ''parties in interest'' or ''disqualified persons'') having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A violation of these ''prohibited transaction'' rules may result in an excise tax, penalty or other liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for such persons.
Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if any notes are acquired by a Plan with respect to which any of the company, the transfer agents or the Luxembourg listing agent or any of their respective affiliates are a party in interest or a disqualified person. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire notes and the circumstances under which such decision is made. There can be no assurance that any exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes, or that, if an exemption is available, it will cover all aspects of any particular transaction. By its purchase of any notes, whether in the case of the initial purchase or in the case of a subsequent transfer, the purchaser or holder thereof will be deemed to have represented and agreed either that (i) it is not and for so long as it holds notes will not be an ERISA Plan or other Plan, an entity whose underlying assets include the assets of any such ERISA Plan or other Plan, or a governmental or other employee benefit plan which is subject to any U.S. federal, state or local law, or foreign law, that is substantially similar to the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or (ii) its purchase, holding and disposition of the notes will not result in a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (or, in the case of such a governmental or other employee benefit plan, any such substantially similar U.S. federal, state or local law, or foreign law) for which an exemption is not available.
Governmental plans and certain church and other plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to state or other federal or foreign laws that are substantially similar to ERISA and the Code. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing any Notes.
Any insurance company proposing to invest assets of its general account in the Notes should consider the implications of the United States Supreme Court's decision in John Hancock
95

Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, 510 U.S. 86 (1993), which, in certain circumstances, treats the assets of an insurance company's general account as assets of Plans that own policies or other contracts with the insurance company, as well as the effect of Section 401(c) of ERISA as interpreted by regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Labor (the ''DOL'') in January 2000 and the extent to which exemptive relief under prohibited transaction class exemption 95-60 issued by the DOL will apply to such investment. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and not intended to be all-inclusive. Any Plan fiduciary who proposes to cause a Plan to purchase any Notes should consult with its counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such investment will not constitute or result in a prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA. The sale of notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the company, any transfer agents or the Luxembourg listing agent that such an investment meets all relevant requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan.
96

Plan of Distribution
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. are acting as joint bookrunning managers of the offering and as representatives of the initial purchasers named below. Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the purchase agreement dated the date of this offering memorandum, each initial purchaser named below has agreed to purchase, severally and not jointly, and we have agreed to sell to that initial purchaser, the principal amount of the notes set forth opposite the initial purchaser's name.

Initial Purchaser
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. .. BNP Paribas Securities Corp. Citigroup Global Markets Inc HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. . . .
Total ........................................

Principal Amount

2015 Notes $ 88,000,000 $ 88,000,000 $ 8,000,000 $ 8,000,000 $ 8,000,000
$200,000,000

2033 Notes $ 88,000,000 $ 88,000,000 $ 8,000,000 $ 8,000,000 $ 8,000,000
$200,000,000

The purchase price for the 2015 notes will be the initial offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum less an underwriting discount of 0.55% of the principal amount of the 2015 notes purchased. The purchase price for the 2033 notes will be the initial offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum less an underwriting discount of 0.825% of the principal amount of the 2033 notes purchased.
The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to purchase the notes are subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The initial purchasers must purchase all the notes if they purchase any of the notes.
We have been advised that the initial purchasers propose to resell the 2015 notes and the 2033 notes at the respective offering prices set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum within the United States to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. See ''Form of Notes and Transfer Restrictions''. The price at which the notes are offered may be changed at any time without notice.
Each tranche of notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. Application has been made to list the notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. We cannot assure you that the prices at which either tranche of notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for either tranche of notes will develop and continue after this offering. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and any market-making activities with respect to either tranche of notes may be discontinued at any time without notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of or the trading market for either tranche of notes.
In connection with this offering, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., on behalf of the initial purchasers, may purchase and sell notes in the open market. These transactions may include over-allotment, covering transactions and stabilizing transactions.

97

Over-allotment involves sales of notes in excess of the principal amount of notes to be purchased by the initial purchasers in this offering, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases of notes made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes while the offering is in progress. Any of these activities may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. They may also cause the price of either tranche of the notes to be higher than the price that otherwise would exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.
The initial purchasers have performed certain investment banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they received customary fees and expenses. The initial purchasers may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their businesses.
We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of any of those liabilities.
We have been advised that the initial purchasers may make the notes available for distribution on the Internet through a third-party system operated by Market Axess Inc., an Internet-based communications technology provider. We have also been advised by the initial purchasers that Market Axess Inc. is providing the system as a conduit for communications between the initial purchasers and their respective customers and is not a party to any transactions. We have also been advised by the initial purchasers that Market Axess Inc. is a registered broker-dealer and will receive compensation from the initial purchasers based on transactions conducted through the system. We have been advised by the initial purchasers that they will make the notes available to their respective customers through the Internet on the same terms as distributions of the notes made through other channels. Information on any Web site not included in this offering memorandum is not a part of this offering memorandum.
Selling Restrictions
United States
The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See ''Form of Notes and Transfer Restrictions''.
Accordingly, in connection with sales outside the United States each initial purchaser has agreed that, except as permitted by the purchase agreement and as set forth in ''Form of Notes and Transfer Restrictions'', it will not offer or sell the notes within the United States or to or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons (i) as a part of its distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the closing date, and it will have sent to each dealer to which it sells notes during the 40-day restricted period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the United States or to or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons.

Summary of Certain Significant Differences Between U.S. GAAP and Norwegian GAAP
Our annual and interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in Norway (''Norwegian GAAP''). Norwegian GAAP differs in certain aspects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (''U.S. GAAP'').
The following paragraphs summarize certain differences between Norwegian GAAP and U.S. GAAP that could be significant to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations as of June 30, 2003, and the years ending December 31, 2002 and 2001. We cannot offer any assurances that the differences described below would give rise to the most material differences between our financial statements were they to have been prepared under U.S. GAAP. In addition, we cannot estimate the net effect that applying U.S. GAAP would have on our financial position or results of operations, or any component thereof, in any of the presentations of financial information that have been included in this offering memorandum. However, the effect of such differences may be, individually or in the aggregate, material and, in particular, it may be that the amounts of net income and shareholders' equity prepared on the basis of U.S. GAAP would be materially different than the amounts of net income and shareholders' equity prepared on the basis of Norwegian GAAP. The following summary may not include all differences that exist between Norwegian GAAP and U.S. GAAP. No attempt has been made to identify all disclosure, presentation or classification differences that would affect the manner in which transactions and events are presented in this offering memorandum.
The organizations that promulgate U.S. GAAP have ongoing projects that could have a significant impact on future comparisons between U.S. GAAP and Norwegian GAAP. For example, U.S. Statements on Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 150 ''Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity'', SFAS No. 149 ''Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and Financial Interpretation No. 46 ''Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities'' issued in 2003 with effective dates after June 30, 2003 could result in further significant differences between U.S. GAAP and Norwegian GAAP. Furthermore, certain U.S. standards, in particular SFAS No. 141 ''Business Combinations", SFAS No. 142 ''Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets'', SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations'', SFAS No. 144 ''Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets'' and Financial Interpretation No. 45 ''Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others'' were issued in 2001 or 2002 and are therefore not effective for the entire period for which comparatives are presented.
Business Combinations
According to U.S. GAAP, business combinations are required to be accounted for by the purchase method. The pooling-of-interests method is not allowed under U.S. GAAP. According to Norwegian GAAP, business combinations in which no acquiring party can be identified should be accounted for by the pooling-of-interests method.
Earlier Norwegian legislation, in force up to 1998, allowed for all mergers, regardless of substance, to be accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method in Norway. Our financial statements have not been restated for the effect, if any, of accounting for acquisitions as pooling-of-interest combinations.
103

According to Norwegian GAAP, assets and liabilities other than goodwill are measured at their fair values as of the date of acquisition and the minority interest is stated at the minority's proportion of the fair values. According to U.S. GAAP, the acquirer's interest in the assets and liabilities is measured at fair value and the minority's proportion is measured at pre-acquisition carrying amounts.
The rules regulating recognition of restructuring provisions at the date of acquisition are more flexible under Norwegian GAAP than U.S. GAAP and under certain circumstances provisions recognized according to Norwegian GAAP are not allowed under U.S. GAAP.
Negative Goodwill
Negative goodwill is the excess that arises when the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the cost of the acquired entity. Under U.S. GAAP, negative goodwill should be allocated to reduce proportionately the values assigned to the acquired assets, including research and development assets acquired and charged to expense, except (a) financial assets other than equity accounted investments, (b) assets to be disposed of by sale, (c) deferred tax assets, (d) prepaid assets relating to pension or other post-retirement benefit plans, and (e) any other current assets. Any remainder should be recognized as an extraordinary gain.
Under Norwegian GAAP, negative goodwill should be classified as goodwill (reduction of asset) and amortized systematically over the average life of tangible fixed assets, unless it can be assigned to expected future losses or restructuring expenses that do not qualify for recognition at acquisition. Such negative goodwill should be amortized when these losses or expenses are incurred.
Goodwill and Identifiable Intangibles
According to U.S. GAAP, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested at least annually for impairment. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives, but without the constraint of an arbitrary ceiling. Under Norwegian GAAP, goodwill and intangible assets are amortized, with no limitation as to the amortization period. However, amortization of goodwill or intangible assets of more than 20 years is unusual.
Joint Ventures
Under U.S. GAAP, joint ventures should be accounted for by the equity method. Under Norwegian GAAP, joint ventures should be accounted for by the equity method or the proportional method. Under the proportional method, assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses are consolidated line-by-line on a proportional basis. We use the proportional method for our joint ventures.
Derivative Instruments and Foreign Currency Hedging
In 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 133, ''Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities'', which was subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS No. 138, SFAS No. 149 and SFAS No 150. SFAS No. 133 is mandatory for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.
104

SFAS No. 133 must be applied to derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contacts. It requires that such instruments be recognized in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and measured at fair value. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless special hedge accounting criteria are met.
SFAS No. 133 allows special hedge accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges. SFAS No. 133 requires that the gain or loss on the fair market value of a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedging instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the fair market value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk be recognized currently in earnings in the same accounting period. SFAS No. 133 requires that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss (i.e. the ineffective portion), if any, must be recognized currently in earnings. Any portion of a change in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge which the issuer has elected to exclude from its measurement of effectiveness, such as the change in time value of option contracts, must be recorded immediately in earnings.
Under Norwegian GAAP, no specific accounting standards regarding the accounting recognition for financial instruments exists and, unless used in hedging, cost accounting should be applied.
Foreign Currency Translation
Under U.S. GAAP, the profit and loss account of a foreign subsidiary whose functional currency is different from that of the parent is translated at an appropriate weighted average exchange rate. Under Norwegian GAAP, the profit and loss accounts of foreign subsidiaries that are regarded as an integral part of the parent company's activities are translated at the average exchange rate for the year, except for the cost of materials and depreciation, which are translated at the rate on the transaction date.
Research and Development Costs
U.S. GAAP requires the immediate expense recognition of all research and development costs. Specific exceptions apply related to the development of computer software costs. Norwegian GAAP allows research and development costs that comply with certain criteria to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life; however, immediate expense recognition is common.
Revaluation of Fixed Assets
Under both Norwegian GAAP and U.S. GAAP, a revaluation of fixed assets is not permitted. Until 1998, revaluation was permitted under Norwegian GAAP. Our financial statements have not been restated for the effect, if any, of revaluations of previous years.
Capitalizing of Borrowing Costs
Under Norwegian GAAP and U.S. GAAP, borrowing costs related to the construction of certain assets should be capitalized. However, the borrowing costs include exchange rate differences from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs according to Norwegian GAAP, but not under U.S. GAAP.
105

Leasing
Both U.S. GAAP and Norwegian GAAP differentiate between operating and capital leases. Under U.S. GAAP, leases are capitalized if they meet any one of the four very specific criteria of SFAS No. 13 ''Accounting for Leases''. The same general criteria are applied under Norwegian GAAP, but the substance of the lease agreement will determine the accounting practice applied. Further differences between U.S. GAAP and Norwegian GAAP may occur regarding sale and leaseback transactions.
Inventories
Under U.S. GAAP, the acceptable methods of costing inventory are FIFO, LIFO, weighted moving average and specific identification. Inventory valuation must be recognized at the lower-of-cost-or-market value where market is generally defined as net realizable value. Under Norwegian GAAP, inventory values are measured at the lower of historic cost or fair market value based on the FIFO method. LIFO is not allowed under Norwegian GAAP.
Pensions
Under U.S. GAAP, the determination of pension costs for defined benefit pension plans is made pursuant to SFAS No. 87 ''Employers Accounting for Pensions''. Under Norwegian GAAP, the accounting standard for retirement benefit costs has to be applied. Both U.S. GAAP and Norwegian GAAP require the recognition of the net pension benefit obligation, although U.S. GAAP and Norwegian GAAP differ significantly in relation to matters such as actuarial assumptions and the treatment of actuarial gains.
Dividends
Under U.S. GAAP, dividends are not recognized as liabilities until declared. Under Norwegian GAAP, proposed dividends are usually recognized as liabilities. Under the Norwegian Companies Act, dividends are payable out of annual and retained earnings. The amount of dividends is subject to approval by the shareholders at a general meeting, following the fiscal year to which the dividends relate.
Revenues
Under Norwegian GAAP, revenue is recognized when earned. Under U.S. GAAP, revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
Classification of Minority Interest
Under U.S. GAAP, minority interest should be presented as a separate item between liabilities and shareholders' equity. The minority share of income for the year is subtracted when arriving at net income for the year. Under Norwegian GAAP minority interests are classified as a part of shareholders' equity. Net income for the year includes the minority share of income.
Changes in Accounting Policy
Under U.S. GAAP, the effect of a change in accounting policy is generally reflected as a cumulative adjustment to current year net income and comparatives are not restated. There
106

are certain specific exceptions where restatement is required for certain changes. According to Norwegian GAAP, changes in accounting policies require restatement of prior periods if the effect is material.
Forest Assets
Under U.S. GAAP and Norwegian GAAP, timber and timberlands are stated at cost less accumulated depletion for timber previously harvested. Costs attributable to timber harvested, or depletion, are charged against income as trees are cut. Under Norwegian GAAP, reforestation costs are expensed as incurred.
Asset Retirement Obligations
Under U.S. GAAP an entity should recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. The entity should capitalize an asset retirement cost as an addition to the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and allocate the cost to expense using a systematic and rational method over its useful life. An asset retirement obligation is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, or development and (or) the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is the amount at which that liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing parties. Subsequent changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of the fair value of the liability should be recognized.
Under Norwegian GAAP asset retirement or decommissioning costs are those costs that arise from plant and equipment that have to be dismantled at the end of their life. Norwegian GAAP allows for three possible accounting treatments, with the third listed as the preferred alternative: (1) Gradually build the provision over the estimated economic life of the installation; (2) The present value of the decommissioning costs is taken into the depreciation plan so that the carrying value at the end of the economic life is negative; or (3) The present value of the decommissioning costs is added to the corresponding asset's cost and a corresponding contingency is made.
Income Taxes
Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are classified as current and non-current, on the basis of the assets and liabilities to which they relate. Under Norwegian GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are always shown as on a net basis as either a non current deferred tax asset or a non-current deferred tax liability.
Under Norwegian GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from business combinations can be recorded at their present value. Under U.S. GAAP, discounting of deferred tax assets and liabilities is not permitted.
Financial Investments
According to Norwegian GAAP, fair value accounting for financial investments is limited to current financial assets that are part of a trading portfolio. In practice, only a few companies are considered to have trading portfolios and financial investments are to a great extent accounted for at the lower-of-cost-or-market. Under U.S. GAAP, readily marketable securities are classified into one of the following three categories: ''trading securities" which are valued at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the current period income
107

statement; ''available-for-sale securities" which are valued at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses being taken to equity (i.e. not currently recognized in the income statement); and ''held-to-maturity securities'' which are valued at cost.
Classification of Long-term Debt
Under U.S. GAAP, amounts that are due or payable within one year of the reporting date are reclassified as a current liability. The same treatment is allowed under Norwegian GAAP, but reclassification is not mandatory.
Classification of the Income Statement
Under Norwegian GAAP, the income statement must be presented according to a classification of expenses by nature. Under U.S. GAAP, classification of expenses by function is required.

The financial statements comprise the balance sheet, the statements of income and cash flows, the accompanying notes and the consolidated accounts. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's Board of Directors and Managing Director. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and on other information according to the requirements of the Norwegian Act on Auditing and Auditors. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Norwegian Act on Auditing and Auditors and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway. Those standards and practices require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. To the extent required by law and auditing standards, an audit also comprises a review of the management of the Company's financial affairs and its accounting and internal control systems. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion
· the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with law and regulations and present the financial position of the Company and of the Group as of 31 December 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with accounting standards, principles and practices generally accepted in Norway · the Company's management has fulfilled its duty to properly register and document the accounting information as required by law and accounting standards, principles and practices generally accepted in Norway · the information in the Directors' report concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption, and the proposal for the appropriation of the profit is consistent with the financial statements and comply with law and regulations.

Notes to the Norske Skogindustrier ASA Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Accounting principles
Consolidated accounts
The consolidated accounts are presented in accordance with Norwegian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and are presented in NOK million if not stated otherwise.
The consolidated accounts include the activities of the parent company, Norske Skogindustrier ASA, and its subsidiaries as one financial unit based on the accounting principles as described below. All intercompany transactions are eliminated from the consolidated accounts. Gains and losses arising from transactions between group companies are also eliminated.
Companies in which Norske Skog has a controlling interest are fully included in the consolidated accounts. In the case where subsidiaries are not wholly owned, minority interests are deducted and shown as separate items in the profit & loss account and in the balance sheet. The subsidiaries are consolidated into the consolidated accounts from the date Norske Skog obtains control over the subsidiary. Shares in subsidiaries are eliminated according to the purchase method. That is, the cost of the acquisition of the shares is allocated to the subsidiary's assets and liabilities, which are entered in the consolidated accounts at the fair value at the time of purchase. Cost of acquisition in excess of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities is entered as goodwill in the balance sheet.
The equity method is used for affiliated companies. Affiliates are those companies in which Norske Skog has a substantial, but not a controlling interest. The equity method requires that the Group's share of the affiliate's profit or loss after tax is shown on a separate line in the profit & loss account, whilst its share of the affiliate's equity, adjusted for fair value, is classified as fixed asset in the balance sheet.
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using proportionate consolidation. The share of income, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash-flow is recognised line by line in the consolidated accounts. Joint ventures are business activities that Norske Skog runs in co-operation with one or more participants. The business is regulated by an agreement between the participants. Joint venture implies that no participant has a majority interest in the business.
Most of the foreign subsidiaries in the Group's accounts are classified as independent entities. On consolidation of the independent foreign subsidiaries, balance sheet items are translated at the year-end exchange rate. Profit & loss items are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The translation difference is entered as an adjustment to consolidated equity.
Other foreign subsidiaries are classified as an integral part of the parent company's operations. On consolidation of foreign subsidiaries that are regarded as an integral part of the parent company's activities, monetary items are translated at the year-end exchange rate. Non monetary items are translated at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Profit & loss account items are translated at the average exchange rate for the year, except for cost of materials and depreciation, which are translated at the rate on the transaction date. The translation difference is presented as a financial item in the profit & loss account.
Operating revenues
All sales are recognised as revenues at the time of delivery to the customer. Operating revenue is the gross operating revenue less commissions, rebates and other direct price reductions.
F-6

Notes to the Norske Skogindustrier ASA Consolidated Financial Statements -- (Continued)
Classifications in the balance sheet
Assets and liabilities linked with the flow of goods are classified as current assets and liabilities. Other assets are classified as fixed assets when the company intends to keep them for continued use or ownership. Liabilities that fall due for payment later than one year after the balance sheet date are classified as long term liabilities. Other assets and liabilities are classified as current assets and current liabilities.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies
Unhedged assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into NOK at the year-end exchange rate. Balance sheet items in foreign currencies that are hedged by financial instruments are entered at the hedging exchange rate. Balance sheet items in foreign currencies that hedge against each other are entered at the year-end exchange rate. Gain and loss due to changes in currency rates on debt in foreign currency that is regarded as a hedge of the value of an independent subsidiary in foreign currency is booked against equity, together with the translation difference arising from the translation of the subsidiary. Gain and loss due to changes in currency rates on balance sheet items related to operations is included in the operating profit. Gain and loss due to changes in currency rates on other balance sheet items is classified as financial item.
Financial instruments
Treatment of financial instruments for accounting purposes follows the intentions underlying the associated contract. At the time a contract is entered, it is defined either as a hedging or as a trading contract. The various types of financial instruments used for hedging interest risks are assessed as separate portfolios. The portfolios are then assessed at cost price or market value, whichever is the lower. In cases where the contracts entered are classified as hedging transactions, revenues and costs are accrued and classified in the same way as the underlying balance sheet items. Financial instruments in foreign currencies that are not classified as hedging for accounting purposes are assessed at market value.
Shares, bonds, certificates, bills etc.
Shares, bonds and certificates classified as current assets and which are regarded as part of a trading portfolio are valued at market value.
Shares classified as fixed assets that are not attributed to affiliated companies are strategic investments where the Group cannot be said to have any significant influence. These share holdings are valued at cost price, or possibly the fair value when a drop in value is of a permanent nature.
Inventory
Raw materials and other purchased goods are valued at purchase cost according to the FIFO principle. Finished goods are valued at production cost, which includes raw materials, energy, direct wages and a share of indirect costs, including ordinary maintenance and depreciation. The net selling value at a future selling date will be used if that is lower.
F-7

Notes to the Norske Skogindustrier ASA Consolidated Financial Statements -- (Continued)
Fixed assets and depreciation
Fixed assets are valued at historical cost. Acquisition cost for tangible assets having long term future economic benefits are capitalised and classified as assets in the balance sheet. Spare parts are capitalised with the asset to which they pertain. For major investments with a long production time, interest is capitalised as part of the acquisition cost. Expenditure to increase capacity or improve quality that represents a future increase in earnings is capitalised in the balance sheet. Maintenance costs are expensed as an operating cost.
Ordinary depreciation is calculated from the time the use of the tangible asset commences and is calculated on the basis of the economic life of the asset.
Norske Skog has implemented the preliminary Norwegian accounting standard on impairment of assets in 2002.
Research & development
Research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred and are classified as operating costs.
Leasing
Leasing contracts are assessed as financial or operational leasing after an assessment is made of each contract. Leasing contracts that are associated with tangible assets and classified as a financial lease are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciation is charged as for ordinary tangible assets. The tangible assets are capitalised at the present value of the lease payment. If the fair value of the fixed asset are lower than the present value of the lease payments on the contract date, the fair value is capitalised. The amortisation portion of the leasing obligation is entered as long-term debt. The amount of debt is reduced by the rental paid after deduction of the calculated interest cost. Leasing agreements that are classified as an operational lease are not capitalised in the balance sheet. The leasing charge is expensed.
Pension costs and obligations
Pension obligations are calculated as the discounted value of the future pension benefits deemed to have accrued at year-end, based on the employees earning pension rights steadily throughout the working period. Funds belonging to the pension scheme are assessed at their fair value and are entered net against pension obligations in the balance sheet. Each individual pension plan is assessed separately, but the value of over-financing in one plan and under financing in another is entered net in the balance sheet, provided that pension scheme funds are transferable between the plans. Net pension scheme funds are entered as long-term receivables and net pension obligations as long-term debt. Pension obligations and pension scheme funds are calculated on the basis of financial and actuarial assumptions as explained in note 4.
Net pension costs for the period are included in ''wages and personnel expenses'' and consist of the present value of pension earned in the year, interest expenses on the pension obligation, anticipated returns on pension scheme funds, expensed portion of differences in
F-8

Notes to the Norske Skogindustrier ASA Consolidated Financial Statements -- (Continued)
estimates and pension plans, expensed portion of difference between actual and anticipated returns, and accrued national insurance.
Bond loans The value of bond loans in the balance sheet is reduced by holdings of the company's own bonds. Value above/below par is expensed when purchasing own bonds.
Taxes The tax cost consists of payable tax and the change in deferred tax. Payable tax is calculated on the basis of the taxable earnings and the change in deferred tax is calculated on the basis of the year's change in temporary differences. Deferred tax in the balance sheet is calculated based on temporary timing differences between financial accounts and tax accounts and any tax losses that can be carried forward at the end of the financial year. Tax-reducing temporary differences and losses to be carried forward are set off against tax-increasing temporary differences reversed during the same period. Full provision is normally made according to the debt method without discounting to present value. Deferred tax in acquired companies is valued at present value when this provides a true reflection of the underlying transaction.
Cash flow
The cash flow is reported using the direct method. The direct method provides cash flow from operational-, investment- and financing activities on a gross basis. Liquid assets contains bank deposits and short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes to the value.
Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities are provided for if the possibility of their settlement are more than 50%. Best estimate are used when calculating the value of the settlement. See note 27 where other material issues are commented on.
Changes in the Group structure 2002 Norske Skog's forest properties in the southern part of Norway were sold in December. Total value on the balance sheet of the forest properties was NOK 36 million. In May 2002 NorskeCanada made a share issue. Norske Skog did not participate in this share issue. This resulted in a reduction of Norske Skog's share in NorskeCanada. After the share issue, Norske Skog's share was reduced from 36.1% to 30.6%.
2001 Forest properties in Sweden and Brazil were sold in 2001. Total book value of the properties in Sweden was NOK 40 million. The book value of the properties in Brazil was NOK 712 million.

Notes to the Norske Skogindustrier ASA Consolidated Financial Statements -- (Continued)
The joint venture Pan Asia Paper Company was originally owned by Norske Skog, Abitibi Consolidated in Canada, and Hansol in Korea, each holding 1/3 of the share in the company. During spring 2001 Hansol offered the other two participants to take over Hansol's 33% share of Pan Asia Paper Company. The transaction date was 16 August, resulting in a share ownership of 50% for both Norske Skog and Abitibi. The transaction increased the total assets in the balance sheet by NOK 2 600 million.
30 November 2001 Norske Skog acquired the two publication paper mills Walsum in Germany and Parenco in the Netherlands. The German Haindl Group formerly owned the two mills. The acquisition increased Norske Skog's capacity for production of publication paper with 880 000 tonnes. The customer base of the two mills was also taken over by Norske Skog. The mills were consolidated from 1 December. The transaction increased the total assets on the balance sheet by NOK 10 100 million.
The two pulp mills Tasman Pulp in New Zealand and Mackenzie Pulp in Canada were sold 30 April and 15 June respectively. Tasman Pulp had an annual turnover of NOK 1 500 million, and Mackenzie Pulp had an annual turnover of NOK 900 million. The two mills' contribution to total assets on the balance sheet was NOK 1 300 million and NOK 850 million respectively.
In August NorskeCanada acquired Pacifica Papers. The acquisition was partly financed by a share issue in NorskeCanada. The share issue resulted in a reduction of Norske Skog's ownership in NorskeCanada from 50.8% to 36.1%. Therefore from September 2001 NorskeCanada is presented as an affiliated company in the consolidated accounts of Norske Skog. In relation to the deconsolidation of NorskeCanada the minority interests in the consolidated accounts were reduced by NOK 7 057 million.

estimated value is corrected every year in accordance with the figures provided by the life insurance company regarding the market value of the assets.
In measuring incurred obligations the projected obligation at year end is used. This projected obligation is corrected every year in accordance with the figures provided by the actuary concerning incurred pension obligations.

The uninsured benefit obligations include estimated future obligations connected with the AFP arrangements. Uninsured schemes also include obligations concerning former owners of subsidiaries, and pensions of top management and Board members.

In connection with the merger of the share classes there was a split of the shares, and the number of shares doubled. In addition the initial A-share holders were given the opportunity to take part in a share issue of 17 million shares for NOK 10 per share. 23 million new shares

Total liquid assets..................................................................................................................................... 868 4 158
The large cash-reserve in 2001 is partly a result of a divestment of forest in Brazil. This divestment took place late in 2001, and the cash was not utilised before 2002. A considerable part of the cash-reserve at 31 December 2001 was used for downpayment of debt in the first quarter of 2002. In addition the Group has reduced its requirement related to a strategic cash reserve. This reserve is placed in interest bearing securities.
The Group has limited access to liquid assets in joint ventures and in companies with large minority interests. In 2002 this amounts to NOK 141 million. In 2001 this amounts to NOK 151 million and in 2000 NOK 5 624 million where NorskeCanada amount to NOK 5 481 million. Restricted bank deposits in 2002 amounts to NOK 18 million. Corresponding amounts for 2001 were NOK 2 million.

(1) Norske Skogindustrier ASA

As at 31 December 2002 Norske Skog had a total holdings of own shares of 888 247 shares equivalent to 0.67% of the total number of shares. The shares were acquired in the merger with Aktieselskapet Union (Union Co) in 1999, and are primarily used in the share ownership programme for the employees and settlement of bonus agreements.

F-31

Notes to the Norske Skogindustrier ASA Consolidated Financial Statements -- (Continued)
At the Shareholders meeting held on 29 April 2002 the Board of Directors were given the authority to acquire up to 10% of the company's shares on certain conditions. The authority was given for a period of 18 months.
During 2002 the shareholders' equity of Norske Skog has been reduced by NOK 1 951 million due to the strengthening of the NOK compared to the currencies of the other countries where the Group operates. The reduction of the equity is related to the translation of foreign subsidiaries from local currencies to NOK. In particular it is the strengthening of the NOK compared to USD, AUD, NZD and EUR that contributes to the negative effect on the equity.

If the interest rate in the market is reduced, the Group will profit from receiving fixed interest and paying floating interest. Market values are calculated by using market rate curves as of 31 December 2002. The Group uses interest rate swaps for interest rate hedging. Unrealised market to market re-valuation are not booked in the Profit & Loss. This is in line with the underlying debt being kept at cost.

Notes to the Norske Skogindustrier ASA Consolidated Financial Statements -- (Continued)
Norske Skogindustrier ASA and subsidiaries do not pledge any assets as the loan agreements contain a negative pledge clause. This is not prevailing for PanAsia which has pledged some of its assets.
26. Environment
In 2002 the environmental investments were NOK 175 million. For 2001 the amount was NOK 70 million.
The greater part of the investments were made at Walsum, Parenco and Bio Bio. Walsum has carried out an extensive reconstruction of the effluent treatment plant with the objective to reduce the discharge of organic material (COD) by at least 20%. The objective has been reached.
Parenco has completed the construction of a new central dewatering plant for sludge from the de-inking process. Construction work on a new bio fuel boiler was started in the autumn 2002. The start-up of the boiler is planned for spring 2004.
At Bio Bio a new effluent treatment plant is under construction. The startup is planned for May 2003.
27. Other commitments
In 1998 Norske Skog finalised a lease and lease back arrangement with an American investor for PM5 and PM6 at Saugbrugsforeningen. The present value of the cost of the lease back is approximately NOK 4 000 million and is irrecoverably deposited in favour of the American investor. Although the sum has been deposited, Norske Skog is not exonerated from liability for payment. However the credit risk is extremely low as the funds are held in a bank with A rating. Deposited rental costs and prepaid rental earnings are entered net in the balance sheet. Should Norske Skog be unable to perform the leasing agreement it is under obligation to recompense investor for any losses. The investor's loss will vary over the term of the lease and will at most amount to USD 98 million. The possibility of Norske Skog being unable to perform the contract is extremely low. The contract could only be broken off as the result of extraordinary circumstances in the nature of force majeure.
In 1999 Norske Skog, Abitibi-Consolidated and Hansol established PanAsia joint venture. Hansol Paper exited PanAsia in 2001 and sold its one-third stake in equal parts to Norske Skog and Abitibi-Consolidated. The relationship between the remaining parties in the joint venture is regulated in a shareholder's agreement. An important condition for the joint venture is that the future expansion of the parties within PanAsia's market should take place through PanAsia, and that PanAsia should have a growth strategy. Australasia is not included in the market of PanAsia. According to the shareholder's agreement, PanAsia has an option to buy Norske Skog's 33.7% share in Malaysian Newprint Industries at an agreed price.
Norske Skog and Klabin Fabricadora de Papel e Celulose SA each own 50% of the shares in the joint venture Norske Skog Klabin Comercio E Industria. Norske Skog Klabin Comercio E Industria administers the means of production and the input factors for a period that expires in 2003. At the end of the period most of the company's assets will be tied to its market position. Norske Skog is committed to buy out Klabin at the termination of the joint venture agreement
F-37

Notes to the Norske Skogindustrier ASA Consolidated Financial Statements -- (Continued)
in March 2003. This amounts to USD 28 million. The costs will be capitalised as intangible assets. Norske Skog has an additional commitment to pay Klabin USD 18 million if Norske Skog should decide to build a new paper machine to replace the capacity of Klabin. This commitment is limited for three years.
In the annual accounts for 2002, a provision of NOK600 million for costs related to the work force reductions in relation to the initiated improvement programme is made. The provision covers the costs of a work force reduction of approximately 1 200 employees.
28. Currency and interest risk
Currency risk
Norske Skog has currency risk related to both Profit & Loss and the balance sheet.
Transaction risk
The Group has incoming and outgoing transactions in various currencies. The most important of these being EUR, NOK, USD, GBP, AUD and NZD. Transaction risk is the potential difference in the future value of outgoing or incoming funds in the different currencies. The Group calculates a 12-month future expected cash flow in each currency on a rolling basis. 50-100% of the Group's expected cash flows should be hedged at any time using either forwards/futures or currency options. Only 100% owned subsidiaries, where we have direct access to the cash flow, are included in the hedging.
The result of the hedging is included under ''Financial Items'' of Profit & Loss in the group accounts. In 2002, the cash flow hedging generated a profit of NOK 884 million. Currency loss or income will, over time, hedge increased or reduced future net operational income.
Translation risk
The group accounts are calculated in NOK. The translation risk arises when the subsidiaries' balance sheets are translated from their local currency to NOK. Norske Skog has been aiming to hedge the relationship between equity and debt (gearing) in 2002. This risk is secured at group level by group debt being drawn up in currency, as well as using short- and long forwards. This combination gives a currency spread that reflects the combination of net assets on the group balance sheet. Refer to table on page 20 which shows the composition of the debt related to the balance sheet hedge.
The currency result of the hedging is booked directly against the equity and is set off against translation differences from net equity at subsidiary level.
Use of forwards for adjusting currency allocation on debt will offer other liquidity outcomes linked to exchange rate movements, than the use of traditional currency debt.
Interest risk
Norske Skog considers a floating interest rate on its group debt to be risk reducing. This is related to the correlation between Norske Skog's income and economic cycles where the interest rate is normally high during economic boom and low during recessions.
F-38

Notes to the Norske Skogindustrier ASA Consolidated Financial Statements -- (Continued)
The Group has outstanding certificates and fixed interest rate bonds with a nominal value of NOK 8 903 million. The switch to floating interest payments on existing fixed interest loans is achieved by using interest rate swaps. The economic risk on the debt portfolio is measured by interest rate sensitivity (duration). In some cases interest rate derivatives are used in order to adjust the duration of individual currencies. Credit risk Norske Skog conducts credit risk analysis of all investment counterparts. The requirements is that the company must be A-rated. Requirements to key-figures are the same for non-rated companies as for A-rated companies.
29. Events after the balance sheet date
3 January 2003 13 power stations were sold for NOK 1 267 million. The sale of the power stations is expected to yield a gain of approximately NOK 450 million after tax.

Notes to the Norske Skogindustrier ASA Unconsolidated Financial Statements 1. Accounting principles
The company's accounting principles are the same as those for the consolidated accounts, which are described on pages F-6 through F-9. Only those notes which are different, are shown below. Investments in subsidiaries are valued at historical cost, in accordance with the option stated by the Department of Finance. All figures are stated in NOK million unless otherwise stated.
Monetary items that is receivable from, or payable to, a foreign subsidiary for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future is, in substance an extension to, or a deduction from, the net investment in the foreign subsidiary. Foreign currency gains and losses on the receivables and payables which in substance form part of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries are not recognised until the disposal of the investments in the foreign subsidiaries. The principle also applies to exchange differences arising on foreign currency liabilities accounted for as a hedge of the net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
2. Operating revenue
Operating Revenue includes ordinary revenue from sale of goods and services to companies within the Group to the value of NOK 1 366 million, the corresponding figure in 2001 was NOK 1 858 million. All intercompany deliveries, intercompany profits and intercompany debts between departments are eliminated in the accounts.
