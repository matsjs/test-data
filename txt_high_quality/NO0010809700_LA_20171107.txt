As Advanzia is reporting in EUR, the NOK equivalent amount shall equal the average EURNOK exchange rate for the previous twelve months (as per Norges Bank fixings) at the end of the relevant interim period. The net earnings being used shall be adjusted for any one-off accounting effects resulting from changes related to implementation of IFRS9 or similar changes in accounting principles; and

Such valuation shall be made on the basis of a sale for prompt delivery for cash at arm's length on normal commercial terms as between a willing seller and willing buyer, on an "as is where is" basis, free of any existing charters or other contracts for employment. The cost of such determination shall be for the account of the Issuer twice per year. The valuation shall be made at least semi annually, or following an Event of Default (as defined below), upon the request of the Trustee; and

"Total Assets" means the aggregate book value of an entity's (on a unconsolidated or consolidated basis as the case may be) total assets treated as assets in accordance with GAAP, as illustrated in the then most recent Financial Statements or SemiAnnually Financial Report (as the case may be) of such entity.
