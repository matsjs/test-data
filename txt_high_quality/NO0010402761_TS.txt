SUMMARY

The following summary should be read as an introduction to this Prospectus, and is qualified in its entirety, by the more detailed information and the Appendices appearing elsewhere in this Prospectus. Any decision to invest in the Notes should be based on a consideration of the Prospectus as a whole.

In case a claim relating to the information contained in the Prospectus is brought before a court, the plaintiff investor might have to bear the cost of translating the Prospectus before legal proceedings are initiated. Civil liability attaches to those persons who are responsible for the summary, including any translation thereof, and appliedfor its notification, but only if the summary is misleading, inaccurate or inconsistent when read together with the other parts of the Prospectus.

1.1 Description of PGS
PGS is a leading worldwide geophysical company. PGS provides an extensive range of seismic services and products for the petroleum industry including data acquisition, processing, reservoir analysis and interpretation. The Company also possesses an extensive multi-client data library.
The Company was formed in 1962, but started trading under its current name in 1991 after a merger between Geoteam AS and Nopec AS. Its shares have been listed on Oslo Børs since August 1992. Today, PGS is headquartered at Lysaker, Norway and the Company with subsidiaries (referred to herein as the "Group") has offices in 26 different countries with large regional offices in London, Houston and Singapore.
After the recent acquisition (the "Acquisition") of all of the shares in Arrow Seismic ASA, a Norwegian incorporated company listed on Oslo Børs ("Arrow"), the sale of Ramform Victory and the delivery of the newbuild Ramform Sovereign, the Group currently owns 15 marine streamer vessels, including 6 vessels of the unique Ramform class, which are all in operations. In addition, PGS has ordered one new-build vessel scheduled for delivery in Q2 2009, respectively, and Arrow has ordered four high capacity seismic new build vessels for delivery in 2008 and 2009 (of which two are leased to another seismic company). Arrow has also purchased two vessels planned for conversion.
The Group operates between 8 and 12 onshore crews and has 20 data processing centers.
The business is divided into two segments, marine and onshore. In addition, data processing and technology is reported as part of the marine segment. The marine segment (including data processing and technology), which accounts for approximately 80 per cent. of the Group's total turnover, is managed from Lysaker, Norway. The onshore segment accounts for approximately 20 per cent. of the Group's total turnover and is managed from Houston, Texas, USA.

5

The marine business acquires, markets and sells seismic data worldwide, which is used by companies to help locate oil and natural gas, and to determine the size and structure of known oil and natural gas reservoirs. The Company acquires seismic data both on an exclusive contract basis for its customers as well as on its own behalf as multi-client data for licensing to multiple customers on a non-exclusive basis. Multi-client revenues come from customer pre-funding of an acquisition as well as from the sale of data that has already been acquired and is part of the library (the latter being referred to as late sales).
Data processing and technology, which is a part of the marine segment, consists of data processing, interpretation, technology development, research and development and reservoirrelated consulting activities.
The onshore business consists of PGS' seismic acquisition operations on land, in shallow water and in transition zones. Operations also include seismic data acquisition for the onshore multi-client library.
Please refer to Section 8 for a more comprehensive summary of the Group's business.
1.2 Purpose and background of the Listing
The Notes are currently not listed on Oslo Børs or any other regulated market place. The Ordinary Shares are listed on Oslo Børs. The Company has decided to list the Notes on Oslo Børs in order to provide a regulated marketplace for the trading of its Notes and to facilitate potential liquidity in the Notes. The Company has applied for and received approval from Oslo Børs for a listing of the Notes. It is expected that the Notes will be listed on Oslo Børs on or about 19 March 2008, but no assurances can be given that the Listing can be achieved by that date, or at all. Transaction costs and all other directly attributable costs in connection with the Listing will be paid by the Company. The total costs incurred by the Company in connection with the Listing are expected to amount to approximately NOK 300,000.

1.7 The Notes
On 3 December 2007, the Company's Board of Directors approved the issuance of U.S.$ 400,000,000 2.7 per cent. Convertible Notes due 2012, convertible into Ordinary Shares of the Company. The Notes have been issued in accordance with the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act. The Notes have a final maturity date of 3 December 2012.
The net proceeds from the Notes have been used to the refinancing of a bridge facility of U.S.$ 450,000,000 which has been utilised to finance the Acquisition, and will further be used for general corporate purposes.
The Notes will bear an interest at a rate of 2.7 per cent. per annum, payable semi-annually in arrear, and the initial conversion price is NOK 216.19 per Ordinary Share (subject to the adjustments as set out in Condition 6 (b) of the Conditions included in Section 6 of this Prospectus). The Notes are issued in denominations of U.S.$ 100,000. Consequently, the Notes are convertible into a maximum share capital increase of NOK 30,632,782. The latest date for conversion of the Notes is 28 November 2012. PGS will be entitled to redeem the Notes prior to the final maturity under certain circumstances, see Condition 7 of the Conditions.

RISK FACTORS

Investing in the Notes involves inherent risks. Prospective investors should consider, among other things, the risk factors set out in this Prospectus before making an investment decision. The risks described below are not the only ones facing the Company and the Group. Additional risks not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair the Group's business operations and adversely affect the price of the Notes. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Group's, and thereby the Company's, business, financial position and operating results could be materially adversely affected. A prospective investor should consider carefully the factors set forth below, and elsewhere in the Prospectus, and should consult his or her own expert advisors as to the suitability of an investment in the Notes. An investment in the Notes is suitable only for investors who understand the riskfactors associated with this type of investment and who can afford a loss of all or part of the investment.

2.1 Risks attached to the Group and the industry in which it operates
2.1.1 Economic development and trends
The demand for geophysical services is dependent upon overall global economic development and oil and gas price developments. Fluctuations and changes in these conditions may affect the Group's revenues and results. The Group's business and operations will depend substantially on the level of activity and capital spending by oil and gas companies in particular in relation to development and exploration. The activities of the oil and gas companies tend to follow the prices of oil and gas which have fluctuated widely over the recent years. A decrease in the prices of oil and gas may have a negative impact on the expenditure on exploration activities and thus may affect the demand for the services of the Group. Financial projections for and valuation of the Group's assets are largely based on certain assumptions including those related to future market conditions for the markets in which the Group will sell its services. Actual changes in market conditions may affect the accuracy of the assumptions and future prospects of the Group. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and currently oil and gas prices worldwide are significantly above historic levels.

2.1.2 Significant investments are made without certainty of revenue
PGS invests significant amounts in acquiring and processing seismic data that the Group owns ("multi-client data"). Future multi-client data licenses, including the timing of such licenses, are uncertain and depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the Group's control. By making such investments, the Group assumes the risk that:

· it may not fully recover the costs of the data through future licenses; and

· the value of the multi-client data could be adversely affected by, among other things, any adverse change in the general prospects for oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities in the areas where the Group acquires multi-

11

client data, by technological or regulatory changes and by other industry or general economic developments.
2.1.3 Multi-jurisdictional operations
The Group's revenue is derived from operations in a variety of jurisdictions, hereunder countries which are regarded as unsafe or politically unstable. These operations are subject to varying degrees of risks inherent in doing business in such areas, including:
· war, terrorist activities, political, civil or labour disturbances, border disputes and embargoes;
· damage to equipment or violence directed at employees;
· the possibility of unfavourable changes in tax or other laws;
· work stoppages;
· renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;
· restrictions on currency repatriation or the imposition of new laws or regulations that preclude or restrict the conversion and free flow of currencies;
· difficult environment to enforce contractual rights;
· the imposition of new laws or regulations that have the effect of restricting operations or increasing the cost of operations; and
· the disruption or delay of licensing or leasing activities.
2.1.4 Government regulation and political risks
The Group's operations are subject to numerous international conventions as well as national, state and local laws, and regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which the Group conducts, or will conduct, its business. These laws and regulations relate to the protection of the environment, natural resources, human health and safety, taxes, certification, licensing and other requirements. In particular, compliance with environmental regulations may require significant expenditures and breaches may result in fines and penalties, which may be material. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringently enforced and expensive to comply with and this trend is likely to continue. Whilst the Company has also paid particular attention to safety and environment in their planning of the business, stricter regulation or changes in the application of existing regulations may impose increased costs on operating the business of the Group, or otherwise impact the Group's financial condition, operating results or future prospects. The Company cannot predict the extent to which its future cash flow and earnings may be affected by mandatory compliance with any such new legislation or regulations.
12

2.1.5 Revenues mayfluctuate significantly from period to period
The Group's future revenues may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year as a result of various factors including the following:
· increases and decreases in industry-wide capacity to acquire seismic data;
· fluctuating oil and natural gas prices, which may impact customer demand for the Group's services;
· different levels of activity planned by the customers;
· the timing of offshore lease sales and licensing rounds and the effect of such timing on the demand for seismic data and geophysical services;
· the timing of award and commencement of significant contracts for geophysical data acquisition services;
· weather and other seasonal factors;
· seasonality and other variations in the licensing of geophysical data from the Group's multi-client data library; and
· reduced vessel utilisation due to longer than scheduled yardstays, steaming for two Ramform vessels and delays in obtaining necessary permits.
For instance, on 19 December 2007, the Company announced that compared to the guidance given in the Company's interim financial report for the third quarter 2007, the expected fourth quarter 2007 productive time and related revenues and margins in the marine contract segment have been reduced. This was primarily due to longer than scheduled yardstays and steaming for two Ramform vessels and a delay in obtaining operational permits for one Ramform vessel. Please see Section 8.6 - "Recent developments" - for further information on the announcement.
2.1.6 Service life and technical risks
The service life of a modern seismic vessel is generally considered to exceed twenty-five years, but may ultimately depend on its efficiency, vessel maintenance and demand for such equipment. There can be no guarantee that the vessels owned or operated by the Group will have a long service life. The vessels may experience particular unforeseen technical problems or deficiencies, new environmental requirements may be enforced, or new technical solutions or vessels may be introduced that are more efficient than the vessels owned or operated by the Group, causing less demand and use of these vessels.
13

2.1.7 Competition
The markets in which the Group operates are highly competitive. The Group may face competition from certain companies within the seismic industry as well as other ship owners. Furthermore, overcapacity in the seismic market would have a negative effect on the operating results of the Group.
2.1.8 Construction risks
Arrow, a newly acquired subsidiary of PGS, currently has four new building projects and two conversion projects. In addition, the Group has one new building project independent of Arrow. As a result, the Group is exposed to the risk of failure, cost overruns, delayed delivery, and technically unsound solutions associated with the new building and conversion projects. There can be no assurances that delays and cost overruns will not occur and such events, if occurring, could have an adverse impact on the financial position of the Group.
2.1.9 Operating risks
The Group's assets are concentrated in a single industry and the Group may be more vulnerable to particular economic, political, regulatory, environmental or other developments than a company with a more diversified portfolio of activities. It is not possible to give any guarantees that the vessels will be employed for the duration of their service life. There is an inherent exposure to technical risks, which may lead to operational problems, and increased operational costs and/or loss of earnings, additional investments, penalty payments, and other such costs which may have a material effect on the earnings and financial position of the Group.
The seismic data acquisition operations are exposed to extreme weather and other hazardous conditions. In particular, a substantial portion of the Group's operations are subject to perils that are customary for marine operations, including capsizing, grounding, collision, interruption and damage or loss from severe weather conditions, fire, explosions and environmental contamination from spillage. Any of these risks, whether in the marine or onshore operations, could result in damage to or destruction of vessels or equipment, personal injury and property damage, suspension of operations or environmental damage. In addition, the operations involve risks of a technical and operational nature due to the complex systems that are utilised. If any of these risks materialise, the Group's business could be interrupted and the Group could incur significant liabilities. In addition, many similar risks may result in curtailment or cancellation of, or delays in, exploration and production activities of the customers, which could in turn adversely impact the Group's operations.
2.1.10 Insurance protection
The Group does not carry full insurance for all of its operating risks. Although the Group generally attempts to carry insurance against the destruction of or damage to the seismic vessels and equipment in amounts that the Company considers customary in the industry, such insurance coverage is subject to various exclusions. In addition, the Group may not be able to maintain adequate insurance cover for its vessels and equipment in the future or do so
14

at premiums that are considered reasonable. The Group does not maintain insurance to protect against loss of revenues caused by business interruptions. An accident involving any of the Group's assets could result in loss of earnings, fines or penalties, higher insurance costs and damage to the reputation of the Company. The Group may not have sufficient insurance cover for the entire range of risks resulting in that particular losses may not be covered. Any significant loss or liability not insured could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the loss of or continuing unavailability of one or several of the vessels could have an adverse effect on the Group even if effective insurance cover should be available.
2.1.11 Access to personnel
The Group's success depends, to a significant extent, upon management and key employees. Attracting key personnel will assist in the expansion of the Group's business. The maritime and seismic industries face competition for skilled personnel. There is no assurance that the Group will successfully attract the personnel required to continue to expand its business and to successfully execute its business strategy.
2.1.12 PGS has experienced substantial losses in the past and may do so in the future
PGS has experienced substantial losses in the past. For the year ended 31 December 2004, PGS suffered a net loss of U.S.$ 135,000,000. In addition, in July 2003, PGS implemented a financial restructuring plan that was accomplished through reorganisation under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Group's cash flow from the Group's operations may not be sufficient to fund ongoing activities and implement its business plans, and PGS may experience substantial losses also in the future.
2.1.13 Technology may become obsolete
The Group's technology could be rendered obsolete because technological changes and new products and services are regularly introduced to the Group's markets, and the Group may not be able to develop and produce competitive products and services on a cost-effective and timely basis. The Group will be required to invest substantial capital to maintain competitive technologies. Technology changes rapidly, and new and enhanced products and services are frequently introduced in the relevant markets. The Group' success depends to a significant extent on its ability to develop and produce new and enhanced products and services on a cost effective and timely basis in accordance with industry demands. While the Group commits resources to research and development, it may encounter resource constraints or technical or other difficulties that could delay introduction of new and enhanced products and services in the future. In addition, continuing development of new products and services inherently carries the risk of obsolescence of older products and services. New and enhanced products and services, if introduced, may not gain market acceptance or may be adversely affected by technological changes.
15

2.2 Risk associated with the Group's financing and accounts
2.2.1 Borrowing and leverage
The Group is highly leveraged. This high leverage exposes the Group to additional risks and restricts the Group in various ways in terms of how the Group operates its business. The Group's existing credit facility, and other debt and contractual obligations, contain customary prepayment provisions, representations and warranties, covenants and restrictions, events of default and other customary provisions for such financings. Because of the level of debt and related contractual obligations, now or in the future:
· the Group may need to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to debt service, which will reduce the amount of cash flow it will have available for capital investment, working capital and other general corporate purposes;
· the Group will be vulnerable to adverse developments in general economic and industry conditions;
· the Group may have constraints in responding to changing market conditions or in pursuing favourable business opportunities;
· the Group may be limited in its ability to borrow additional funds; and
· the Group may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to competitors that have less debt and/or less onerous contractual obligations.
In addition to existing debt obligations, from time to time the Group may enter into transactions to acquire assets or shares of other companies, or to contract new-buildings. These transactions along with the Group's ongoing operations may be financed partially or wholly with debt, which may increase the Group's debt levels. Depending on future investment plans, the Group may require additional financing, which may not be available or, if available, may not be available on favourable terms. Failure to obtain such financing on a timely basis could cause the Group to forfeit or forego various opportunities. Failure to obtain financing on attractive terms may result in increased financing costs and could adversely affect the Group's earnings and financial position.
2.2.2 Exchange rate fluctuations
Currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency devaluations could have a material impact on the Group's results of operations from time to time. Historically, most of the Group's revenue and operating expenses have been generated in U.S.$, NOK and British pounds, but the Group predominantly sells its products and services in U.S.$ while a higher portion of the operating expenses are incurred in NOK and British pounds. A depreciation in the U.S.$ compared to these other currencies would adversely affect the Group's reported results of operations because expenses denominated in NOK or British pounds would be converted into U.S.$, the Company's reporting currency, at an increased value.
16

Although the Group may periodically undertake limited hedging activities in an attempt to reduce some currency fluctuation risks, these activities do not provide complete protection from currency-related losses. In addition, in some circumstances our hedging activities can require the Group to make cash outlays. Finally, the amount of currency hedging transactions the Group is able to enter into may be limited due to the fact that the Company has a non investment grade credit rating.
2.2.3 Fresh-start reporting and change from U.S. GAAP to IFRS may make the historical financial statements difficult to compare
In connection with the November 2003 consummation of PGS' reorganisation plan, PGS adopted, as of 1 November 2003, fresh-start reporting in accordance with US requirements. Because such requirements obliged PGS to reset its assets and liabilities to then current fair values, the Company's financial condition and results of operations after the reorganisation are not comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in the historical financial statements for periods prior to November 2003. This may make it difficult to assess the Group's performance for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 compared to the performance for fiscal years 2003 and 2002.
In addition, effective 1 January 2007, the Company changed its basis for financial reporting from U.S. GAAP, which was applied through the year ended 31 December 2006, to International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"). The Company's financial reporting under IFRS differs in certain respects from U.S. GAAP, and these differences could be material. The Company has separately reported the effects of changing to IFRS to the market, including the impact on its financial statements for 2006. The change from U.S. GAAP to IFRS makes the Company's financial reports difficult to compare to financial reports for earlier years.
2.2.4 Risks associated with taxation
As a multinational organisation, the Group is subject to taxation in many jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws. The amounts of taxes the Group pays in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in these laws or their interpretations by the relevant taxing authorities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's liquidity and results of operations. In addition, those authorities could review tax returns and impose additional taxes and penalties, which could be material. The Company has identified issues in several jurisdictions that could eventually make the Group liable to pay material amounts in taxes relating to prior years. Additional issues that the Company is not currently aware of may be identified in the future.
2.3 Risk related to the Notes
In addition to the above described risk factors (which also apply for the Notes), the following risks apply specifically to the Notes:
17

2.3.1 Liquidity risk
No market-maker agreement has been made in connection with the Notes, which may represent a liquidity risk for the investor. Further, no liquid market has existed for the Notes and it is not possible to predict whether, if the Notes are listed on the Oslo Børs, this will provide satisfactory liquidity in the Notes.
2.3.2 Market risk
The price of the Notes will depend on circumstances related to the Company and the Group, and in the oil and offshore industry in general. The price will also depend on general fluctuation in the industrial bond market.

2.3.3

It may be difficult for investors based in the United States to enforce civil liabilities predicated on U.S. securities laws against the Company, its affiliates, directors and officers

The Company is organised under the laws of Norway. Some of the Company's directors and officers reside outside of the United States, and the substantial parts of the Group's assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors in the United States to effect service of process within the United States upon the Company or the Company's directors and officers that reside outside of the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated on the civil liability provisions of U.S. Federal securities laws against the Company or the Company's directors and officers. In addition, punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may be unenforceable in Norway.

2.3.4 Notes may not be a suitable investmentfor all investors
Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

· have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus or any applicable supplement;

· have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio;

· understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behavior of financial markets in which they participate; and

· be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.

18

2.3.5 The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity
In the event that the Company would be obliged to increase the amounts payable in respect of any Notes due to any withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or on behalf of any authority therein or thereof having power to tax, the Company may redeem all outstanding Notes.

In addition, the Notes are redeemable at the Company's option in certain other limited circumstances and accordingly the Company may choose to redeem the outstanding Notes at times when prevailing interest rates may be relatively low. In such circumstances an investor may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that of the Notes.

2.3.6 Noteholders will bear the risk offluctuation in the price of the Company's shares
The market price of the Notes is expected to be affected by fluctuations in the market price of the Company's shares and it is impossible to predict whether the price of the shares will rise or fall. Trading prices of the shares will be influenced by, among other things, the financial position of the Company, the results of operations and political, economic, financial and other factors. Any decline in the price of the shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes.

Future issues or sales of the shares may significantly affect the trading price of the Notes or the shares. The future issue of shares by the Company or the disposal of shares by any of the major shareholders of the Company or the perception that such issues or sales may occur may significantly affect the trading price of the Notes and the shares.

2.3.7

Rights to receive payment on the Notes are subordinated to the Company's secured indebtedness and structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and liabilities o f the Company's subsidiaries

Certain of the Group's properties and assets are being used to secure its existing debt. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any of the Company's secured obligations with respect to the assets that secure such obligations. The terms of the Notes do not prevent any of the Company or its subsidiaries from incurring additional debt and the Company's subsidiaries are generally permitted to secure their indebtedness (subject to the provisions of Condition 2 - see "Terms and Conditions of the Notes - Negative Pledge"). In addition, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities and obligations of the Company's subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of such entities will have priority over the assets of such entities over the Company and its creditors, including the Noteholders.

2.3.8 As the Notes are cleared through VPS, investors will have to rely on VPS' procedures for transfers, payments and conversion of Notes

19

The Notes will clear through VPS. Pursuant to the rules and procedures of VPS, investors will not be entitled to receive Notes in definitive form. VPS will maintain a register in which it will record details of the holders of the Notes. Investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only through VPS.
The Company will discharge its payment obligations under the Notes by making payments through VPS for distribution to its account holders. A holder of a beneficial interest in a Bond must rely on the procedures of VPS to receive payments under the Notes and to receive delivery of the Company's shares upon conversion of Notes. The Company has no responsibility or liability for the records relating to beneficial interests in the Notes.
2.3.9 Transfer o f the Notes may be restricted by law
The Company has not, and will not, register the Notes under the US Securities Act, as amended. Holders of the Notes may not offer or sell the Notes in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the US Securities Act. Further, an offer or sale of the Notes in other jurisdictions may be restricted. It is the obligation of each Noteholder to ensure that offers and sales of the Notes comply with applicable laws.

5.4 Corporate authorisations
At the Board of Directors' meeting held 3 December 2007, the Company approved the issue of U.S.$ 400,000,000 2.7 per cent. Convertible Notes due 2012 convertible into Ordinary Shares of the Company. The Notes have been issued in accordance with the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act. The Notes have a final maturity date of 3 December 2012. The effective interest is equal to the nominal interest as of the date of issuance.

The net proceeds from the Notes has been used to the refinancing of a bridge facility of U.S.$ 450,000,000 which has been utilised to finance the Acquisition, and will further be used for general corporate purposes.

22

The Notes are issued pursuant to an authorisation granted by the Company's shareholders in the annual general meeting held 15 June 2007. The authorisation reads:
(i) The Company may raise convertible loans at a total amount of NOK 3.500.000.000. The Board of Directors are authorised to negotiate and enter into convertible loan agreements within the limits and in accordance with the terms of this authorisation.
(ii) The share capital of the Company may be increased by a total of NOK 54,000,000 as a result of the loans raised being converted into equity.
(iii) The shareholders'preferential rights to subscribe the loans may be set aside. (iv) The authorisation shall be effective from the date it is registered in the Norwegian
Register of Business Enterprises and shall be valid for a period of one year from its effective date.
At the Board of Directors' meeting held 3 December 2007, the Board of Directors utilised the authorisation granted by the shareholders as follows:
a. The Company shall issue Notes with an aggregate principal amount of USD 400,000,000 by which the holders of such Notes (the lenders) shall have the right to demand issuance of shares in the Company by setting off the debt against the Company (convertible notes).
b. The persons listed in Appendix 1 will subscribe the Notes, and each investor subscribes for such part of the Notes and against such consideration as set out in item e) below. The existing shareholders' preferential right is set aside, cf. Section 11-4 o f the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act.
c. The Notes shall be subscribed by 31 December 2007 and subscription shall take place by way of a designated subscription form, cf. Section 11-5 first paragraph, cf. Section 10-7 of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act.
d. The nominal value of the Notes shall be USD 100,000. The exchange rate between USD and NOK shall be fixed such that one USD equals 5.5188 NOK. The conversion price is NOK 216.19. Consequently each Note entitles the holder to 2552.732 shares upon conversion which equal a maximum share capital increase of NOK 30,632,782. The interest shall be 2.7% and as further set out in the "Terms and Conditions for the Notes ". Interest shall be paid semi-annually in arrear. The Notes shall be repaid in its entirety 3 December 2012 (the "Final Maturity Date"). The Notes shall be paid to account no. 5012.04.43345.
e. The Notes shall be subscribed at nominal value. f. The Notes shall be paid to the company by 1 February 2008. g. At conversion of the Notes NOK 3 per share shall be paid for each share with
nominal value NOK 3. Payment of the share contribution is made by set off against the nominal value of the Notes. The balance between the nominal value of the shares and the value of the Notes is added to the Company's premiumfund. In the case that the nominal value of the Company's shares is changed during the term of the loan, an amount similar to the new nominal value shall be paid per share at conversion of the Notes. Only the debt can be converted. Should the nominal value of the debt not be divisible by the conversion price, it shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. The Noteholders will have the right to receive any amount not
23

used in connection with the rounding off in cash and as further set out in item 6 (a) of the "Terms and Conditions for the Notes". Interest accrued since the latest interest due date, but notfallen due by the conversion date will not be converted into shares. When the conversion right is exercised, the Company's share capital will be increased without the holding of a general meeting. The Company shall ensure that the share capital increase resulting from the conversion is registered with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises without undue delay. The Board gives the management of the Company the authority to issue shares in connection with the conversion. h. A demand for conversion may be presented at any time during the term of the Notes, for the whole or parts of the Notes, on several occasions, but must be presented at the latest on the date falling six days prior to the Final Maturity Date. i. Shares acquired by conversion shall be equal with the other ordinary shares in the Company and give right to dividend payments from the time of issuance. j. Issuance o f new shares in the Company when existing shareholders have preferential rights, issuance of financial instruments as described in Chapter 11 of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act, share capital decrease with payment to the Company's shareholders, funds issue, share split, share splice, dividend payments, completion of mergers and de-mergers and other changes to the Company's share capital that are not in the bond holders interest, shall entail an adjustment of the conversion price such as to maintain the value of the conversion right. Item 6 (b) of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes gives further provisions as to adjustment to the conversion price. k. The subscription right may not be separatedfrom the debt. l. Further, the terms and conditions set out in "Terms and Conditions for the Notes" dated 3 December 2007 (enclosed with the calling notice for this board meeting and attached to these minutes as Appendix 2) apply and are hereby approved.

No transfer of a Note will be valid unless and until entered on the Register. A Note may be registered only in the name of, and transferred only to, a person holding a VPS Account.
(c) Formalities Free of Charge
Such transfer will be effected without charge subject to (i) the person making such application for transfer paying or procuring the payment of any taxes, duties and other governmental charges in connection therewith and (ii) the Registrar being satisfied with the documents of title and/or identity of the person making the application.

The Notes bear interest from and including the Closing Date at the rate of 2.70 per cent. per annum (the "Interest Rate") calculated by reference to the principal amount thereof and payable semi-annually in equal instalments in arrear on 3 June and 3 December in each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), save that the first
35

payment of interest will be made on 3 June 2008 in respect of the period from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) 3 June 2008.
Where interest is required to be calculated for any period which is not an Interest Period, it will be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year consisting of 12 months of 30 days each, and in the case of an incomplete month, the number of days elapsed.
"Interest Period" means the payment period beginning on (and including) the Closing Date and ending on (but excluding) the first Interest Payment Date and each successive period beginning on (and including) an Interest Payment Date and ending on (but excluding) the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.
(b) Accrual of Interest

6 Conversion of Notes
(a) Conversion Period and Conversion Price
Subject as provided below, each Note shall entitle the holder (a "Conversion Right") to convert ("Conversion") such Note into new and/or existing Ordinary Shares, credited as fully paid, subject to and as provided in these Conditions.
The number of Ordinary Shares to be issued or delivered on exercise of a Conversion Right shall be determined by dividing the principal amount of the relevant Note to be converted (translated into NOK at the fixed rate of NOK 5.5188 = U.S.$1.00) by the conversion price (the "Conversion Price") in effect on the relevant Conversion Date.
The initial Conversion Price is NOK 216.19 per Ordinary Share. The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment in the circumstances described in Condition 6(b).
A Noteholder may exercise the Conversion Right in respect of a Note by delivering a Conversion Notice (as defined in Condition 6(h)) to the specified office of the
36

Paying and Conversion Agent in accordance with Condition 6(h) whereupon the Issuer shall (subject as provided in these Conditions) procure the delivery, to or as directed by the relevant Noteholder of Ordinary Shares credited as paid up in full as provided in this Condition 6.
Subject to, and as provided in these Conditions, the Conversion Right in respect of a Note may be exercised, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time (subject to any applicable fiscal or other laws or regulations and as hereinafter provided) from 30 January 2008 to the close of business (in the place where the specified office of the Paying and Conversion Agent is located) on the date falling six days prior to the Final Maturity Date (both days inclusive) or, if the Notes shall have been called for redemption pursuant to Condition 7(b) or 7(c) prior to the Final Maturity Date, then up to the close of business (at the place aforesaid) on the sixth day before the date fixed for redemption thereof pursuant to Condition 7(b) or 7(c), unless there shall be default in making payment in respect of such Note on such date fixed for redemption, in which event the Conversion Right shall extend up to the close of business (at the place aforesaid) on the date on which the full amount of such payment becomes available for payment and notice of such availability has been duly given in accordance with Condition 16 or, if earlier, the Final Maturity Date; provided that, in each case, if the final such date for the exercise of Conversion Rights is not a business day at the place aforesaid, then the period for exercise of the Conversion Right by Noteholders shall end on the immediately preceding business day at the place aforesaid.
Conversion Rights may not be exercised (i) following the giving of notice by the Trustee pursuant to Condition 10 or (ii) in respect of a Note which the relevant holder has exercised its right to require the Issuer to redeem pursuant to Condition 7(e).
Conversion Rights may not be exercised by a Noteholder in circumstances where the relevant Conversion Date would fall during the period commencing on the Record Date in respect of any payment of interest on the Notes and ending on the relevant Interest Payment Date (both days inclusive).
The period during which Conversion Rights may (subject as provided below) be exercised by a Noteholder is referred to as the "Conversion Period".
Conversion Rights may only be exercised in respect of an authorised denomination.
Fractions of Ordinary Shares will not be delivered on conversion or pursuant to Condition 6(c). However, the Issuer will make a cash payment to the relevant exercising Noteholder in respect of any such fraction equal to the product of the closing price of an Ordinary Share on the relevant Conversion Date as published by or derived from the Relevant Stock Exchange multiplied by such fraction and converted into U.S. dollars at the Prevailing Rate. Payment of any such amount
37

shall be made by transfer to a U.S. dollar account in New York as specified in the relevant Conversion Notice. If the Conversion Right in respect of more than one Note is exercised at any one time such that Ordinary Shares to be delivered on conversion or pursuant to Condition 6(c) are to be registered in the same name, the number of such Ordinary Shares to be delivered in respect thereof shall be calculated on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes being so converted and rounded down to the nearest whole number of Ordinary Shares.
The Issuer will procure that Ordinary Shares to be delivered or transferred on conversion will be delivered or transferred in electronic form to the holder of the Notes completing the relevant Conversion Notice or his nominee by entry with the VPS Account of such holder of the Notes or his nominee as soon as possible and on or about the relevant Delivery Date. Such Ordinary Shares will be deemed to be issued or delivered as of the relevant Delivery Date. The Issuer will procure that any Additional Ordinary Shares to be issued and delivered pursuant to Condition 6(c) will be deemed to be issued and delivered as of the date the relevant Retroactive Adjustment takes effect or as at the date of issue of Ordinary Shares if the adjustment results from the issue of Ordinary Shares (each such date, the "Reference Date").
Pursuant to Norwegian company law, no Ordinary Shares shall be deemed issued until (i) the issue of such Ordinary Shares has been approved by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer (or by the management of Issuer if the Board of Directors have authorised the management to issue Ordinary Shares in connection with the exercise of Conversion Rights in respect of the Notes), (ii) the statutory auditor of the Issuer has confirmed that the Ordinary Shares to be issued are fully paid up, (iii) the applicable share capital increase has been registered by the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises and (iv) the Ordinary Shares have been entered with the VPS.

(b) Adjustment of Conversion Price

Upon the happening of any of the events described below, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted as follows:

(i)

If and whenever there shall be a consolidation, reclassification or

subdivision in relation to the Ordinary Shares, the Conversion Price shall

be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior

to such consolidation, reclassification or subdivision by the following

fraction:

A B
where:

38

A = is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately before such consolidation, reclassification or subdivision, as the case may be; and
B = is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately after, and as a result of, such consolidation, reclassification or subdivision, as the case may be.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the date the consolidation, reclassification or subdivision, as the case may be, takes effect.
(ii) If and whenever the Issuer shall issue any Ordinary Shares credited as fully paid to the Shareholders by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves (including any share premium account or capital redemption reserve) other than (1) where any such Ordinary Shares issued instead of the whole or part of a Dividend in cash which the Shareholders would or could otherwise have received or (2) where the Shareholders may elect to receive a Dividend in cash in lieu of such Ordinary Shares, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such issue by the following fraction:

A B
where:

A is the aggregate nominal amount of the issued Ordinary Shares immediately before such issue; and

B

is the aggregate nominal amount of the issued Ordinary Shares

immediately after such issue.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the date such Ordinary Shares

have been entered with the VPS.

(iii) If and whenever the Issuer shall pay or make any Dividend to Shareholders, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to the relevant Dividend by the following fraction:

A- B A
where:

A is the Current Market Price of one Ordinary Share on the dealing day immediately preceding the date of the first public announcement of the relevant Dividend or, in the case of a purchase of Ordinary Shares or any receipts or certificates

39

representing shares by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer, on which such Ordinary Shares are purchased or, in the case of a Spin-Off, is the mean of the Volume Weighted Average Prices of an Ordinary Share for the five consecutive dealing days ending on the dealing day immediately preceding the first date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex- the relevant Spin-Off; and
B is the portion of the Fair Market Value, with such portion being determined by dividing the Fair Market Value of the aggregate Dividend by the number of Ordinary Shares entitled to receive the relevant Dividend (or, in the case of a purchase of Ordinary Shares or any receipts or certificates representing shares by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer, by the number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately prior to such purchase), of the Dividend attributable to one Ordinary Share.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the date on which the relevant Dividend is paid or made or, in the case of a purchase of Ordinary Shares or any receipts or certificates representing Ordinary Shares, on the date such purchase is made or, in any such case if later, the first date upon which the Fair Market Value of the relevant Dividend is capable of being determined as provided herein.
For the purposes of the above, the Fair Market Value of a Cash Dividend shall (subject as provided in paragraph (a) of the definition of "Dividend" and in the definition of "Fair Market Value") be determined as at the date of the first public announcement of the relevant Dividend, and in the case of a Non-Cash Dividend, the Fair Market Value of the relevant Dividend shall be the Fair Market Value of the relevant Spin-Off Securities or, as the case may be, the relevant property or assets.
"Non-Cash Dividend" means any Dividend which is not a Cash Dividend, and shall include a Spin-Off.
"Cash Dividend" means (i) any Dividend which is to be paid or made in cash (in whatever currency), but other than falling within paragraph (b) of the definition of "Spin-Off" and (ii) any Dividend determined to be a Cash Dividend pursuant to paragraph (a) of the definition of "Dividend", and for the avoidance of doubt, a Dividend falling within paragraph (c) or (d) of the definition of "Dividend" shall be treated as being a Non-Cash Dividend.
(iv) If and whenever the Issuer shall issue Ordinary Shares to Shareholders as a class by way of rights, or issue or grant to Shareholders as a class by way of rights, options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any
40

Ordinary Shares, in each case at a price per Ordinary Share which is less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on the dealing day immediately preceding the date of the first public announcement of the terms of the issue or grant of such Ordinary Shares, options, warrants or other rights, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such issue or grant by the following fraction:
A+B A+C
where:
A is the number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately before such announcement;
B is the number of Ordinary Shares which the aggregate amount (if any) payable for the Ordinary Shares issued by way of rights, or for the options or warrants or other rights issued by way of rights and for the total number of Ordinary Shares deliverable on the exercise thereof, would purchase at such Current Market Price per Ordinary Share; and
C is the number of Ordinary Shares issued or, as the case may be, the maximum number of Ordinary Shares which may be issued upon exercise of such options, warrants or rights calculated as at the date of issue of such options, warrants or rights.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the first date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex-rights, ex-options or ex-warrants on the Relevant Stock Exchange.
(v) If and whenever the Issuer shall issue any Securities (other than Ordinary Shares or options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any Ordinary Shares) to Shareholders as a class by way of rights or grant to Shareholders as a class by way of rights any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any Securities (other than Ordinary Shares or options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase Ordinary Shares), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such issue or grant by the following fraction:
A- B A
where:
A is the Current Market Price of one Ordinary Share on the dealing
41

day immediately preceding the first date on which the terms of such issue or grant are publicly announced; and B is the Fair Market Value on the date of such announcement of the portion of the rights attributable to one Ordinary Share. Such adjustment shall become effective on the first date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex-rights, ex-options or ex-warrants on the Relevant Stock Exchange.
(vi) If and whenever the Issuer shall issue (otherwise than as mentioned in sub paragraph (&)(iv) above) wholly for cash any Ordinary Shares (other than Ordinary Shares issued on conversion of the Notes or on the exercise of any rights of conversion into, or exchange or subscription for or purchase of, Ordinary Shares) or issue or grant (otherwise than as mentioned in sub paragraph (&)(iv) above) wholly for cash any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any Ordinary Shares (other than the Notes, which term shall for this purpose include any further notes issued pursuant to Condition 17 and forming a single series with the Notes), in each case at a price per Ordinary Share which is less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on the dealing day immediately preceding the date of the first public announcement of the terms of such issue or grant, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such issue or grant by the following fraction:
A+B A+C
where:
A is the number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately before the issue of such Ordinary Shares or the grant of such options, warrants or rights;
B is the number of Ordinary Shares which the aggregate consideration (if any) receivable for the issue of such Ordinary Shares or, as the case may be, for the Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the exercise of any such options, warrants or rights, would purchase at such Current Market Price per Ordinary Share; and
C is the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to such issue of such Ordinary Shares or, as the case may be, the maximum number of Ordinary Shares which may be issued upon exercise of such options, warrants or rights calculated as at the
42

date of issue of such options, warrants or rights. Such adjustment shall become effective on the date such Ordinary Shares have been entered with the VPS or, as the case may be, the grant of such options, warrants or rights.
(vii) If and whenever the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer or (at the direction or request of or pursuant to any arrangements with the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer) any other company, person or entity (otherwise than as mentioned in sub-paragraphs (b)(iv), (b)(v) or (b)(vi) above) shall issue wholly for cash or for no consideration any Securities (other than the Notes, which term shall for this purpose exclude any further notes issued pursuant to Condition 17 and forming a single series with the Notes), which by their terms of issue carry (directly or indirectly) rights of conversion into, or exchange or subscription for, Ordinary Shares (or shall grant any such rights in respect of existing Securities so issued) or Securities which by their terms might be redesignated as Ordinary Shares, and the consideration per Ordinary Share receivable upon conversion, exchange, subscription or redesignation is less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on the dealing day immediately preceding the date of the first public announcement by the Issuer or any Subsidiary as mentioned above of the terms of issue of such Securities (or the terms of such grant), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such issue (or grant) by the following fraction:
A+B A+C
where:
A is the number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately before such issue or grant (but where the relevant Securities carry rights of conversion into or rights of exchange or subscription for Ordinary Shares which have been issued by the Issuer for the purposes of or in connection with such issue, less the number of such Ordinary Shares so issued);
B is the number of Ordinary Shares which the aggregate consideration (if any) receivable for the Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon conversion or exchange or upon exercise of the right of subscription attached to such Securities or, as the case may be, for the Ordinary Shares to be issued or to arise from any such redesignation would purchase at such Current Market Price per Ordinary Share; and
43

C is the maximum number of Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon conversion or exchange of such Securities or upon the exercise of such right of subscription attached thereto at the initial conversion, exchange or subscription price or rate or, as the case may be, the maximum number of Ordinary Shares which may be issued or arise from any such redesignation.
Provided that if at the time of issue of the relevant Securities or date of grant of such rights (as used in this sub-paragraph (b)(vii) the "Specified Date") such number of Ordinary Shares is to be determined by reference to the application of a formula or other variable feature or the occurrence of any event at some subsequent time (which may be when such Securities are converted or exchanged or rights of subscription are exercised or, as the case may be, such Securities are redesignated or at such other time as may be provided) then for the purposes of this sub-paragraph (b)(vii), "C" shall be determined by the application of such formula or variable feature or as if the relevant event occurs or had occurred as at the Specified Date and as if such conversion, exchange, subscription, purchase or acquisition or, as the case may be, redesignation had taken place on the Specified Date.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the date of issue of such Securities or, as the case may be, the grant of such rights.
(viii) If and whenever there shall be any modification of the rights of conversion, exchange or subscription attaching to any such Securities (other than the Notes, which term shall for this purpose include any further notes issued pursuant to Condition 17 and forming a single series with the Notes) as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (b)(vii) above (other than in accordance with the terms (including terms as to adjustment) applicable to such Securities upon issue) so that following such modification the consideration per Ordinary Share receivable has been reduced and is less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on the dealing day immediately preceding the date of the first public announcement by the Issuer or any Subsidiary as mentioned above of the proposals for such modification, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such modification by the following fraction:
A+B A+C
where:
44

A is the number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately before such modification (but where the relevant Securities carry rights of conversion into or rights of exchange or subscription for Ordinary Shares which have been issued, purchased or acquired by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer (or at the direction or request or pursuant to any arrangements with the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer) for the purposes of or in connection with such issue, less the number of such Ordinary Shares so issued, purchased or acquired);
B is the number of Ordinary Shares which the aggregate consideration (if any) receivable for the Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon conversion or exchange or upon exercise of the right of subscription attached to the Securities so modified would purchase at such Current Market Price per Ordinary Share or, if lower, the existing conversion, exchange or subscription price of such Securities; and
C is the maximum number of Ordinary Shares which may be issued or otherwise made available upon conversion or exchange of such Securities or upon the exercise of such rights of subscription attached thereto at the modified conversion, exchange or subscription price or rate but giving credit in such manner as an Independent Financial Adviser shall consider appropriate for any previous adjustment under this sub-paragraph (b)(viii) or sub paragraph (b)(vii) above.
Provided that if at the time of such modification (as used in this sub paragraph (b)(viii) the "Specified Date") such number of Ordinary Shares is to be determined by reference to the application of a formula or other variable feature or the occurrence of any event at some subsequent time (which may be when such Securities are converted or exchanged or rights of subscription are exercised or at such other time as may be provided) then for the purposes of this sub-paragraph (b)(viii), "C" shall be determined by the application of such formula or variable feature or as if the relevant event occurs or had occurred as at the Specified Date and as if such conversion, exchange or subscription had taken place on the Specified Date.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the date of modification of the rights of conversion, exchange or subscription attaching to such Securities.
(ix) If and whenever the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer or (at the direction or request of or pursuant to any arrangements with the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer) any other company, person or entity shall
45

offer any Securities in connection with which offer Shareholders as a class are entitled to participate in arrangements whereby such Securities may be acquired by them (except where the Conversion Price falls to be adjusted under sub-paragraphs (b)(ii), (iii), (iv), (vi) or (vii) above or (x) below (or would fall to be so adjusted if the relevant issue or grant was at less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on the relevant dealing day) or under sub-paragraph (b)(v) above) the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately before the making of such offer by the following fraction:

A- B A
where:

A is the Current Market Price of one Ordinary Share on the dealing day immediately preceding the date on which the terms of such offer are first publicly announced; and
B is the Fair Market Value on the date of such public announcement by the Issuer or any Subsidiary as mentioned above of the portion of the relevant offer attributable to one Ordinary Share.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the first date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex-rights on the Relevant Stock Exchange.
(x) If a Change of Control shall occur, then upon any exercise of Conversion Rights where the Conversion Date falls during the Change of Control Period, the Conversion Price (the "Change of Control Conversion Price") shall be determined as set out below, but in each case adjusted, if appropriate, under this Condition 6(b).
COCCP = OCP/(1+ (CP x c/t))
where:

COCCP OCP CP c
t

means the Change of Control Conversion Price means the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control
means 40 per cent. (expressed as fraction) means the number of days from and including the date the Change of Control occurs to but excluding the Final Maturity Date
means the number of days from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the Final Maturity Date

46

(xi) If the Issuer determines that an adjustment should be made to the Conversion Price as a result of one or more circumstances not referred to above in this Condition 6(b) (even if the relevant circumstance is specifically excluded from the operation of sub-paragraphs (b)(i) to (x) above), the Issuer shall, at its own expense and acting reasonably, request an Independent Financial Adviser to determine as soon as practicable what adjustment (if any) to the Conversion Price is fair and reasonable to take account thereof and the date on which such adjustment should take effect and upon such determination such adjustment (if any) shall be made and shall take effect in accordance with such determination, provided that an adjustment shall only be made pursuant to this sub-paragraph (b)(xi) if such Independent Financial Adviser is so requested to make such a determination not more than 21 days after the date on which the relevant circumstance arises and if the adjustment would result in a reduction to the Conversion Price.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment pursuant to this Condition 6(b) have already resulted or will result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price or where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment arise by virtue of any other events or circumstances which have already given or will give rise to an adjustment to the Conversion Price or where more than one event which gives rise to an adjustment to the Conversion Price occurs within such a short period of time that, in the opinion of the Issuer, a modification to the operation of the adjustment provisions is required to give the intended result, such modification shall be made to the operation of the adjustment provisions as may be advised by an Independent Financial Adviser to be in its opinion appropriate to give the intended result and provided further that, for the avoidance of doubt, the issue of Ordinary Shares pursuant to the exercise of Conversion Rights shall not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price.
For the purpose of any calculation of the consideration receivable or price pursuant to sub-paragraphs (b)(iv), (vi), (vii) and (viii), the following provisions shall apply:
(a) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary Shares issued for cash shall be the amount of such cash;
(b) (x) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the conversion or exchange of any Securities shall be deemed to be the consideration or price received or receivable for any such Securities and (y) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the exercise of rights of subscription attached to any Securities or upon the exercise of any options, warrants or rights shall be
47

deemed to be that part (which may be the whole) of the consideration or price received or receivable for such Securities or, as the case may be, for such options, warrants or rights which are attributed by the Issuer to such rights of subscription or, as the case may be, such options, warrants or rights or, if no part of such consideration or price is so attributed, the Fair Market Value of such rights of subscription or, as the case may be, such options, warrants or rights as at the date of the first public announcement of the terms of issue of such Securities or, as the case may be, such options, warrants or rights, plus in the case of each of (x) and (y) above, the additional minimum consideration receivable or price (if any) upon the conversion or exchange of such Securities, or upon the exercise of such rights or subscription attached thereto or, as the case may be, upon exercise of such options, warrants or rights and (z) the consideration receivable or price per Ordinary Share upon the conversion or exchange of, or upon the exercise of such rights of subscription attached to, such Securities or, as the case may be, upon the exercise of such options, warrants or rights shall be the aggregate consideration or price referred to in (x) or (y) above (as the case may be) divided by the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued upon such conversion or exchange or exercise at the initial conversion, exchange or subscription price or rate;
(c) if the consideration or price determined pursuant to (a) or (b) above (or any component thereof) shall be expressed in a currency other than Norwegian Kroner it shall be converted into Norwegian Kroner at such rate of exchange as may be determined in good faith by an Independent Financial Adviser to be the spot rate ruling at the close of business on the date of the first public announcement of the terms of issue of such Securities (or if no such rate is available on that date, the equivalent rate on the immediately preceding date on which such rate is available); and
(d) in determining consideration or price pursuant to the above, no deduction shall be made for any commissions or fees (howsoever described) or any expenses paid or incurred for any underwriting, placing or management of the issue of the relevant Ordinary Shares or Securities or otherwise in connection therewith.
(c) Retroactive Adjustments
If the Delivery Date in relation to the conversion of any Note shall be after any consolidation, reclassification or sub-division as is mentioned in Condition 6(b)(i), or after the record date or other due date for the establishment of entitlement for any such issue, distribution, grant or offer (as the case may be) as is mentioned in Condition 6(b)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (ix), or after any such issue or grant as is mentioned in Conditions 6(b)(vi) and (vii), in any case in circumstances where the
48

relevant Conversion Date falls before the relevant adjustment becomes effective under Condition 6 (b) (such adjustment, a "Retroactive Adjustment"), then the Issuer shall (conditional upon the relevant adjustment becoming effective) procure that there shall be issued or delivered to the converting Noteholder, in accordance with the instructions contained in the Conversion Notice, such additional number of Ordinary Shares (if any) (the "Additional Ordinary Shares") as, together with the Ordinary Shares issued or to be issued or delivered on conversion of the relevant Note (together with any fraction of an Ordinary Share not so issued), is equal to the number of Ordinary Shares which would have been required to be issued or delivered on conversion of such Note if the relevant adjustment (more particularly referred to in the said provisions of Condition 6 (b )) to the Conversion Price had in fact been made and become effective immediately prior to the relevant Conversion Date.
(d) D ecision o f an Independent F inancial A d viser
If any doubt shall arise as to the appropriate adjustment to the Conversion Price, and following consultation between the Issuer and an Independent Financial Adviser, a written opinion of such Independent Financial Adviser in respect of such adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be conclusive and binding on all concerned, save in the case of manifest error.
(e) E m ployees 'Share Schem es
No adjustment will be made to the Conversion Price where Ordinary Shares or other Securities (including rights, warrants and options) are issued, offered, exercised, allotted, appropriated, modified or granted to, or for the benefit of, employees or former employees (including Directors holding or formerly holding executive office or the personal service company of any such person) or their spouses or relatives, in each case, of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any associated company or to trustees to be held for the benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to any employees' share or option scheme.
(f) R o u n d in g D o w n a n d N o tice o f A d ju stm e n t to the C o n versio n P rice
On any adjustment, the resultant Conversion Price, if not an integral multiple of NOK 0.01, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of NOK 0.01. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price where such adjustment (rounded down if applicable) would be less than one per cent. of the Conversion Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any amount by which the Conversion Price has been rounded down, shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and such subsequent adjustment shall be made on the basis that the adjustment not required to be made had been made at the relevant time.
49

Notice of any adjustments to the Conversion Price shall be given by the Issuer to Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 and the Trustee promptly after the determination thereof.

The Conversion Price shall not in any event be reduced to below the nominal value of the Ordinary Shares and the Issuer undertakes that it shall not take any action, and shall procure that no action is taken, that would otherwise result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price to below such nominal value.

(g) Change of Control

Within 14 calendar days following the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Issuer shall give notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 (a "Change of Control Notice"). Such notice shall contain a statement informing Noteholders of their entitlement to exercise their Conversion Rights as provided in these Conditions, or to exercise their rights to require redemption of their Notes pursuant to Condition 7(e).

The Change of Control Notice shall also specify:

(i)

all information material to Noteholders concerning the Change of Control;

(ii) the Conversion Price immediately prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control and the Change of Control Conversion Price applicable pursuant to Condition 6(b)(x) during the Change of Control Period;

(iii) the closing price of the Ordinary Shares as derived from the Relevant Stock Exchange as at the latest practicable date prior to the publication of such notice;

(iv) the last day of the Change of Control Period;

(v) the Change of Control Put Date (as defined in Condition 7(e)); and

(vi) such other information relating to the Change of Control as the Trustee may require.

The Trustee shall not be required to take any steps to ascertain whether a Change of Control or any event which could lead to a Change of Control has occurred or may occur.

(h) Procedure for exercise of Conversion Rights

The Conversion Right may be exercised by a Noteholder during the Conversion Period by delivering a duly completed and signed notice of conversion (a "Conversion Notice") in the form (for the time being current) obtainable from the Paying and Conversion Agent to the specified office of the Paying and Conversion Agent, during its usual business hours. Conversion Rights shall be exercised subject in each case to any applicable fiscal or other laws or regulations applicable in the jurisdiction in which the specified office of the Paying and Conversion Agent is

50

located. If such delivery is made after the end of normal business hours or on a day which is not a business day in the place of the specified office of the Paying and Conversion Agent, such delivery shall be deemed for all purposes of these Conditions to have been made on the next following such business day.

A Conversion Notice, once delivered, shall be irrevocable.

The conversion date in respect of a Note (the "Conversion Date") shall be the Oslo business day immediately following the date of the delivery of the Notes and the Conversion Notice and, if applicable, the making of any payment to be made as provided below.

A Noteholder exercising a Conversion Right must pay directly to the relevant authorities any taxes and capital, stamp, issue and registration duties arising on conversion (other than any taxes or capital duties or stamp duties payable in the Kingdom of Norway in respect of the allotment and issue of any Ordinary Shares on such conversion (including any Additional Ordinary Shares), which shall be paid by the Issuer) and such Noteholder must pay all, if any, taxes arising by reference to any disposal or deemed disposal of a Note or interest therein in connection with such conversion. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall not be responsible for determining whether such taxes or capital, stamp, issue or registration duties are payable or the amount of such taxes or capital, stamp, issue or registration duties and it shall not be responsible or liable for any failure by the Issuer to pay such taxes or capital, stamp, issue or registration duties.

Ordinary Shares to be issued or delivered on exercise of Conversion Rights will be issued or delivered in electronic form through the facilities of the VPS to such VPS Account as specified by the Noteholder in the relevant Conversion Notice.

The Issuer will take all necessary steps to procure that the Ordinary Shares to be issued or delivered on exercise of Conversion Rights are issued and/or delivered by no later than the Delivery Date (as defined below) and will promptly make all necessary filings with, and applications to, the Relevant Stock Exchange for the admission to listing and to trading of such Ordinary Shares.

(i) Ordinary Shares

(i)

Ordinary Shares issued or delivered upon conversion of the Notes will be

fully paid and will in all respects rank pari passu with the fully paid

Ordinary Shares in issue on the relevant Delivery Date or, in the case of

Additional Ordinary Shares, on the relevant Reference Date, except in any

such case for any right excluded by mandatory provisions of applicable

law except that such Ordinary Shares or, as the case may be, Additional

Ordinary Shares will not rank for any rights, distributions or payments the

record date or other due date for the establishment of entitlement for which

51

falls prior to the relevant Conversion Date or, as the case may be, the relevant Reference Date.
(ii) Save as provided in Condition 6(j), no payment or adjustment shall be made on conversion for any interest which otherwise would have accrued on the relevant Notes since the last Interest Payment Date preceding the Conversion Date relating to such Notes (or, if such Conversion Date falls before the first Interest Payment Date, since the Closing Date).
(j) Interest on Conversion
If any notice requiring the redemption of any Notes is given pursuant to Condition 7(b) or 7(c) on or after the fifteenth Oslo business day prior to a record date which has occurred since the last Interest Payment Date (or in the case of the first Interest Period, since the Closing Date) in respect of any Dividend or distribution payable in respect of the Ordinary Shares where such notice specifies a date for redemption falling on or prior to the date which is 14 days after the Interest Payment Date next following such record date, interest shall accrue at the applicable Interest Rate on Notes in respect of which Conversion Rights shall have been exercised and in respect of which the Conversion Date falls after such record date and on or prior to the Interest Payment Date next following such record date in respect of such Dividend or distribution, in each case from and including the preceding Interest Payment Date (or, if such Conversion Date falls before the first Interest Payment Date, from the Closing Date) to but excluding such Conversion Date. The Issuer shall pay any such interest by not later than 14 days after the relevant Conversion Date by transfer to a U.S. dollar account with a bank in New York in accordance with instructions given by the relevant Noteholder in the relevant Conversion Notice.
(k) Purchase or Redemption of Ordinary Shares
The Issuer may exercise such rights as it may from time to time enjoy to purchase or redeem or buy back its own shares (including Ordinary Shares) or any depositary or other receipts representing the same without the consent of the Noteholders.
(l) No duty to Monitor
The Trustee shall not be under any duty to monitor whether any event or circumstance has happened or exists which may require an adjustment to be made to the Conversion Price and will not be responsible to the Noteholders or any other person for any loss arising from any failure by it to do so.
(m) Consolidation, Amalgamation or Merger
Without prejudice to Condition 6(b)(x), in the case of any consolidation, amalgamation or merger of the Issuer with any other corporation (other than a consolidation, amalgamation or merger in which the Issuer is the continuing
52

corporation), or in the case of any sale or transfer of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Issuer, the Issuer will forthwith notify the Trustee and the Noteholders of such event and take such steps as shall be required by the Trustee (including the execution of a deed supplemental to or amending the Trust Deed) to ensure that each Note then outstanding will (during the period in which Conversion Rights may be exercised) be converted into the class and amount of shares and other securities and property receivable upon such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of Ordinary Shares which would have become liable to be issued upon exercise of Conversion Rights immediately prior to such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer. Such supplemental deed supplement or amendment will provide for adjustments which will be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Condition 6. The above provisions of this Condition 6(m) will apply, mutatis mutandis to any subsequent consolidations, amalgamations, mergers, sales or transfers.

7 Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation

(a) Final Redemption

Unless previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted as herein provided, the Notes will be redeemed at their principal amount on the Final Maturity Date. The Notes may only be redeemed at the option of the Issuer prior to the Final Maturity Date in accordance with Condition 7(b) or 7(c).

(b) Redemption at the Option of the Issuer

On giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice (an "Optional Redemption Notice") to the Trustee and to the Noteholders (which notice shall be irrevocable) in accordance with Condition 16, the Issuer may redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes on the date (the "Optional Redemption Date") specified in the Optional Redemption Notice at their principal amount, together with accrued but unpaid interest to such date:

(i)

at any time on or after 10 January 2011, if the Parity Value on at least 20

dealing days in any period of 30 consecutive dealing days ending not

earlier than 15 days prior to the giving of the relevant Optional

Redemption Notice, exceeds U.S.$130,000; or

(ii) if, at any time prior to the date on which the relevant Optional Redemption Notice is given, Conversion Rights shall have been exercised and/or purchases (and corresponding cancellations) and/or redemptions effected in respect of 85 per cent. or more in principal amount of the Notes originally issued; or

(iii) at any time within the period of 45 days after the end of the Change of Control Period.

53

(c) Redemption for Taxation Reasons
At any time the Issuer may, having given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice (a "Tax Redemption Notice") to the Noteholders (which notice shall be irrevocable) redeem (subject to the second following paragraph) all, and not some only, of the Notes at their principal amount ("Tax Redemption Date"), together with accrued but unpaid interest to such date, if (i) the Issuer satisfies the Trustee immediately prior to the giving of such notice that the Issuer has or will become obliged to pay additional amounts in respect of principal or interest pursuant to Condition 9 as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of the Kingdom of Norway or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, or any change in the general application or official interpretation of such laws or regulations, which change or amendment becomes effective on or after the Closing Date, and (ii) such obligation cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it, provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer would be obliged to pay such additional amounts were a payment in respect of the Notes then due. Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this paragraph, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee (a) a certificate signed by two Directors or duly appointed attorneys of the Issuer stating that the obligation referred to in (i) above cannot be avoided by the Issuer (taking reasonable measures available to it) and (b) an opinion of independent legal or tax advisers of recognised international standing to the effect that such change or amendment has occurred and that the Issuer is or will be obliged to pay such additional amounts as a result thereof (irrespective of whether such amendment or change is then effective) and the Trustee shall accept such certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the matters set out in (i) and (ii) above in which event it shall be conclusive and binding on the Noteholders.
Upon the expiry of a Tax Redemption Notice, the Issuer shall (subject to the next following paragraph) redeem the Notes at their principal amount, together with accrued interest to such date.
If the Issuer gives a notice of redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(c), each Noteholder will have the right to elect that his Note(s) shall not be redeemed and that the provisions of Condition 9 shall not apply in respect of any payment of interest to be made on such Note(s) which falls due after the relevant Tax Redemption Date whereupon no additional amounts shall be payable in respect thereof pursuant to Condition 9 and payment of all amounts shall be made subject to the deduction or withholding of the taxation required to be withheld or deducted by the Kingdom of Norway or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax. To exercise such right, the holder of the relevant Note must complete, sign and deposit at the specified office of any Paying and Conversion Agent a duly completed and signed notice of election, in the form for
54

the time being current, obtainable from the specified office of the Paying and Conversion Agent on or before the day falling 10 days prior to the Tax Redemption Date.
(d) Optional and Tax Redemption Notices
Any Optional Redemption or Tax Redemption Notice shall be irrevocable. Any such notice shall specify (i) the Optional Redemption Date or, as the case may be, the Tax Redemption Date, (ii) the Conversion Price, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding and the closing price of the Ordinary Shares as derived from the Relevant Stock Exchange, in each case as at the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Optional Redemption Notice or, as the case may be, the Tax Redemption Notice and (iii) the last day on which Conversion Rights may be exercised by Noteholders.
(e) Redemption at the option of Noteholders
Following the occurrence of a Change of Control, the holder of each Note will have the right to require the Issuer to redeem that Note on the Change of Control Put Date at its principal amount, together with accrued interest to such date. To exercise such right, the holder of the relevant Note must, at any time in the Change of Control Period, deliver a duly completed and signed notice of exercise, in the form for the time being current, obtainable from the specified office of the Paying and Conversion Agent (a "Change of Control Put Exercise Notice") at the specified office of the Paying and Conversion Agent. The "Change of Control Put Date" shall be the fourteenth calendar day after the expiry of the Change of Control Period.
Payment in respect of any such Note shall be made by transfer to a bank in New York specified by the relevant Noteholder in the applicable Change of Control Put Exercise Notice.
A Change of Control Put Exercise Notice, once delivered, shall be irrevocable and the Issuer shall redeem all Notes the subject of Change of Control Put Exercise Notices delivered as aforesaid on the Change of Control Put Date.
(f) Purchase
Subject to the requirements (if any) of any stock exchange on which the Notes may be admitted to listing and trading at the relevant time and subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer may at any time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise at any price. Any purchase by tender shall be made available to all Noteholders alike. The Notes so purchased, while held by or on behalf of the Issuer or such Subsidiary, shall not entitle the holder to vote at any meetings of the Noteholders and shall not be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of calculating quorums at meetings of the Noteholders or for the purposes of Conditions 13(a) and 14.
55

(g) Cancellation
All Notes which are redeemed or in respect of which Conversion Rights are exercised will be cancelled and may not be reissued or resold. Subject to the requirements (if any) of any stock exchange on which the Notes may be admitted to listing and trading at the relevant time and subject to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, Notes purchased by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may be re-sold by the Issuer at the Issuer's discretion.
(h) Multiple Notices
If more than one notice of redemption is given pursuant to this Condition 7, the first of such notices to be given shall prevail.

(e) Payments subject to fiscal laws All payments in respect of the Notes are subject in all cases to any applicable fiscal or other laws and regulations. No commissions or expenses shall be charged to the Noteholders in respect of such payments.
(f) Delay in payment Noteholders will not be entitled to any interest or other payment for any delay after the due date in receiving the amount due (i) as a result of the due date not being a business day, or (ii) if a cheque mailed in accordance with this Condition arrives after the date for payment.
(g) Business Days In this Condition, "business day" means a day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which banks and foreign exchange markets are open for business, in New York City and in the place of the specified office of the Registrar.
(h) Paying and Conversion Agent, Registrar, etc. The initial Paying and Conversion Agent and Registrar and their initial specified offices are listed below. The Issuer reserves the right under the Agency Agreement at any time, with the prior written approval of the Trustee, to vary or terminate the appointment of the Paying and Conversion Agent or the Registrar and appoint an additional Paying and Conversion Agent or other Paying, Transfer and Conversion Agents, provided that it will (i) maintain a Paying and Conversion Agent or another Registrar, (ii) maintain a Paying and Conversion Agent with a specified office in a jurisdiction that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other European Union Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN council meeting of 26-27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive and (iii) maintain a Registrar with a specified office outside the United Kingdom. Notice of any change in the Paying and Conversion Agents or the Registrar or their specified offices will promptly be given by the Issuer to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16.

9 Taxation
All payments made by on or behalf the Issuer in respect of the Notes will be made free from any restriction or condition and be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Kingdom of Norway or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, unless deduction or withholding of such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges is compelled by law.
In the event that any such withholding or deduction is required to be made, the Issuer will pay such additional amounts as will result in the receipt by the Noteholders of the amounts which would otherwise have been receivable had no such withholding or deduction been required, except that no such additional amount shall be payable in respect of interest on any Note:
(a) to a holder (or to a third party on behalf of a holder) who is subject to such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges in respect of such Note by reason of his having some connection with the Kingdom of Norway other than merely by holding the Note or by receipt of amounts in respect of the Note or where the withholding or deduction could be avoided by the holder making a declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for exemption to the appropriate authority which such holder is legally capable and competent of making but fails to do so; or
(b) where such withholding or deduction is imposed on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26-27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive.
References in these Conditions to principal and interest shall be deemed also to refer to any additional amounts which may be payable under this Condition or any undertaking or covenant given in addition thereto or in substitution therefor pursuant to the Trust Deed.

11 Undertakings

Whilst any Conversion Right remains exercisable, the Issuer will, save with the approval of an Extraordinary Resolution or with the prior written approval of the Trustee where, in its opinion, it is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders to give such approval:

(a) not issue or pay up any Securities, in either case by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves, other than:

(i)

by the issue of fully paid Ordinary Shares to Shareholders and other

holders of shares in the capital of the Issuer which by their terms entitle the

holders thereof to receive Ordinary Shares; or

(ii) by the issue of Ordinary Shares paid up in full (in accordance with applicable law) and issued wholly, ignoring fractional entitlements, in lieu of the whole or part of a cash dividend; or

(iii) by the issue of fully paid equity share capital (other than Ordinary Shares) to the holders of equity share capital of the same class and other holders of shares in the capital of the Issuer which by their terms entitle the holders thereof to receive equity share capital (other than Ordinary Shares); or

(iv) by the issue of Ordinary Shares or any equity share capital to, or for the benefit of, any employee or former employee, director or executive holding or formerly holding executive office of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any associated company or to trustees or nominees to be

60

held for the benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to an employee, director or executive share or option scheme whether for all employees, directors, or executives or any one or more of them,

unless, in any such case, the same constitutes a Dividend or otherwise gives rise (or would, but for the provisions of Condition 6(f) relating to the carry forward of adjustments, give rise) to an adjustment to the Conversion Price;

(b) not modify the rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares with respect to voting, dividends or liquidation nor issue any other class of equity share capital carrying any rights which are more favourable than the rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares but nothing in this Condition 11(b) shall prevent:

(i)

any consolidation, reclassification or subdivision of the Ordinary Shares;

or

(ii) any modification of such rights which is not, in the opinion of an Independent Financial Adviser (acting as an expert) selected by the Issuer, approved in writing by the Trustee, materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the Notes; or

(iii) any issue of equity share capital where the issue of such equity share capital results, or would, but for the provisions of Condition 6(f) relating to the carry forward of adjustments or the fact that the consideration per Ordinary Share receivable therefore is at least 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share, otherwise result, in an adjustment to the Conversion Price; or

(iv) any issue of equity share capital or modification of rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares, where prior thereto the Issuer shall have instructed an Independent Financial Adviser to determine what (if any) adjustments should be made to the Conversion Price as being fair and reasonable to take account thereof and such Independent Financial Adviser shall have determined in good faith either that no adjustment is required or that an adjustment resulting in an increase in the Conversion Price is required and, if so, the new Conversion Price as a result thereof and the basis upon which such adjustment is to be made and, in any such case, the date on which the adjustment shall take effect (and so that the adjustment shall be made and shall take effect accordingly);

(c) procure that no Securities (whether issued by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer or procured by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer to be issued or issued by any other person pursuant to any arrangement with the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer) issued without rights to convert into, or exchange or subscribe for, Ordinary Shares shall subsequently be granted such rights exercisable at a consideration per Ordinary Share which is less than 95 per cent. of the Current

61

Market Price per Ordinary Share at the close of business on the last dealing day preceding the date of the first public announcement of the proposed inclusion of such rights unless the same gives rise (or would, but for the provisions of Condition 6(f) relating to the carry forward of adjustments, give rise) to an adjustment to the Conversion Price and that at no time shall there be in issue Ordinary Shares of differing nominal values, save where such Ordinary Shares have the same economic rights;

(d) not make any issue, grant or distribution or any other action taken if the effect thereof would be that, on the exercise of Conversion Rights, Ordinary Shares could not, under any applicable law then in effect, be legally issued as fully paid;

(e) not reduce its issued share capital, or any uncalled liability in respect thereof, or any non-distributable reserves, except:

(i)

pursuant to the terms of issue of the relevant share capital; or

(ii) by means of a purchase or redemption of share capital of the Issuer tothe extent permitted by applicable law; or

(iii) by way of transfer to reserves as permitted under applicable law; or

(iv) where the reduction is permitted by applicable law and the Trustee is advised by an Independent Financial Adviser, acting as expert, that the interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced by such reduction; or

(v) where the reduction is permitted by applicable law and results in (or would, but for the provisions of Condition 6(f) relating to the carry forward of adjustments, result in) an adjustment to the Conversion Price,

provided that, without prejudice to the other provisions of these Conditions, the Issuer may exercise such rights as it may from time to time enjoy pursuant to applicable law to purchase its Ordinary Shares and any depositary or other receipts or certificates representing Ordinary Shares without the consent of Noteholders;

62

holders of any Ordinary Shares issued during the period of the offer or scheme arising out of the exercise of the Conversion Rights by the Noteholders;
(g) use its reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Ordinary Shares issued upon exercise of Conversion Rights will, as soon as is practicable, be admitted to listing and to trading on the Relevant Stock Exchange and will be listed, quoted or dealt in, as soon as is practicable, on any other stock exchange or securities market on which the Ordinary Shares may then be listed or quoted or dealt in;
(h) procure that it shall not become domiciled or resident in or subject generally to the taxing authority of any jurisdiction (other than the Kingdom of Norway) unless it would not thereafter be required pursuant to then current laws and regulations to withhold or deduct for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of such jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or therein having power to tax in respect of any payment on or in respect of the Notes;
(i) in the event of a Newco Scheme, the Issuer shall take (or shall procure that there is taken) all necessary action to ensure that (to the satisfaction of the Trustee) immediately upon completion of the scheme of arrangement, at its option, either (a) Newco is substituted under the Notes and the Trust Deed as principal debtor in place of the Issuer (with the Issuer providing an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee) subject to and as provided in the Trust Deed or (b) Newco becomes a guarantor under the Notes and the Trust Deed and, in either case, that such other adjustments are made to these Conditions and the Trust Deed to ensure that the Notes may be converted into or exchanged for ordinary shares of Newco mutatis mutandis in accordance with and subject to these Conditions and the Trust Deed; and

67

(b) Jurisdiction

The Issuer has in the Trust Deed irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts and has waived any objection to Proceedings in such courts whether on the ground of venue or on the ground that the Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum. This submission is made for the benefit of the Trustee and each of the Noteholders and shall not limit the right of any of them to take Proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking of Proceedings in one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not).
(c) A g en t fo r Service o f Process
The Issuer has irrevocably appointed Petroleum Geo-Services (UK) Limited at its registered office for the time being, currently at PGS Court, Halfway Green, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, KT12 1RS, United Kingdom as its agent in England to receive service of process in any Proceedings in England. Nothing herein or in the Trust Deed shall affect the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

THE COMPANY AND THE GROUP

The name of the issuer of the Notes is Petroleum Geo-Services ASA. The Company also trades under the name "PGS". The organisation number of the Company is 916 235 291, and the registered address is Strandveien 4, 1366 Lysaker, Norway. The telephone number is +47 67 52 64 00.

The Company was incorporated on 9 June 1962, but started trading under its current name in 1991 after a merger between Geoteam AS and Nopec AS. The Company is a public limited company incorporated and existing under the laws of the Kingdom of Norway. The Company is subject to the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act.

There have not been any recent developments occurring which, in the opinion of the Company, are substantial for the assessment of the Company's solvency.

The Group consists of the Company and over 80 subsidiaries. A Group corporate chart is attached hereto as Appendix 2. The Company is the holding company for its directly held subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are incorporated in a variety of jurisdictions, including but not limited to, the United States, the United Kingdom, Venezuela, Brazil, Malaysia, Isle of Man and Norway. The Company is the corporate, financial and administrative head entity within

68

the Group, and does not carry out any business activities except for exercising its ownership over its subsidiaries. The Company is also the main borrower of the Group and does from time to time issue parent guarantees in respect of some of its subsidiaries. The Company's offices are at Lysaker, Norway, where the Company's executive employees are situated.
The independent auditor of the Company for the financial years ending 31 December 2005 and 2006 has been Ernst & Young AS, registered address Oslo Atrium, P.O. Box 20 0051 Oslo Norway. Ernst & Young AS is a member of the Norwegian Institute of Public Accountants (d e n N o r s k e R e v is o r fo r e n in g ).
There has been no material adverse change in the Company's prospects since 31 December 2006.
The Company is not aware of any material contracts that are not entered into by the Company in the ordinary course of its business, which could result in any member of the Group being under an obligation or entitlement that is material to the Company's ability to meet its obligation to Noteholders in respect of the Notes.

Other than the fact that the subsidiaries to a larger or lesser extent perform the services offered by the Group, and that the subsidiaries provide the Company with dividend payments and are participating in securing existing debt arrangements, the Company, as the ultimate parent company of the Group, is not dependent on any of the subsidiaries. Consequently, the cash flow from the subsidiaries' operations is necessary for the Company in order to pay the Notes and other financial and monetary obligations.

THE BUSINESS OF THE GROUP

8.1 Introduction

The Group is one of the major global participants in the acquisition of marine three dimensional (3D) seismic data. The Group acquires, processes, interpret, markets and sells seismic data worldwide that is used by oil and natural gas companies to help them find oil and natural gas and to determine the size and structure of known oil and natural gas reservoirs. In the seismic projects, the Group is involved in planning the seismic surveys and acquiring and processing the seismic data. Oil and natural gas companies use this information in evaluating whether to acquire new leases or licenses in areas with potential accumulations of oil and natural gas, in selecting drilling locations, in modeling oil and natural gas reservoir areas and in managing producing reservoirs. The Group uses the Group's High Density 3D - HD3D® technology to acquire 3D data with higher trace densities, giving improved resolution of the subsurface and higher quality images of the reservoirs.

Oil and natural gas companies use 4D or time lapse surveys, which are surveys produced by the repetition of identical 3D surveys over time, to assist in their evaluation of subsurface geophysical conditions that change over time due to the depletion and production of reservoir fluids. This evaluation provides for more efficient production of the reservoir and the possible

69

extension of the reservoir's useful life. The Group provides this service as well as the acquisition of more conventional two dimensional (2D) seismic data.
The Group acquires seismic data both on an exclusive contract basis for its customers and on its own behalf as multi-client data for licensing from time to time to multiple customers on a non-exclusive basis. In some of the projects, the Group shares interests in the revenue from the sales of the multi-client data with third parties. During 2006, the Group used its active seismic vessel acquisition capacity, measured by time, approximately 83 per cent. to acquire contract data and approximately 17 per cent. to acquire multi-client data. This compares to approximately 91 per cent. and 9 per cent., respectively, for 2005 and 88 per cent. and 12 per cent., respectively, for 2004.
The Group manages its business in two segments as follows:
· Marine, which consists of streamer seismic data acquisition and marine multi-client library. The marine segment has a global scope, and includes the Group's data processing, technology development, research and development and reservoir-related consulting activities; and
· Onshore, which consists of all seismic operations on land and in very shallow water and transition zones, and including our onshore multi-client library. The onshore segment is regional in scope, namely focusing on North America, South America and Africa.
In the Group's financials, data processing and technology is reported as part of the marine segment. The marine segment (including data processing and technology) accounts for approximately 80 per cent. of the Group's total turnover, and is managed from Lysaker, Norway. The onshore segment accounts for approximately 20 per cent. of the Group's total turnover and is managed from Houston, Texas.
8.2 Contract and Multi-Client Operations
8.2.1 Contract Operations
When the Group acquires seismic data on a contract basis, the customers direct the scope and extent of the survey and retain ownership of the data obtained. Contracts for seismic data acquisition, which are generally awarded on a competitive bid basis, may include both a dayrate and a production rate element.
Under these contracts, the customer assumes primary responsibility for interruption of acquisition operations due to factors that are beyond the Group's control, including weather and permitting. Contracts are also awarded on a turnkey basis. With turnkey contracts, the customers pay based upon the number of seismic lines or square kilometres of seismic data collected.

The Group performed contract operations during 2006 in the North Sea; offshore Brazil; offshore West and South Africa; in the Mediterranean; offshore Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and other countries in the Asia Pacific region; offshore Russia; offshore Qatar; onshore in the continental U.S. as well as Alaska, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Libya and Bangladesh; and in shallow water offshore Nigeria.
8.2.2 M u lti-C lien t O perations
From the perspective of an oil and natural gas company, licensing multi-client seismic data on a non-exclusive basis is typically less expensive on a per unit basis than acquiring the seismic data on an exclusive basis. From the Group's perspective, multi-client seismic data can be more cost effective to acquire and may be sold a number of times to different customers over a period of years. As a result, multi-client seismic data has the potential to be more profitable than contract data. However, when the Group acquires multi-client seismic data the Group assumes the risk that future sales may not cover the cost of acquiring and processing such seismic data. Obtaining pre-funding for a portion of these costs reduces this risk, and typically the Group requires a relatively high level of pre-funding before beginning a project. The Group determines the level of pre-funding that is required before initiating a multi-client seismic survey by evaluating various factors affecting the sales potential of each survey. These factors include:
· the existence, quality and age of any seismic data that may already exist in the area;
· the amount of leased acreage in the area;
· whether or when an award of a license to explore and develop an area for production to be covered by a survey is expected to be granted;
· the prospectivity of the area in question for hydrocarbons and for future licenses of multi-client data;
· the existing infrastructure in the region to transport oil and natural gas to market;
· the historical turnover of the leased acreage;
· the political and economic stability of the countries where the data are to be acquired; and
· the level of interest from oil and natural gas companies in the area.
The Group owns a significant library of marine multi-client data in most of the major oil and natural gas basins of the world, including the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, offshore West Africa, offshore Brazil and the Asia Pacific region. The Group's onshore library is entirely in North America. After substantial reductions in its multi-client investments in 2003 and 2004,

After the acquisition of Arrow, the sale of Ramform Victory and the delivery of the newbuild Ramform Sovereign, the Group currently owns 15 marine streamer vessels, including 6 vessels of the unique Ramform class, which are all in operations. In addition, PGS has ordered one Ramform new-build vessel scheduled for delivery in Q2 2009, respectively. In 2007 the Group reached an agreement with the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry ("METI") for a long term cooperation agreement, which includes the sale and flag change of the 3D seismic vessel Ramform Victory and the continued provision by PGS of intellectual property and technical and operational services. The vessel was delivered in Q1 2008 (please see a more detailed description under Section 8.5). Further, Arrow has ordered four high capacity seismic new build vessels for delivery in 2008 and 2009 (of which two are contracted). Arrow has also purchased two vessels planned for conversion.

(1) The Group has UK lease arrangements for each of the Ramform Valiant and the Ramform Challenger. Under the leases, the Group leases the vessels under long-term charters that give the Group the option to purchase the vessels for a de minimis amount at the end of the charter periods. The leases are legally defeased because the Group has made payments to banks in consideration for which the banks have assumed liability to the lessors equal to basic rentals and termination sum obligations.
(2) The charter agreement for the Orient Explorer has a one-year term and will be extended annually for each year until 2011, unless the Group terminates the charter by giving three months' notice.

The seismic vessels have an equipment complement consisting of the following: · recording instrumentation; · digital recording streamers; · acoustic positioning systems for source and streamer locations;

74

multiple navigation systems for vessel positioning; and
· a source control system that controls the synchronisation of the energy sources and an air gun array firing system that activates the acoustic energy source.
Prior to the Acquisition of Arrow, the vessels had a normal utilisation of approximately 85 per cent., the remaining 15 per cent. is divided between yard time and steaming.

(1) The Group has Spanish tax lease arrangements for each of the Newbuildings 532 - 535. Under the leases, the Group leases the vessels under bare-boat charters that give the Group the option to purchase the vessels for a de minimis amount at the end of the charter periods.
(2) The Polar Explorer has been renamed Southern Explorer.
(3) Delivery dates for Newbuildings 532 and 533 have been delayed, but this does not have significant economic effect to PGS as the vessels are chartered to Western Geco.
8.3.4 D a ta p ro cessin g a n d technology
The Group's data processing business forms a part of its marine segment and provides seismic data processing services
· which are used to develop multi-client data that is added to the Group's own multi client data library;
· which are used to reprocess and enhance older multi-client data to increase the potential for additional late sales; and
· to clients for their own use.

competitors by its quality and safety performance of its operations. In addition the Group has a reputation for implementing proactive social action programs enabling sustainable development and successful operations in community sensitive areas. The Group believes that it can remain competitive by capitalising on its project execution and management skills and by continuing to provide a high-quality technical product. The majority of the Group's recording equipment pool is relatively uniform, facilitating changing crew counts and channel counts on any specific crew as the market dictates.
8.5 Major transactions during 2007
During 2007, the Company acquired MTEM, Ltd, a provider of electromagnetic ("EM") services used to detect the presence of hydrocarbons, for a price of U.S.$ 275 million on a debt free basis. MTEM is a company with patent protected technology and MTEM currently has several supplementary patent applications pending. The technology is complementary to PGS' own development of towed EM, the technologies together positioning PGS to address the emerging EM market. The EM technology can be utilised both within the marine and the onshore business segments.
Further, during 2007, PGS acquired Applied Geophysical Services, Inc. ("AGS") for a price of U.S.$ 51 million, subject to certain adjustments for changes in working capital. PGS estimates an enterprise value for AGS of approximately USD 46 million. AGS is based in Houston, Texas, USA and specialises in providing advanced depth imaging services to the oil and gas industry, currently focusing primarily on the depth market in the Gulf of Mexico, using a proprietary 3D beam migration technology. AGS has more than a 20 year track record in the Gulf of Mexico.
In 2007, PGS also purchased Roxicon Geogrids AS based in Stavanger Norway for U.S.$ 12 million. Roxicon is specialising in multi-client seismic data merging for the North Sea based on released data sets for the Norwegian Continental Shelf.
In November 2007, PGS acquired approximately 91 per cent. of the shares in Arrow at a price of NOK 96 per share. By a mandatory offer and offer to and notification of compulsory acquisition document dated 3 December 2007, PGS acquired the remaining outstanding shares in Arrow pursuant to the provisions of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act of 1997 and the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act. At the date of this Prospectus, PGS is the owner of all the issued and outstanding shares in Arrow.
In 2007, PGS has also announced that it has reached an agreement with METI for a long term cooperation agreement, which includes the sale and flag change of the 3D seismic vessel Ramform Victory and the continued provision by PGS of intellectual property and technical and operational services. The vessel will be used by METI in a planned 10 years seismic campaign to survey approximately 70,000 square kilometres of the Japanese Continental Shelf. As part of the transaction, a service agreement has been entered into between PGS and METI for technical and operational support providing PGS with an exclusive right to provide such services relating to Ramform Victory during the survey period. The commercial terms of the agreement are fixed for four years. METI took delivery of Ramform Victory in January
77

2008. Under the agreements, aggregate amounts of U.S.$ 225 million (approximately 91 per cent. of which is denominated in JPY) became payable to PGS upon reaching defined milestones and delivery of the vessel, with approximately 60 per cent. being paid in 2007 and 45 per cent. being paid in Q1 2008. It is the intention of PGS to purchase the vessel at the end of the survey period. Further, the Company has also been invited to deliver additional services relating to Ramform Victory after the sale to METI, including the maritime operation of the vessel
8.6 Recent developments
On 19 December 2007, the Company announced in a press release that compared to the guidance given in the Company's interim financial report for the third quarter 2007, the expected fourth quarter 2007 productive time and related revenues and margins in the marine contract segment have been reduced. This is primarily due to longer than scheduled yardstays and steaming for two Ramform vessels and a delay in obtaining operational permits for one Ramform vessel.

10.3 Employee share option scheme

Under the amended plan, the mentioned executives who were employed by the Company during 2006 and remained employed as of December 2006 were entitled to a maximum cash bonus of up to 50 per cent. (or in the case of the CEO 60 per cent.) of annual base salary and a maximum share purchase bonus of up to 25 per cent. (or in the case of the CEO 30 per cent.) of annual base salary. Within these limits, bonuses were determined on the basis of achievement of financial and nonfinancial performance targets. Any amounts received as a share purchase bonus, on a net basis (after withholding tax), were required to be used to buy PGS shares at market prices and held for a minimum of three years.

86

12 TAXATION
12.1 Norwegian taxation related to Notes
12.1.1 Introduction
The following is a summary of certain Norwegian tax considerations relevant to the acquisition of Notes, ownership and disposal of Notes and conversion of such Notes into shares in the Company by holders that are residents of Norway for purposes of Norwegian taxation.
Investors who are not residents of Norway for tax purposes are as a main rule not subject to Norwegian income tax or Norwegian net wealth tax in connection with acquisition, holding or disposal of Notes, unless their investment is linked to a Norwegian permanent establishment or any business conducted in Norway. Residents of other jurisdictions than Norway should consult with and rely upon local tax advisors as regards tax position in their country of residence.
The summary is based on applicable Norwegian laws, rules and regulations as they exist as of the date of this Prospectus. Such laws, rules and regulations are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to the holders and does not address foreign tax laws. Each holder should consult his or her own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences for him or her and the applicability and effect of any Norwegian or foreign tax laws and possible changes in such laws.

88

12.1.2 T axation o f interest
Interest on Notes is taxable income for both individual Noteholders and corporate Noteholders at a flat rate of 28 per cent. Interest on Notes is taxed on accrual basis, i.e. regardless of when the return is actually paid.
12.1.3 Taxation upon disposal, redem ption o r conversion o f N otes
The Ministry of Finance has in a statement dated 6 December 2005 assumed that convertible notes are not comprised by the tax exemption method for corporate shareholders. The description below presumes that this statement is correct.
Redemption at the end of term as well as prior disposal is treated as realisation of Notes and will trigger a capital gain or loss. A conversion of Notes into shares will constitute a taxable event and be treated as if the Notes had been sold in exchange of shares. Capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income at a flat rate of 28 per cent. Losses will be deductible in the Noteholder's ordinary income. Any capital gain or loss is computed as the difference between the amount received by the Noteholder on realisation (the market value of the shares received in case of conversion) and the cost price of the Note. The cost price is equal to the price for which the Noteholder acquired the Notes.
Costs incurred in connection with the purchase and realisation of Notes may be deducted from the Noteholder's taxable ordinary income in the year of realisation of the Notes.
12.1.4 W ithholding Tax
There is no Norwegian withholding tax for non-resident Noteholders for Notes issued by Norwegian issuers with respect to payment of interests to Noteholders.
12.1.5 N e t W ealth Taxation
The value of Notes at the end of each income year will be included in the computation of the Noteholder's taxable net wealth for municipal and state net wealth tax purposes. Listed notes are valued at their quoted value on 1 January in the year of assessment. The current marginal wealth tax rate is 1.1 per cent. Resident limited liability companies and certain similar entities are exempt from Norwegian net wealth taxation.
12.1.6 Inheritance Tax
The transfer of Notes by inheritance or gift may give raise to a liability to pay inheritance or gift tax to Norway if the deceased, at the time of death, or the donor, at the time of the gift, is a resident or citizen of Norway. However, in the case of inheritance tax, if the deceased was a citizen but not a resident of Norway, Norwegian inheritance tax will not be levied if inheritance tax or a similar tax is levied in the country where the deceased was resident. Irrespective of residence or citizenship, Norwegian inheritance tax may be levied if the Notes are held in connection with the conduct of a trade or business in Norway.
89

The basis for the tax calculation is the nominal value of the Notes at the time the transfer takes place, unless the assumed sales price is lower.
12.1.7 T ransfer Taxes
There is currently no Norwegian stamp duty or other transfer taxes, including VAT, on the transfer or issuance of Notes.
12.2 Norwegian Taxation related to the Company's shares
12.2.1 Introduction
The following is a summary of certain Norwegian tax considerations relevant to the acquisition, ownership and disposal of shares by holders that are residents of Norway for purposes of Norwegian taxation ("resident shareholders") and holders that are not residents of Norway for such purposes ("non-resident shareholders").
The summary is based on applicable Norwegian laws, rules and regulations as they exist as of the date of this Prospectus. Such laws, rules and regulations are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to the shareholders and does not address foreign tax laws.
Each shareholder should consult his or her own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences for him or her and the applicability and effect of any Norwegian or foreign tax laws and possible changes in such laws.
12.2.2 T axation o f D ividends
Resident Corporate Shareholders
Dividends distributed from the Company to resident corporate shareholders (i.e. limited liability companies and similar entities) are currently exempt from taxation.
Resident Individual Shareholders
Dividends distributed from the Company to individual shareholders exceeding a calculated tax free allowance, will be taxed as ordinary income for the shareholder at a flat rate of 28 per cent. The tax-free allowance is calculated as the acquisition cost of the share multiplied by a determined (risk-free) interest rate after tax. The tax-free allowance will be calculated on each individual share, not on a portfolio basis. Unused allowance may be carried forward and set off against future dividends or against gains upon realisation of the same share.
The tax free allowance is allocated to the individual shareholders holding shares at the end of each calendar year. Individual shareholders who transfer shares will not be entitled to deduct any calculated allowance related to the year of transfer.
90

Non-resident Shareholders
Dividends distributed to non-resident shareholders are in general subject to a Norwegian withholding tax of 25 per cent., unless otherwise provided for in an applicable tax treaty (or exemptions for EEA shareholders apply, see below). Norway has entered into tax treaties with more than 70 countries. In most tax treaties the withholding tax rate is reduced to 15 per cent.
Non-resident shareholders, who have been subject to a higher withholding tax than applicable in the relevant tax treaty, may apply to the Norwegian tax authorities for a refund of the excess taxes (withheld). The application is to be filed with the Central Office - Foreign Tax Affairs.
Dividends paid to a non-resident shareholder in respect of nominee registered shares are not eligible for reduced treaty-rate withholding at the time of payment, unless the nominee, by agreeing to provide certain information regarding beneficial owners, has obtained approval for reduced treaty-rate withholding from the Central Office - Foreign Tax Affairs. To obtain such approval the nominee is required to file a summary to the tax authorities including all beneficial owners that are subject to withholding tax at a reduced rate.
Withholding tax on dividends distributed to corporate shareholders resident in the EEA has been abolished.
When distributing dividends to individual shareholders resident in EEA, the Company will deduct withholding tax according to the relevant tax treaty. If the withholding tax withheld by the Company exceeds the tax that would have been imposed according to the calculations applicable to resident individual shareholders, the individual shareholder resident in the EEA may apply for a refund of the excess tax. When calculating such tax the general withholding tax rate of 25 per cent. is applicable, and not the general tax rate of 28 per cent. applicable to resident personal shareholders. In effect this gives the personal shareholder resident in the EEA the choice between using the withholding tax rate determined in the tax treaty or, if more beneficial, the tax rate that would have applied had the foreign shareholder been a resident of Norway for tax purposes.
If a non-resident shareholder is engaged in business activities in Norway and the shares with respect to which the dividend is paid are effectively connected with such activities, the dividend will be taxed in the same manner as dividend paid to a resident shareholder, see description of taxation of resident shareholders.
In the budget proposal for 2008, the Norwegian Government has proposed to narrow the exemption from withholding tax for corporate shareholders resident within the EEA. According to the proposal, only corporate shareholders which are genuinely established and carry out genuine economic activity within the EEA will benefit from the exemption. The proposal will be decided upon by the Parliament later in 2007.

For resident corporate shareholders, gains from sale or other disposal of shares in the Company are currently exempt from taxation, and losses suffered from such realisation are not tax deductible. Costs incurred in connection with the purchase and sale of shares are not deductible.
Resident Individual Shareholders
For resident individual shareholders gains from sale or other disposal of shares are taxable as ordinary income at a rate of 28 per cent. and losses are deductible against ordinary income.
Gain or loss is calculated per share, as the difference is the sales price minus the acquisition cost of the share. A taxable gain on a share may be reduced by unused calculated allowance connected to the same share, but may not lead to or increase a deductible loss. Further, unused allowance may not be set off against gains from realisation of other shares.
The tax free allowance is allocated to the individual shareholders holding shares at the end of each calendar year. Individual shareholders who transfer shares will not be entitled to deduct any calculated allowance related to the year of transfer.
If a shareholder disposes of shares acquired at different times, the shares that were first acquired will be deemed as first sold (the FIFO-principle) upon calculating taxable gain or loss.
Costs incurred in connection with the purchase and sale of shares may be deducted in the year of sale.
A resident individual shareholder who moves abroad and ceases to be a tax resident of Norway or is regarded as tax resident of another jurisdiction according to an applicable tax treaty, will be deemed taxable in Norway for any potential gain related to the shares held at the time the tax residency ceased or the time when the shareholder was regarded as tax resident of another jurisdiction according to an applicable tax treaty, as if the shares were realised at this time (exit taxation). Currently, gains of NOK 500,000 or less are not taxable. If the shareholder moves to a jurisdiction within the EEA, potential losses related to shares held at the time tax residency ceases will be tax deductible. Taxation (loss deduction) will occur at the time the shares are actually sold or otherwise disposed of. The tax liability calculated according to these provisions will not apply i.a. if the shares are not realised within five years after the shareholder ceased to be resident in Norway for tax purposes or was regarded as tax resident in another jurisdiction according to an applicable tax treaty.
92

Non-resident shareholders
Gains from sale or other disposal of shares by a non-resident shareholder will not be subject to taxation in Norway unless the non-resident shareholder is an individual and (i) holds the shares effectively connected with business activities carried on in or managed from Norway, or (ii) has been a resident of Norway for tax purposes within the five calendar years preceding the sale or disposal, and the gains are not exempt pursuant to the provisions of a tax treaty. If the latter rule applies, the latent gain on the shares at the time the individual ceased to be a resident in Norway for tax purposes will be taxable in Norway.
12.2.4 N e t W ealth Tax
Resident corporate shareholders and certain similar entities are exempt from Norwegian net wealth tax. For other resident shareholders, shares will form part of their basis for calculation of Norwegian net wealth tax. The current marginal net wealth tax rate is 1.1 per cent.
Listed shares are valued at 85 per cent. of their quoted value as of 1 January in the assessment year. The Norwegian Ministry of Finance has however in Ot. prp. no. 1 (2007-2008) proposed that listed shares shall be valued at 100 per cent. of their quoted value as of 1 January in the assessment year, with effect from the fiscal year 2008.
A non-resident shareholder is not subject to Norwegian net wealth tax with respect to the shares, unless his shareholding is effectively connected with a business carried out by the shareholder in Norway.
12.2.5 Inheritance Tax
When shares are transferred either through inheritance or as a gift, such transfer may give rise to inheritance or gift tax in Norway if the deceased, at the time of death, or the donor, at the time of the gift, is a resident or citizen of Norway. However, in the case of inheritance tax, if the deceased was a citizen but not a resident of Norway, Norwegian inheritance tax will not be levied if inheritance tax, or a similar tax, is levied by the deceased's country of residence. Irrespective of residence or citizenship, Norwegian inheritance tax may be levied if the shares are effectively connected with certain business activities carried out by the shareholder in Norway.
12.2.6 Transfer Taxes
There is currently no Norwegian stamp duty or other transfer taxes, including VAT, on the transfer or issuance of shares.
13 SALE OF THE NOTES
The Joint Lead Managers have entered into a subscription agreement dated 3 December 2007 with the Issuer (the "Subscription Agreement").
93

The foregoing sentence shall not apply to the issue of the Notes or the issue of Ordinary Shares issued upon conversion of the Notes, and shall not apply to the grant of options or issuance of Ordinary Shares under any employee share option scheme of the Company in existence on or before the date of the Subscription Agreement.

14 OTHER INFORMATION
14.1 Legal disputes
The Group operates internationally facing complex environments and jurisdictions and is involved in several legal disputes connected to its operations around the world and/or its employment base including former employees. However, during the last 12 months no new legal disputes (including legal proceedings, actual or threatened) have been identified, which may have or have had in the recent past, significant effects on the Company's or the Group's financial position or profitability.
In the Company's annual report for 2006 the Company has disclosed certain contingencies in the tax area, which could potentially be significant, as follows:
Singapore - Tax Deduction for Multi-Client Amortization
The Company previously received a tax claim from the tax authority in Singapore, which was based on the assertion that tax deductions for expenses related to investments in the multi client data library would not be allowed. The Company filed tax returns claiming tax deductions for amortization of the multi-client library. Based on the facts and the uncertainty associated with the application of the tax law, the Company determined that it was probable that the deduction would be disallowed. Accordingly, additional tax liability was accrued based on a total disallowance of the deduction. In late February 2007, the tax authorities in Singapore decided to allow such deductions. This is considered to be a non-adjusting event occurring after the balance sheet date, which will lead to a reversal in the first quarter of 2007.
95

The actual effect to the tax expense in the first quarter of 2007 will be a benefit of U.S.$ 8.5 million.
Norway - Exit Shipping Regime
Until 1 January 2002, a foreign subsidiary was included in the Norwegian shipping tax regime. No deferred taxes were recognised on unremitted earnings in this subsidiary prior to the withdrawal from the regime as these earnings at that time were expected to be reinvested indefinitely within the regime. Subsequently in 2003 it was decided to exit with effect from 2002. The Norwegian Central Tax Office ("CTO") has not yet finalised the 2002 tax assessment in relation to withdrawal from the Norwegian shipping tax regime. The pending issue is related to the assessment of the fair value of the vessels involved. The Company based such exit values on third party valuations, while the CTO has raised the issue whether the Company's book values at 31 December 2001, would be more appropriate as basis for computing the tax effects of the exit. Any increase of exit values will result in an increase of taxable exit gain and a corresponding increase in basis for future tax depreciation. The Company does not have sufficient information to calculate the possible additional exposure if the CTO position is upheld. However it is considered reasonably possible that a liability exists. Based on events and new information received during the first quarter of 2007 the Company has evaluated that it is more likely than not that there will not be an outflow of resources related to this contingent tax liability, hence the tax accrual as of 31 December 2006 is reversed in the first quarter of 2007.
Brazil - Service Tax Claim
The Company has an ongoing dispute in Brazil related to municipal services tax ("ISS") for late sales of multi-client data. The issue is whether the Company is actually liable for ISS tax on such sales and, if it is liable for such taxes, to which municipality such taxes should be paid (municipalities levy ISS tax at different rates). The maximum theoretical exposure including all years at December 31, 2007 amounts to $ 44 million of ISS tax. In addition interest charges and penalties could run up to a maximum of $ 54 million. ISS is a service tax, and the Company's primary view is that licensing of multi-client data held by PGS should be treated as rental of an asset rather than performance of a service, and therefore not subject to ISS. The Company intends to vigorously defend its view. The Company has not made any accrual for this contingency.
These are still in various phases of administrative proceedings. During 2007 there have been various developments in all of these contingencies, eliminating the Companies exposure in Singapore, reducing the likelihood of taxes becoming payable related to the CTO issue and increasing the Companies estimate of maximum exposure in the ISS issue in Brazil. However, at the same time the Company believes that the likelihood that the Companies position in the ISS issue will prevail has increased. The Company believes that in total its positions on the disclosed tax contingencies at the date of this Prospectus are not materially worse that disclosed in its annual report for 2006.
