The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered with, recommended by, or approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or any other federal, state or foreign securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has any such commission or regulatory authority reviewed or passed upon the accuracy of this offering memorandum.

Presentation of financial and other data
Presentation of financial information
Unless otherwise indicated, the financial information included in this offering memorandum relates to the Parent Company and not to the Issuer.
The Issuer and certain Guarantors are holding companies with no independent business operations or significant assets other than investments in its subsidiaries. The Issuer is a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent Company, and the results of operations and financial condition of the Issuer are included in the Parent Company's consolidated financial statements.
In this offering memorandum, financial information has been derived from the following information of the Parent Company:
 the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, including the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and audited by our independent auditors, Ernst & Young AB, as indicated in their audit reports included elsewhere in this offering memorandum (the "Audited Consolidated Financial Statements");
 the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2014 (that include comparative information for the three months ended March 31, 2013), which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 on the same basis as our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and which have been reviewed by our independent auditors, Ernst &Young AB, as indicated in their review report included elsewhere in this offering memorandum (the "Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements" and together with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements the "Consolidated Financial Statements"); and
 our internal accounting system.
The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Ernst & Young AB's audit reports thereon as well as the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and Ernst & Young AB's review report thereon are included in this offering memorandum beginning on page F-1.
In addition, this offering memorandum includes certain unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014. The unaudited consolidated statement of income information and the other financial and operating information presented in this offering memorandum for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 were derived by subtracting from the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 of the Parent Company the comparative information from unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and adding the information from the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as well as from the Parent Company's internal accounting system. The unaudited consolidated statement of income information and the other financial and operating information as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 has been prepared solely for the purposes of this offering memorandum and is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date and is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting.
In addition, we have included certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios in this offering memorandum. See "--Non IFRS financial measures".
The Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the F-pages to this offering memorandum should be read in conjunction with the notes thereto. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of the Offering of
ix

the Notes and the financial information contained in this offering memorandum. You should consult your own professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and how those differences could affect the financial information contained in this offering memorandum. These standards also require management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements are disclosed in the financial statements. The accounting policies for the Parent Company are set out in the "F-pages" of this offering memorandum.
The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial data contained in this offering memorandum has not been prepared on the basis of IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has been derived by applying pro forma adjustments to our historical Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum and gives effect to the Refinancing and the use of proceeds therefrom as described in "Use of proceeds", as if they had occurred on April 1, 2013 for the pro forma income statement information and on March 31, 2014 for the pro forma balance sheet information. The unaudited consolidated pro forma adjustments and the unaudited pro forma financial data set out in this offering memorandum are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable but may differ materially from the actual amounts. The pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only and does not purport to present what our results would actually have been had these transactions occurred on the dates presented or to project our results of operations or financial position for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.
Financial information marked as "unaudited" in tables in this offering memorandum is not extracted from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and was either extracted from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, the Parent Company's internal accounting system or are calculations based on unaudited amounts from the abovementioned sources.
Certain numerical figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial data presented in millions or thousands and percentages, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set forth in "Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" are calculated using the numerical data in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent Company or the tabular presentation of other data (subject to rounding) contained in this offering memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.
The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC which would apply if this offering memorandum, the Notes and the Guarantees were being registered with the SEC.
Non IFRS financial measures
Throughout this offering memorandum, we present financial measures and adjustments that are not presented in accordance with IFRS or any other internationally accepted accounting principles, including Contribution, Contribution margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA per ton, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Trade working capital, Capital expenditure, expansion capital expenditure, maintenance capital expenditure, Free cash flow, as well as certain leverage and coverage ratios derived from these financial measures.
We have defined each of the following non IFRS financial measures as follows:
 "Adjusted EBITDA" is defined as EBITDA after adding back restructuring costs incurred during the period;
x

 "Adjusted EBITDA margin" is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales;
 "Capital expenditure" is defined as purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets;
 "Contribution" is defined as net sales less (i) changes in inventories and work in progress, (ii) costs of raw materials and supplies, (iii) foreign exchange differences on purchased goods, (iv) energy costs and (v) freight and distribution costs;
 "Contribution margin" is defined as Contribution shown as a percentage of net sales for the same period;
 "EBITDA" is defined as operating profit (loss) for the period before depreciation, amortization and impairments;
 "EBITDA margin" is defined as EBITDA as a percentage of net sales;
 "EBITDA per ton" is defined as EBITDA divided by sales volume (tons of our final product shipped to customers);
 "Free cash flow" is defined as cash flows before financing activities after adding back income tax paid and net cash interest paid;
 "Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA" is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, further adjusted to reflect headcount reductions, certain transportation cost savings and energy cost savings that occurred in the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, and headcount reductions, energy cost savings, electricity cost reductions as a result of new hedging policy and electricity certificate savings due to changes in legal structure at Hofors that are planned for 2014;
 "Pro forma net financial debt" is defined as total third party debt excluding finance lease liabilities, net of cash and cash equivalents of the Group, on a consolidated basis as of March 31, 2014 after giving effect to the Refinancing, including the issuance of the Notes and the use of proceeds thereof as contemplated herein as if it occurred on March 31, 2014;
 "Pro forma interest expense" is defined as interest expense for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing, including the issuance of the Notes and the use of proceeds thereof as contemplated herein, as if it occurred on April 1, 2013 and assuming that the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn and excluding the commitment fees under that facility and imputed interest expense on finance lease liabilities and financial income for such period;
 "Trade working capital" is defined as trade receivables plus inventories less trade payables.
We have presented these financial measures as they are used by our management to monitor our financial results and available operating liquidity. We believe such measures represent similar measures that are often used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties and can be useful indicators of financial position, financial performance and liquidity when read together with IFRS measures. We believe these measures enhance the investor's understanding of indebtedness and our current ability to fund our ongoing operations. You should exercize caution in comparing non-IFRS measures to IFRS measures or to similar non-IFRS measures reported by other companies.
These non-IFRS measures and related ratios presented in this offering memorandum should not be considered in isolation and are not measures of liquidity or performance, are not measures determined based on IFRS or any other internationally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as an alternative to the historical financial results or other indicators of our performance or liquidity based on IFRS. These non-IFRS financial measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as presented by other
xi

companies due to differences in the way our non-IFRS financial measures are calculated. The nonIFRS measures we present may also be defined differently than the corresponding terms under the Indenture (as defined herein) the Revolving Credit Facility and the Original Pension Insurance Line. The non-IFRS financial information contained in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC. Even though the non-IFRS financial measures are used by management to assess our financial position, financial results and liquidity and these types of measures are commonly used by investors, they have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial position or results of operations as reported under IFRS.

Other data
In this offering memorandum we present percentage changes in our order intake. Customers typically purchase products from us on a purchase order basis and may increase, reduce and, in some instances, cancel their orders. Due to the nature of the end market we serve, our customary arrangements also permit customers to delay orders. The changes in our order intake presented in this offering memorandum are therefore subject to any such adjustments.
Certain figures in this offering memorandum have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, amounts shown as totals in tables or elsewhere may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures which precede them. In addition, certain percentages presented in the tables in this offering memorandum reflect calculations based upon the underlying information prior to rounding and, accordingly, may not conform exactly to the percentages that would be derived if the relevant calculations were based upon the rounded numbers.

Conversion measures

We present our production data and certain consumption data using the following measures (abbreviated as follows):

G W h ........................................ kt ............................................. m3 ............................................. MWh ...................................... ton ...........................................

Industry and market data
We operate in a segment of the steel industry focused on mildly and highly alloyed steel, or so called "engineering steel", for which it is difficult to obtain precise industry and market information. In this offering memorandum we rely on and refer to certain economic information, information regarding our industry and information regarding the end markets in which we operate and compete. We have obtained this information from various third party sources, including providers of macroeconomic and industry data. Furthermore for the purpose of this offering memorandum we have commissioned and used a report prepared for us by Metal Strategies Inc. in 2014 (the "Metal Strategies Report"). In addition, certain information was obtained through discussions with our customers and from our own internal estimates.
While we believe that the economic and industry reports and publications we have used are reliable, they including the Metal Strategies Report have not been independently verified and therefore we do not assume responsibility for the accuracy of the information contained in them. To the extent that information was taken from third parties, we assume responsibility for the correct reproduction and extraction of such information. As far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information published or reported to us by these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. However, market studies and analyses are frequently based on information and assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct, and their methodology may be forward-looking and speculative. Additionally, industry and economic publications, reports, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in some instances state that they do not assume liability for such information. We and the Initial Purchasers cannot assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such information as we have not independently verified such information.
In addition, this offering memorandum contains certain information about our industry that is based on our own internal information which has not been externally verified. In certain of the specialty and end markets in which we operate, it is difficult to directly ascertain industry or market data. In certain cases, we have therefore made statements in this offering memorandum regarding our industry, specialty and end markets and our position therein based solely on our experience and management estimates. We cannot assure you that any of the assumptions on which we have based our information and estimates are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry and our end markets, and none of our internal surveys or information has been verified by any independent or external sources. While we assume that our own market observations are reliable, we give no warranty for the accuracy of our own estimates and the information derived from them. They may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from future studies conducted by market research institutes or other independent sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, such data involves risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading ''Risk factors'' in this offering memorandum. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the industry or market data contained in this offering memorandum, including information derived from the Metal Strategies Report.
We do not intend, and do not assume any obligations, to update industry or market data set forth in this offering memorandum, except as required by law. Finally, trends in the market place tend to change. As a result, investors and prospective investors should be aware that data in this offering memorandum and estimates based on that data may be an unreliable indicator of future results.

Overview
We are a leading European producer of engineering steel, with a focus on value add products for demanding engineering applications. We are headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, and have five main production facilities in Sweden and Finland, including three electric arc furnace ("EAF") melting facilities. We have three finishing facilities in France, Italy and the Netherlands and 15 sales offices across Europe and in the United States, Singapore and China.
We supply engineering steel products under our master brand "Ovako" and our five distinct product brands M-Steel, BQ-Steel, IQ-Steel, SZ-Steel and WR-Steel, which are based on leading application development, metallurgical expertise and production technology. We have more than 300 active feasible steel grades for making materials, of which 110 make up more than 80% of the volumes, across our three main production flows. Most of our sales volume can be categorized into our five product brands, which represent five types of engineering steel materials that we sell, each of which has its own specialized end uses. Our production facilities use these steel grades to produce more than 10,000 different hot-rolled or forged shapes for customers, 2,400 of which comprised approximately 80% of our volume in 2013.
We have a diversified client base with over 2,000 customers, many of which consist of long standing relationships with companies who are leaders in their end markets. We believe that one of the key benefits we offer our customers is working together with them to solve their particular engineering challenges. As our products are often specific to our customers' requirements we benefit from being the supplier through our customer's entire product cycle, which may be several years. Consequently we benefit from a high proportion of repeat customers, with approximately 97.5% of the volumes sold to our top 1,000 customers in 2013 purchased by repeat customers that had placed orders with us in 2012. We have had relationships with each of our top ten customers for at least nine years, seven of which we have had for more than 20 years. Our top ten customers represented 40% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. We supply our largest customers at several different assembly facilities across a number of different jurisdictions and end markets.
We operate in the engineering steel segment, a segment of the steel industry focused on mildly to highly alloyed steel. The engineering steel segment is a specialized sector within the broader general steel industry. Value is added to our products by providing them with specific qualities requested by clients. We produce engineering steel products for four main end markets: automotive and transportation, other engineering, mining and oil & gas, and energy production. The automotive and transportation and other engineering markets are our largest end markets, which we estimate accounted for approximately 40% and 30% of our total net sales in 2013, respectively. Our main geographic markets are Western Europe and the Nordics (Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway). In 2013, Western Europe (excluding the Nordics) and the Nordics accounted for 44.5% and 39.3%, respectively, of our total net sales, with Sweden and Germany together accounting for 52.1% of our total net sales.

We have been owned by Triton since 2010, during which time we have successfully managed through the recent market downturn in Europe. During the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, we generated total revenue of EUR875.6 million and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (as defined herein) of EUR74.0 million and sold 709 kt of steel. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we had an average of 3,001 full time equivalent employees worldwide.
Our strengths
Market leadership positions, strong reputation and attractive end markets
We are a European market leader in many of our core products and have market leadership positions in select niche applications. We are the largest, one of the largest, or in, in some cases, the only producer, of key specialized niche engineering steel product forms. For example, we have a leading position in a number of segments, such as bearings, and have the highest portion of bearing steel volume of any European steel producer. We believe that we have built a reputation as a trustworthy, dynamic, customer-focused engineering steel expert through working closely with our customers to develop products. We believe there is a high degree of brand recognition of the "Ovako" brand which facilitates our sales and marketing efforts and provides a strong platform for new product and application launches. We believe our good reputation is shown by the long relationships we have maintained with certain key customers and the many repeat customers we had in 2013.
We believe that our leading market positions will allow us to benefit from growth prospects across the industrial segments we serve. We supply customers that operate across a range of end markets that we believe possess positive growth outlooks, such as the trucks and passenger vehicles and the yellow goods/construction equipment markets, which are expected to grow due to, among other things, increased construction activity on the back of economic recovery. We also expect the global oil & gas market to continue to grow due to an increase in exploration and production spending and the liberalization of off-shore exploration. We expect our energy production end market growth to be driven mainly by improvements in the technical performance of equipment, the replacement demand for aging power stations and anticipated regulatory changes.
High barriers to entry within the engineering steel industry
We believe that our position in the engineering steel segment is protected by high barriers to entry which include the need for geographic proximity to customers, the high degree of knowledge and customer access required to produce customer specific products, and the need for high quality products which benefits producers with high brand recognition. Customers' demand for specialized products in small batch sizes and just-in-time delivery means that it is important for a manufacturer of engineering steel to be close to its customers geographically, which creates a high barrier to entry for new European market entrants from the United States or Asia.
The high degree of specification of products in the engineering steel segment also creates a high barrier to entry due to the fact that many of our products have been developed especially for and with our customers. These customers may incur switching costs if they were to change their supplier of engineering steel products. We have developed our reputation over a long period of time, which we believe represents another high barrier to entry. Many of the products we supply to our customers are critical to their end products and they rely on the reputation of our brand for providing products that demonstrate durability, strength and susceptibility to extreme temperatures.
Flexible business set up across technical sales, production and logistics for small order volumes
We believe we have developed a flexible business set up that enables us to profitably produce complex products in small volumes. Customers also often require their engineering steel
2

supplier's close proximity to their own production facilities in order to participate in the product engineering and design process and to reduce the risk of supply chain lags, as well as to maintain lower transportation costs. Our production facilities and finishing centers are all located in close proximity to many of our key customers, which we believe is a significant advantage. Our main production and research and development centers are located in Sweden and Finland while in 2013 the Nordics accounted for 39.3% of our net sales and Western Europe accounted for 44.5% of our net sales. We have built up a sales force in all our major markets with close proximity to our key customers, facilitating a shorter response time and direct access to our customers in their own language. We have an experienced employee base with what we believe to be exceptional product know-how, particularly in steel metallurgy and research and development generally. This enables us to work together with our customers to supply steel for demanding applications with important properties, such as fatigue life, machinability and low levels of micro inclusions for applications where clean steel is vital. For example, in January 2013, Patrik Olund, our head of R&D was awarded the prestigious Kami Prize for his contribution to the development of our IQSteel.
In addition to geographic proximity, we have invested in a flexible asset base that allows us to produce small volumes with fast lead times. We have designed our equipment, and in some cases made our own modifications, to make it easier for us to run short campaigns and short sequences. This enables us to quickly produce small batches of complex products for many customers. In certain instances our products are unique and enable cost savings in our customers' production processes or confer a longer life to their final products, which may outweigh logistics costs for potential customers located further from our production facilities. We believe many of our non-European customers purchase our products despite logistics costs and longer lead times because of the high degree of specification that we provide them.
Leading market positions in Western Europe with presence in the United States and Asia
We have a leading position in a number of segments, such as bearings, and have the highest portion of bearing steel volume of any European steel producer. We have a number of European competitors, however, few to none of those serve the same customer base with the same breadth of different grades and shapes. In 2013, Western Europe (excluding the Nordics) and the Nordics accounted for 44.5% and 39.3%, respectively, of our total net sales. Based on net sales, our main geographic markets are Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Finland, which accounted for 71.4% of our total net sales in 2013. Sweden and Germany together accounted for 52.1% of our total net sales in 2013. We believe that our leading market position in the Nordics and our foothold in Western Europe are a key advantage, particularly in Sweden and Germany as these markets tend to be more resilient following economic downturns, as demonstrated by the 3.7% and 4.0% increases in GDP in Sweden and Germany, respectively, during the period from 2010 to 2012 compared to the less than 2% increases in each of France, the United Kingdom and Finland during the same period. We also have a small but growing presence in Asia and an existing presence the United States to serve our local customers. Most of our customers in China and Asia were originally customers in another region, most often the Nordics or Western Europe, but we recently also acquired several new customers in China and in Asia.
Diversified group of loyal and well known customers
We have a diversified client base with over 2,000 customers, many of which are leaders in their end markets and their fields, some of whom we supply across a range of different geographic locations and end-markets. Our broad customer diversification helps to lower our reliance on any individual customer or end market. Our customers are loyal, as evidenced by our high proportion of repeat customers. Approximately 97.5% of volumes sold to our top 1,000 customers in 2013 were purchased by repeat customers that had placed orders with us in 2012. We believe our customer loyalty reflects high customer satisfaction. For example, in 2014 Bosch awarded us the title "Preferred Supplier" for the seventh year in a row.
3

In addition to building a diverse customer base, we have established and maintained long-term relationships with our top customers as evidenced by the fact that we have been doing business with each of our top ten customers for at least nine years and with seven of our top ten customers for more than 20 years. Our top ten customers accounted for 40% of our net sales in 2013. We have supplied several of our top ten customers across a number of their assembly and production locations in different geographies both in Europe and other regions. In addition, we supply products geared to a number of different end market segments to several of our top ten customers, which creates a further level of diversification within this group.
Well invested asset base with recent investments to drive cost efficiencies and future growth
We have invested significant capital over the last three years to expand our technological capabilities and product range, react to changes in market demand and address maintenance, environmental, health and safety requirements and surcharge expenses. Over the past three years, our capital expenditures included EUR7.6 million in connection with a new automated peeling line at our rolling mill Hllefors to expand our capacity to meet the demand for common rail high pressure diesel injection systems, EUR7.6 million in connection with a new ring mill in Hofors to extend our product lines and cater for the increase we expect in the demand for large rings for power generation (including wind mills), EUR10.0 million in connection with the modernization of our tube mill in Hofors to reduce personnel, energy costs and improve yield, and EUR13.2 million in connection with a new state of the art de-dusting filter at our steel mill in Smedjebacken to meet future environmental regulations and to reduce the risk of business disruption. In addition, in July 2014 we intend to replace the continuous casting machine at our steel mill in Smedjebacken to reduce maintenance costs and support new growth opportunities, at a total expected capital expenditure of EUR14.0 million. In 2013, we also spent an additional EUR1.1 million on the acquisition of BE Group activities in China to support our customers in Asia with specific high-value products through sales and warehousing services. We believe that these investments, together with a number of other smaller strategic growth and cost savings investments made over the past three years position us to capture future growth opportunities and benefit from cost efficiencies.
Our total capital expenditure amounted to EUR33.5 million, EUR48.2 million and EUR44.9 million in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, of which EUR14.6 million, EUR21.0 million and EUR21.0 million, respectively, was attributable to expansion capital expenditure. As a result of our significant investments over the past three years, we expect our average annual capital expenditures going forward to be at lower levels than it has been in the past three years. We estimate that, in the medium term, our total capital expenditure will be between EUR25 million and EUR35 million per year, of which between approximately EUR15 million and EUR20 million per year is expected to be attributable to maintenance capital expenditure to maintain the current state of our operations.
Restructuring initiatives with lower cost base and increased business
Our management defined a strategy in 2011 setting out the steps to make Ovako more resilient in light of the recent economic downturn. This new strategy was based on the new market situation, with a focus on: (i) a long-term process improvement program to support profitability and reduce our break even point; (ii) an improvement in customer service to defend our market position and premium pricing; and (iii) the development of new volumes from new markets to decrease the impact of economic cycles. As a result of this strategy, we believe that we have become a more resilient business and reduced both our fixed costs, in particular costs in relation to our headcount and maintenance costs, and variable costs, in particular costs in relation to raw materials, energy and logistics. As a result of our cost reduction initiatives, our fixed costs decreased, on a constant currency basis, by EUR22.0 million, or 6.8%, from EUR325.0 million in 2011 to EUR303.0 million in 2013. This decrease was partly driven by our headcount reductions from 3,239 as of December 31, 2011 to 2,995 as of December 31, 2013 as production shifts at our
4

steel mills were reduced and flexible work time agreements in Sweden and Finland were implemented. Our variable costs have decreased primarily as a result of reduced energy costs as a result of our new electricity price hedging policy, reduced transportation costs as a result of renegotiated transportation agreements in Eastern Europe and centralization and optimization of purchasing of supplies. In addition, we have taken steps such as broadening our geographic markets to lower the volatility of the past caused by macro-economic cycles. We believe the changes put in place by our management will serve as a foundation for continued recovery and an improved business portfolio.
Raw material cost pass through contracts supporting relatively stable Contribution margins
Raw materials accounted for 44.6%, 37.8% and 36.2% of our total cost of goods sold in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Steel scrap and alloys are the principal raw materials we use. Unlike most long product carbon steels, our engineering steel sales typically include scrap and alloy surcharge clauses, effectively passing on the raw material price to our customers. Our customer agreements with raw material price pass through typically allow us to adjust the scrap and alloy surcharge on a monthly basis. These frequent surcharge adjustments allow us to minimize the time lag for pass through. We estimate that a significant majority of our sales volume in 2013 was subject to agreements that enable us to pass along price increases in scrap and alloys through a surcharge mechanism, which helps us to maintain our Contribution margin when the prices of these raw materials fluctuate. While the remaining sales volume is sold based on contracts which do not allow us to pass on increases of scrap and alloy prices to customers, we manage our exposure under these contracts by frequently renegotiating the prices on a monthly and quarterly basis, which allows us to set prices in accordance with our estimated raw material costs at the time the contracts are entered into. As a result of our carefully managed raw material cost pass-through, our exposure to raw materials price volatility is mitigated, which we believe is evidenced by our stable Contribution margin historically. We use Contribution, which we define as net sales less changes in inventories and work in progress, costs of raw materials and supplies, foreign exchange differences on purchased goods, energy costs and freight and distribution costs, and the Contribution margin, which we define as Contribution as a percentage of net sales, as a measure of the development of our sales prices compared to our direct variable costs. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, our Contribution margin was 39.7%, 39.4% and 40.3%, respectively and our Contribution margin for the three months ended March 31, 2014 Contribution margin was 43.5%.
Highly skilled and experienced management team
We believe we have a strong management team, led by our Chief Executive Officer Tom Erixon and supported by our Chairman of the Board Finn Johnsson, who joined Ovako in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The other members of our senior management team, Marcus Hedblom, Anders Henstrm, Gran Nystrm, Heikki Nyholm, Rickard Qvarfort, Mathias Tillman, Karin Lagerstedt Woolford and Carl-Michael Raihle, have an average of approximately 20 years of experience in steel and steel-related industries and an average of approximately 11 years experience with Ovako.
Our management has demonstrated an ability to manage our processes to efficiently create customized products specifically tailored to meet our customers' requirements. Our customers typically require their highly specialized products in relatively small volumes over many orders (average of 32 orders per customer per annum). These products are produced using more than 300 active feasible steel grades that can be formed into more than 10,000 variations of hot-rolled and forged shapes and several thousand combinations of value added services applied at finishing. With over 2,000 customers and an average volume of 300 tons per customer and an average of 108 thousand shipments per annum, we are set up to generate profits from small delivery volumes through an efficient and well managed production process. Management is currently in the process of implementing our 7P! program, which is a plan designed to further optimize growth, organization and processes.

Our strategy
Our aim is to create a long-term attractive position in the steel market by becoming the European leader in engineering steel, continuously developing our product offering and strengthening our customer relationships. We intend to be the premier manufacturer and supplier of engineering steel in Europe and to continue establishing our international position in selected niche areas. We believe this will be achieved by organic growth in our existing and new geographical markets, and through the evaluation of acquisitions and investments from time to time. We aim to maintain a highly reputable brand and supply world-class products based on leading application development, metallurgical expertise and production technology. We intend to develop our existing strengths toward our objective of becoming the most customer-oriented supplier of engineering steel. In this regard, we intend to continue to adapt our production processes to our customers' value chains, while offering our quality service and reliable delivery. In order to achieve our strategic objectives, we are prioritizing three areas: growth, efficient processes and increased coordination and economies of scale within our group ("One Ovako").
Pursue growth though improving our products and expanding our geographic markets
We plan to maintain organic growth through improvements to our existing materials used in our current applications in order to gain market share through the performance advantage of our products. For example, we are developing new steel grades under the BQ-Steel product brand to better serve our bearing steel customers, including our first bearing manufacturer in China. We also plan to enter into new applications to offer an alternative to competitors' materials in such applications, as we have successfully done in past with our IQ-Steel product brand and its use in diesel injection systems. This growth would be further supported by the continued integration of our internal processes and our customers' value chains and processes. We also aim to expand our presence in new geographical markets, such as Eastern Europe, the United States and China and Asia, by initially leveraging our relationships with key customers to establish ourselves in these markets and then attracting new customers. Most of our customers in China and in Asia were originally customers in another region, most often the Nordic countries or Western Europe, but we recently also acquired new customers in China and in Asia. We recently were awarded our first orders from local Chinese manufacturers. Through all of this we intend to maintain pricing that appropriately reflects the value of our materials and services.
Continue to implement more efficient processes in terms of purchasing, production and use of capital
We intend to continue to focus our efficiency improvement efforts on purchasing, operational efficiency and capital efficiency. We successfully reduced our freight and other distribution costs in 2013, in part due to the impact of lower transportation costs in Eastern Europe as a result of renegotiated transportation agreements, which became effective in late 2013. We have been able to pool the volumes of the group through our reorganized centralized purchasing function to take advantage of decreasing freight rates. We intend to continue to review our purchasing contracts to improve our terms and supplier performance. We have recently launched lean manufacturing programs at two of our sites with the intention of expanding the programs throughout the Group. We intend to realize growth without increasing inventories through more effective production planning and higher supplier performance.
Pursue increased coordination, centralize certain operations to take advantage of economies of scale and improve our competencies
In recent years, we have focused on increasing coordination between our different facilities and developing shared capacity in order to increase efficiency and take advantage of economies of scale. For example, we have centralized our research and development, information technology, finance, sales, marketing, and purchasing functions. In addition, group functions have been
6

improved, a common brand platform has been launched and a best-practice culture has been introduced, aimed at continuous development and improvement. We continue to seek to achieve a more flexible cost structure in order to be better equipped to respond to cyclical demand, while improving our functionality and competencies across all areas of our business, from purchasing to application development. We intend to continue to improve staff efficiency through removing redundancies and increasing competencies in certain key areas, particularly in the application development and research and development functions, to drive growth and pricing. Our customers typically require highly tailored products in relatively small volumes per order (9 tons per order on average). By providing special technical consultations to our customers and working closely with them to develop steel grades and product shapes that best suit their requirements, our customers become increasingly loyal to our products. Such products therefore typically have no standard market price and are difficult and costly to replace at short notice. We will also explore any options to further consolidate our current functions and operations to streamline our structure and improve efficiency.
Continue to implement our 7P! program
We are currently in the process of implementing our 7P! program which is aimed at improving profitability. Our 7P! program is how we plan to execute our strategies described above over the next three years. The main elements of our 7P! program are: (i) growth through our marketing plan for 2014; (ii) our pricing plan for 2014 targeting price increases; (iii) our new purchasing program; (iv) our functional improvement program targeting a net reduction in staff; (v) structural consolidation to reduce costs and increase efficiency; (vi) operational efficiency through cost down projects and continuous improvements to our processes; and (vii) capital efficiency by achieving growth without increasing our inventories.
Recent developments
We have agreed to join a group of French industrialists and investors in a bid for the assets of Ascometal, one of our key competitors based in France, which was placed in administration in March 2014. A decision by the court is expected before the end of May 2014. If the bid is successful, we will invest EUR 5 million for a minority equity stake of approximately 10% with no commitments to invest additional funds into Ascometal.
Our history
Our history is built on a legacy of strong Nordic steel production. The forerunners to Ovako were founded over 300 years ago, when manufacturing began in Hofors, Sweden in the 17th century, followed by Boxholm and Hllefors in the 18th century, and by Smedjebacken in 1856.
During the 20th century the business has been transformed several times, resulting in the privately owned Ovako of today. From the beginning of the 1960s, the forerunners to Ovako gradually redirected their focus from commercial steel to complex engineering steel products. This development required investments in research, product development and quality control. The mills in Smedjebacken, Hofors and Imatra became significant suppliers of steel for the automotive and engineering industries. In 1969, the Finnish companies Oy Vuoksenniska Ab and Oy Fiskars Ab combined their steel production in a new company, Ovako Oy. In 1986, the group Ovako Steel was founded through a merger between SKF Steel and Ovako Oy. Ovako Steel was then split up after a few years, and SKF became the sole owner of the Swedish part of Ovako Steel in 1991, keeping the name Ovako Steel.
In May 2005, Ovako was established by merging Fundia, Ovako Steel and Imatra Steel. The company was jointly owned by Rautaruukki, SKF and Wrtsil, combining their long products steel businesses. In November 2006, Ovako was initially sold to Pampus Industrie Beteiligungen and a Dutch group of investors, with Pampus Stahlbeteiligungs acquiring sole ownership in November 2007.
7

In August 2010, private equity investor Triton acquired the bar, bright bar, tube and ring businesses of Ovako and formed the new Ovako AB, excluding the former wire division's operations.
Our principal shareholder

The historical unaudited financial statement data as o f March 31, 2014 and for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 have been derived from the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The unaudited summary consolidated financial statements as o f March 31, 2014 and for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 have been prepared on a basis consistent with the basis on which our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared and, in the opinion o f our management, include all adjustments, consisting only o f normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation o f such financial statements. These interim results are not necessarily indicative o f results to be expected for the full year. The unaudited summary financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 were derived from combining the consolidated operating results o f the Parent Company for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 with the consolidated operating results o f the Parent Company for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and subtracting the consolidated operating results o f the Parent Company for the three months ended March 31, 2013. The unaudited summary financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 has been prepared solely for the purposes o f this offering memorandum and is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative o f our results o f operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date and is not prepared in the ordinary course o f our financial reporting. See "Presentation o f financial and other data".
The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial data has been derived by applying pro forma adjustments to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum and gives effect to the Refinancing and the use o f proceeds therefrom, as if it had occurred on April 1, 2013 for the pro forma income statement information and on March 31, 2014 for the pro forma balance sheet information. The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial data has not been prepared on the basis o f IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and is based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable but may differ from actual amounts. The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial data is for informational purposes only and does not purport to present what our results would actually have been had these transactions occurred on the dates presented or to project our results o f operations or financial position for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.
For more information regarding this financial information, see "Management's discussion and analysis o f financial condition and results o f operations". This financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum and discussed in "Management's discussion and analysis o f financial condition and results o f operations".

(1) Contribution is defined as net sales less (i) changes in inventories and work in progress, (ii) costs for raw materials and supplies, (iii) foreign exchange differences on purchased goods, (iv) energy costs and (v) freight and distribution costs. Contribution margin is defined as contribution as a percentage of net sales. Our management uses Contribution and the Contribution margin as measures for the development of our sales prices compared to our direct variable costs. Contribution is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Accordingly, it should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit as indicators of our performance. Contribution, as presented in this offering memorandum, may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies due to differences in the way this measures are calculated.
Contribution is calculated as follows:

Net s a l e s ....................................................................................................... . Change in inventories and work in progress............................................ . Raw materials and supplies (unaudited) .................................................... . Foreign exchange differences on purchased goods (unaudited) . . . Energy (unaudited) ................................................................................................ .

(2) EBITDA is defined as operating profit (loss) for the period before depreciation, amortization and impairments. EBITDA reflects the impact of charges resulting from matters that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations. We also present Adjusted EBITDA, where we add back restructuring costs. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins are defined as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of our net sales. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. Accordingly, they should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit as indicators of our performance, or as alternatives to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used by our management to monitor our performance and we believe that these measures are commonly used by investors. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in this offering memorandum, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these measures are calculated.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated as follows.

(a) Restructuring costs relate to non-recurring costs in connection with (i) reductions in our headcount and rent for premises no longer in use during the non-cancellable periods under a lease for 2012 and (ii) the reductions in our headcount for 2013.
(3) EBITDA per ton is defined as EBITDA divided by tons of our final product shipped to customers. Due to our ability to pass through a portion of our costs of goods sold to our customers, we believe that EBITDA per ton, when read together with IFRS measures, is a relevant measure to evaluate our performance. EBITDA per ton is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Accordingly, it should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity. EBITDA per ton is used by our management to monitor our performance and we believe that this measure is commonly used by investors. EBITDA per ton, as presented in this offering memorandum, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these measures are calculated.
(4) Trade working capital is defined as trade receivables plus inventories less trade payables and is calculated as follows:

We generally distinguish between expansion capital expenditure, which includes strategic growth and cost savings investments as well as investments due to regulatory requirements. We classify all other capital expenditure as maintenance capital expenditure.

(1) The unaudited pro forma financial data reflects the impact of the issuance of the Notes and the associated repayment of the Senior Credit Facilities and reflects the impact of certain cost saving actions that we have taken or will take (as described below). These figures are not intended to represent pro forma financial information prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act or other SEC requirements and have not been prepared on the basis of IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles.
(2) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, further adjusted to reflect events that occurred in the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 or are planned for 2014, as described below. We believe that this measure provides management and investors additional information related to the ongoing results of operations. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure computed in accordance with IFRS and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or net profit as indicators of our performance, or as alternatives to cash flows from operations as a measure of our liquidity.

(a) This represents the costs of salaries, social charges and pension costs provided to 30.6 full time equivalent employees who were made redundant and have left us in the period from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014, as if such employees had left on April 1, 2013.
(b) This represents the estimated costs of salaries, social charges and pension costs associated with 80.8 full time equivalent employees who will be made redundant, as if such employees had left on April 1, 2013. These planned headcount reductions have been approved by our board as part of our 2014 budget and are being implemented in 2014.
(c) In 2012, we spent EUR2.5 million on transporting our products from production units in Sweden to customers in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. A t the end of 2013 we entered into new transport agreements under more favorable pricing terms. Under the new agreements and assuming the same transportation volumes, destinations and batch sizes in the twelve months ending March 31, 2014 as those in the calendar year 2012 , we estimate we would have saved approximately EUR1.0 million over the full twelve months, of which we have already realized EUR0.5 million since the agreements came into effect. As our actual transportation volume in Eastern Europe in the twelve months ending March 31, 2014 was higher than in the calendar year 2012, our transportation cost savings based on actual transportation volume in the twelve months ending March 31, 2014, and assuming the same destinations and batch sizes as those in the calendar year 2012, would have been higher.
(d) This represents the estimated impact of our new electricity hedging policy, as if such new hedging policy had been fully effective since April 1, 2013. We have implemented the following changes in our hedging policy: (i) two year electricity hedging horizon instead of a five year electricity hedging horizon; (ii) decrease of our electricity hedging from approximately 80% to 100% of our estimated consumption to approximately 40% to 60% of our estimated consumption; and (iii) use of quarterly hedges instead of yearly hedges. The calculation of our savings is based on (i) a neutral 50% hedge level for the current and coming quarter, (ii) actual market prices for quarterly forward electricity contracts quoted on NASDAQ OMX at the time we would have entered into the contracts, (iii) actual market prices five market days before quarter end, and (iv) our estimated electricity consumption. We believe these changes allow us to be more responsive to changes in the outlook for electricity prices and avoid historical over-hedging mainly in the third quarter of the year when our electricity consumption is typically lower.
(e) This represents estimated electricity certificate savings as a result of the intra-group merger of Ovako Hellefors AB and Ovako Tube & Ring AB with Ovako Hofors AB on April 1, 2014, as if such merger had been effective since April 1, 2013.
(f) This does not take into account additional energy cost savings we expect to achieve as a result of certain investments made in the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 relating to the installation of a new temperature control system at Hofors and a new control system for one of our furnaces in SmeBox, which we expect to reduce our energy consumption. In addition, there are further investments, approved by our board as part of our 2014 budget, relating to the installation of a reheating furnace control system in Imatra, which are similarly expected to further reduce our energy consumption.
(3) Pro forma net financial debt reflects the total third party debt excluding finance lease liabilities, net of cash and cash equivalents of the Group, on a consolidated basis as of March 31, 2014 after giving effect to the Refinancing, including the issuance of the Notes and the use of proceeds thereof as contemplated under "Use o f Proceeds" as if it occurred on March 31, 2014. See "Use o f Proceeds" and "Capitalization".
(4) Pro forma interest expense for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 is calculated as interest expense adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing, including the issuance of the Notes and the use of proceeds thereof, as contemplated under "Use o f Proceeds" as if it occurred on April 1, 2013 and assuming that the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn and excluding the commitment fees under that facility and imputed interest expense on finance lease liabilities and financial income for such period. See "Use o f Proceeds" and "Capitalization".

Risk factors
An investment in the Notes involves a high degree o f risk. Prospective investors in the Notes should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this offering memorandum before investing in the Notes.
We believe that the following factors, individually or together, may affect our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes. Some o f these factors are contingencies and we are not in a position to express a view on the likelihood o f any such contingency occurring or not occurring. In addition, factors which are material for the purpose o f assessing the market risks associated with the Notes are also described below. If any o f the risks described below materializes, our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results o f operations, and accordingly the trading price o f the Notes, may be materially adversely affected. If that were to happen, the trading price o f the Notes may decline or we may be unable to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in connection with the Notes and you may lose all or part o f your investment.
We believe that the factors described below represent the material risks inherent in investing in the Notes, but our inability to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in connection with the Notes or otherwise perform our obligations under the Notes may occur for other reasons which may not be considered material risks by us based on information currently available to us or for reasons which we may not currently be able to anticipate. You should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this offering memorandum and reach your own views prior to making any investment decision.
The order in which the risk factors are presented does not necessarily reflect the likelihood o f their occurrence or the magnitude o f their potential impact on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows, results o f operations or on the trading price o f the Notes.
Risks relating to our business and industry
We operate in a cyclical industry and our financial performance is sensitive to adverse changes in the European and global economic conditions.
The global engineering steel industry is cyclical in nature. Demand and price for engineering steel products are sensitive to even small changes, both actual or in sentiment, of gross domestic product ("GDP") and industrial production growth, which as has occurred previously, may lead to a materially disproportionate corresponding decline in our volumes sold. The global engineering steel industry is more cyclical than GDP, which means that declines in our volumes sold are typically larger than the corresponding decline in GDP and industrial production. GDP growth and industrial production growth are significant drivers of the end markets in which our customers operate, in particular the automotive and transportation, the other engineering, the mining, the oil & gas exploration and extraction equipment and the energy production industries. Adverse changes in the European and global macroeconomic conditions directly affect demand for engineering steel products and therefore our sales volumes which are key drivers of our results of operations. In the event of adverse economic conditions, the reduction in real demand for engineering steel, which is at the beginning of the value chain for the products produced in our customers' end markets, is typically exacerbated by inventory destocking throughout the supply chain as industry participants, including our customers, look to preserve liquidity by reducing inventory.
The engineering steel industry has over the last decade experienced two significant corrections, which also had a significant negative impact on our results of operations. The first one started in the third quarter of 2008 and lasted for much of 2009, when the European and global economies experienced a significant downturn as part of the financial and economic crisis, which had a strong impact on industrial activity. According to IHS Economics, GDP in the European Union decreased by 4.5% from 2008 to 2009, and industrial production in the European Union declined by 14.6% in that same time period. The pronounced contraction in industrial activity had a significant impact on the engineering steel industry, which experienced a significant fall in
20

demand for engineering steel products. As a result, our sales volume decreased by more than half, from 989 kt in 2008 to 418 kt in 2009 and our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009 were significantly negatively affected.
The second half of 2009 to the first half of 2011 were generally characterized by positive developments in the European and global markets, as key emerging and developing economies demonstrated stronger economic growth, supported by government stimulus initiatives. According to IHS Economics, GDP in the European Union increased by 2.0% in 2010 over 2009, and industrial production in the European Union likewise grew by 5.6% in that same time period. As a result, our sales volume increased to 851 kt in 2011 and our EBITDA reached EUR134.2 million in 2011.
However, in the later part of the second half of 2011, primarily as a result of the turbulence in the financial markets and the unresolved sovereign debt issues in Europe there was a significant drop in confidence regarding the economic outlook and expected GDP growth in Europe.
This developed into the second contraction in recent years, as we saw a weak fourth quarter of 2011 and then experienced a drop in demand for our products and significant decrease in our shipment volume to 694 kt in 2012, which resulted in a decrease in our EBITDA to EUR66.0 million in 2012. For a discussion of our financial position at the years ended 2011, 2012 and 2013, please see "Management's discussion and analysis o f financial condition and results o f operations-- Comparison between the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011" and "Management's discussion and analysis o f financial condition and results o f operations-- Comparison between the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012".
Our sales volume in the second half of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 were higher than in the corresponding periods in the previous years. Nevertheless, the recovery of the engineering steel industry is still slow and we cannot determine whether it will last and whether it will be significant. Even if the recovery became significant, we do not expect that demand will reach the levels that we experienced in 2006 to 2008 when insufficient capacity for production of machinery and equipment in Asia fuelled an increased demand for European exports of engineering steel. Since that time, local production capacity in Asia has increased, making it unlikely that such demand pressure will reoccur. European economies continue to experience uncertainty and while economic activity appears to improve across the Eurozone recently, the potential slowdown in the Chinese economy and, most recently, the uncertainties in connection with Russia and Ukraine are factors that could negatively impact the recovery of the engineering steel market globally.
Global economic conditions also remain fragile and the possibility remains that the European or the global economies, or certain industry sectors of those economies that are key to our sales, may not recover as quickly as anticipated, or could deteriorate, which would likely result in a decreased demand for our products and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
The engineering steel industry is highly competitive.
We face significant competition, primarily based on quality, delivery performance and price. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may be unable to maintain or increase our market share or margins. The highly competitive nature of our industry, combined with excess production capacity for some engineering steel products, has at times exerted downward pressure on prices of our products. Going forward, it is possible that excess production capacity may continue to exert downward pressure on prices and if such prices were as a consequence to decline to a level at which we are unable to remain profitable, we would be forced to close production facilities or suspend production entirely.
Our most significant competitors are mainly regional steel producers in Western Europe and select Eastern European mills. Since the economic downturn in 2008, the European engineering steel industry has suffered from production overcapacity in select products and increasing
21

competition amid reduced demand. Recently, Ascometal, one of our key competitors based in France, was placed in administration in March 2014, following an inability to reach a settlement with their creditors from a prior leveraged buyout. A number of our competitors have initiated modernization plans, which may improve the design, performance and efficiency of their products and their ability to develop new products or decrease their prices and we expect our competitors will continue to build on any advantages they have. Some of these competitors may have greater financial resources and benefit from lower operating costs.
In addition, we may face competition from competitors located outside of Europe that have not traditionally been sources of significant competition for us. Competitors, especially those in Asia, Eastern Europe and Russia, have substantially increased their production capacity in the last few years, and have targeted the European market for imports of certain engineering steel products. Imports of engineering steel into Western Europe from Eastern Europe and Russia have increased materially since 2008. Increasing demand for engineering steel could increase the number of competitors located outside of Europe who may be better placed than we are to gain market share.
Further, maintaining and expanding our market position will require continued investment in product development, sales and marketing and customer service and support and we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments. Our ability to compete effectively also depends to a significant extent on our continuous ability to manage our cost base and our competitors may be more successful than we in achieving or maintaining a competitive cost base. Our ability to compete effectively could also be negatively affected by an increase of the SEK against the Euro, which will make it more difficult for us to compete against our competitors in the Eurozone.
We may not be able to compete effectively in the future. Failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
The substantial majority of our net sales are concentrated to Western Europe and the Nordics, in particular Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Finland. In addition, Eastern Europe is a significant market for us. An economic decline in Europe, generally, or in these countries, specifically, or a protracted period of weak growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In 2013, we derived 44.5%, 39.3% and 9.2% of our net sales from customers in Western Europe (excluding the Nordics), the Nordics and Eastern Europe, respectively. Customers in our core markets of Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Finland accounted for 71.4% of our total net sales in 2013 and Sweden and Germany together accounted for 52.1% of our total net sales in 2013. Our sales have been concentrated in Western Europe, the Nordics and Eastern Europe generally because of the close proximity of these markets to our manufacturing plants in Sweden and Finland and our long established relationships with customers in these regions. The overall success of our operations, therefore, is closely tied to the economic prosperity and stability of Western Europe and the Nordics generally and Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Finland in particular, and to a lesser extent on Eastern Europe.
Many of our core markets have experienced severe economic downturns. According to CSO Finland, National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), OECD, Statistics Sweden and UK Office for National Statistics (ONS), in the period from 2007 to 2009, the GDP of Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Finland declined by 5.7%, 4.3%, 3.2%, 5.6% and 8.3%, respectively. In 2012, the GDP of some of our core markets was also negatively affected. In 2012, the economic environment in many of our markets has been marked by generally weaker than expected growth, increased unemployment and reduced business confidence. According to Eurostat, Business Monitor International, INSEE, ONS and Statistics Sweden, in the period from 2010 to 2012, the GDP of Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Finland increased by 3.8%, 4.0%, 2.0%, 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively.
Both we and our customers continue to be vulnerable to economic downturns and protracted periods of weak growth in these economies. During such periods of weakness, our customers
22

could face significant difficulties, possibly leading to bankruptcy proceedings. We cannot easily diversify our geographical customer base because of the significant cost of shipping many of our products to other markets and because of the importance of close collaboration in engineering and flexible delivery times. Any significant decrease in demand for engineering steel products or decline in the base price of these products, particularly in Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Finland, could result in significantly reduced profitability.
Additionally, the recent sovereign debt crisis in certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, and the related European financial restructuring efforts or government-sponsored rescue packages, may cause the value of the European currencies, including the euro and Swedish krona, to deteriorate, which, in turn, could adversely impact the European economy as a whole or lead to a new economic downturn, or lead to departures of countries from the Eurozone, introducing volatility into local and global markets. In addition, to the extent that any such rescue package has a deleterious effect on the euro or leads to increased taxes or austerity measures in stronger European economies, such as Germany, which is one our core markets, the economic troubles outside of those markets may, nonetheless, lead to macroeconomic effects that could result in significantly reduced revenues, thereby adversely affecting our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
We are significantly dependent on our customers' end markets, in particular the automotive and transportation, other engineering, mining, oil & gas exploration and extraction equipment and energy production end markets.
Because we are at the beginning of the supply chain, we are highly dependent on demand in the end markets in which our customers operate, in particular the automotive and transportation, other engineering, mining, oil &gas exploration and extraction equipment and energy production end markets. The automotive and transportation and other engineering end markets are cyclical just as is the engineering steel industry. We estimate that, excluding sales to distributors, the automotive and transportation end markets, the other engineering industry, the mining, oil &gas exploration and extraction equipment and the energy production end markets each accounted for approximately 40%, 30%, 10% and 5%, respectively, of our total net sales in 2013. We estimate that the remaining 15% of our total net sales in 2013 were derived from distributors. We do not have estimates of the end-markets to which distributers sell our products but we believe that most of our products sold to distributers are purchased by customers in the other engineering industry and automotive and transportation industry. Within the automotive and transportation end markets, we are particularly dependent on demand for heavy trucks and construction equipment, which account for most of our revenue from the automotive and transportation end market, and to a lesser extent on the demand for passenger cars. Our results of operations are therefore particularly affected by changes in the demand for trucks and construction equipment, which is more sensitive to actual or expected changes in economic conditions generally and changes in GDP specifically, than the demand for passenger cars. A decline in demand in any of our end markets, in particular in automotive and transportation and other engineering end markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
If we were to lose order volumes from any of our customers, our sales volumes, revenues and cash flows could be reduced.
We manufacture products for certain niche industries. As such, our business is exposed to risks related to a degree of customer concentration. Our top ten customers represented 40% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013, with our largest customer representing 15% of our total net sales. A loss of order volumes from, or a loss of industry share by, any major customer could lower sales volumes, increasing our proportion of costs to net sales and lowering profitability and forcing the temporary or permanent closure of one or all of our production facilities, in its turn negatively impacting our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
23

Our business could be disrupted if our customers shift either their manufacturing or sourcing requirements offshore.
Much of our business depends on maintaining close geographical proximity to our customers because the costs of transporting metals across large distances can be significant relative to their sales price and due to the importance of close collaboration in engineering and flexible delivery times. For example, our five largest customers who accounted for 31% of our net sales in 2013 each had engineers and management in Sweden and Finland who were significantly involved in the specification of our steel grades and our process customization. There are concerns that automotive and transportation manufacturing and assembly may gradually shift to lower cost regions outside Western Europe and the Nordics. This relocation trend has to date primarily affected assembly facilities and not production of mission-critical automotive, transportation, and general engineering components, such as engines, which remain located in Western Europe. However, any relocations by our customers of parts of their business which we supply, in particular the manufacturing of automotive, transportation and construction equipment, could lead to us losing business to competitors located outside of Europe and may disrupt or end our relationships with some customers. To date, we have limited our investments in regions outside Western Europe and the Nordics to sales and marketing. If our customers were to relocate parts of their business that is relevant to us, we may have to invest in production facilities outside of Europe. To the extent we are unable to expand internationally when our customers do so, it could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
We do not have long-term contractual arrangements with our customers and our sales volumes could decrease if our customers reduce or delay purchase orders or switch their suppliers.
Substantially all our customer contracts have a term of one year or less, are non-exclusive and do not oblige our customers to purchase a minimum volume. Customers typically purchase products from us on a purchase order basis and may reduce their volume demand for our products or choose not to continue to purchase our products altogether. In addition, due to the nature of the end markets that we serve, our customary arrangements generally permit customers to delay orders. Our customers may choose to purchase substitute products from our competitors if, for example, such products are offered at lower prices, competitors offer more flexible contractual arrangements, or if our customers elect to diversify their suppliers. While, it may not be easy for some customers to switch suppliers on short notice our customers may choose alternative suppliers over the time. Unless we are able to replace lost sales volumes with new business, the loss of customers, a significant reduction in purchase orders or significant delays in purchase orders could have a material negative impact on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
We have a significant cost base at any level of production.
Our cost base consists primarily of raw material costs, employee related costs and energy related costs. At any level of production at which we have the ability to operate, we have a high cost base as a proportion of our net sales. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, our costs of goods sold amounted to 94.9%, 92.8% and 87.2%, respectively, of our net sales. In the medium to long term we are able to adjust our level of production to reduce our cost base. However, in the short term we do not have such flexibility. In addition, a majority of our cost base is fixed, such as the majority of our employee related costs, and cannot be reduced by changes in our level of production. If we are unable to substantially reduce our cost base to offset a decline in sales volumes, it will have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Any decrease in profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
24

We may be unable to realize any benefits from our ongoing or future cost savings and efficiency programs, such as our profit improvement program 7P!.
In recent years, we have undertaken several significant projects in an effort to lower our costs and enhance our efficiency. These have included efforts to streamline purchases of raw materials and energy, gain efficiencies in product distribution, reduce logistics costs and lower fixed costs. Currently, we are implementing a new profit improvement program 7P!. The program aims to both expand marketing efforts and further improve operational efficiencies to reduce our cost base and offer more competitive prices for our products. Our ability to compete successfully and remain profitable depends on us materially achieving the targets of our ongoing and future cost savings and efficiency programs and that the targets have the intended effect. To the extent that we are unable to meet one or more of the targets, or that targets are significantly less effective in achieving the level of combined cost-savings or margin enhancement than we anticipate, or that we do not achieve such results as quickly as we anticipate, our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.
We depend on the availability of energy resources used in our manufacturing processes, in particular electricity, LPG, fuel oil and natural gas. Any increase in the cost of energy resources could cause our cost of goods sold to increase, thereby reducing operating results and limiting our operating flexibility.
The energy resources our business depends on are electricity, LPG, fuel oil and natural gas for running the electric arc furnaces and our heat treatment furnaces. We use a significant amount of electricity and are heavily impacted by the electricity price and to a lesser extent by the prices of LPG, fuel oil and natural gas. The price and availability of such energy resources are affected by domestic factors in Sweden, Finland and neighboring countries relating to, among other things, usage by other consumers, the capacity of power generating facilities and environmental and other regulatory requirements, as well as external factors relating to, among other things, operating costs of power generation, global prices for crude oil and political and economic factors. Prices for such energy resources have historically varied and may continue to vary significantly and such variations are beyond our control. The European Climate and Energy Package (CEP) and other requirements relating to greenhouse gases could have a significant impact on the energy markets in Europe and could, therefore, also affect our energy costs. The implementation of European Union-level and national directives within the CEP is currently ongoing and includes a number of significant uncertainties. In particular, recently electricity prices have fluctuated significantly. Average spot prices in EUR per MWh for electricity on the NASDAQ OMX market were 47.1, 31.2 and 38.1 in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.
Additionally, disruptions in the supply of electricity or any other of our energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture products for our customers. We generally purchase electricity in the spot market, primarily NASDAQ OMX, except for one supply agreement at a fixed price in Finland, which covered approximately 26% of our electricity demand in Finland in 2013. This supply agreement will expire in December 2015. We generally enter annual supply contracts for LPG, fuel oil and natural gas. Unlike with respect to LPG, fuel oil and natural gas, we have historically hedged the majority of our variable price of electricity through separate hedges by entering into financial contracts, either bilaterally or over the NASDAQ OMX market. We changed our electricity prices hedging policy in the spring of 2012. Under our new policy, we hedge the price of our anticipated electricity consumption in the coming 24 months. We hedge between 40% and 60% of our anticipated electricity consumption for the next 12 months and between 20% and 50% of our anticipated electricity consumption in the following 12 months. At year-end 2013, our anticipated electricity consumption for 2014 and 2015 was hedged as follows (including the long-term supply agreement in Finland, which will expire in December 2015): 57% for 2014 and 38% for 2015. As a result of our policy to hedge a smaller portion of our anticipated electricity consumption going forward and to conclude shorter dated hedges, any significant increases in spot prices which are not hedged could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

We are exposed to currency exchange rate movements, in particular the EUR/SEK exchange rate.
Our operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the EUR, while a portion of our revenue and large share of our expenses are denominated in other currencies. The greatest currency risk is linked to SEK, primarily because a large part of our production costs are in SEK. In 2013, sales in EUR accounted for 61% of our total net sales, compared to 28% in SEK, 4% in GBP and 5% in US$. Going forward, currency exchange rate movements may additionally impact our ability to make payments under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility for which payments are in EUR and possibly SEK, GBP and USD. In addition, we are exposed to currency mismatches with respect to certain capital expenditures in countries in which we operate. When we translate our result of operations, financial position, cash flows and changes in equity into EUR for the purpose of preparing our consolidated financial statements that are expressed in EUR, the EUR amounts will vary in accordance with applicable exchange rates. Sudden increases in inflation or the devaluation of these currencies or other currencies in which we generate revenue, have had, and may continue to have, a materially impact on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
From time to time we may decide to hedge contractual net exposures from sales and purchases in currencies other than the base currency or trading currency to hedge margins. No currency derivatives existed for most of 2013 but in November 2013 we signed a foreign exchange forward contract that hedges approximately 37% of the estimated net outflow in SEK during 2014, with a total value of approximately EUR75 million. Our hedging activities may not eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure at an acceptable cost, or at all. Failure to do so could have a materially adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Engineering steel production is capital intensive and we may not be able to fund our capital expenditures as planned.
The growth of our business requires significant capital expenditures, including in the areas of product line extensions, production plant maintenance and transportation as well as compliance with current and future obligations under environmental laws and regulations. We rely on cash flows from our operating activities and on external sources of funding, including third-party borrowings, to finance our capital expenditures. In 2013, we recorded capital expenditures, representing additions to property, plant, equipment and intangible assets, of EUR44.9 million as compared to EUR48.2 million and EUR33.5 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. In 2014, we have on going and planned capital expenditures, including in particular relating to the continuous casting machine at the steel mill in Smedjebacken, Sweden.
Directive 2010/75/EU of November 24, 2010 on Industrial Emissions (as amended, the "IE Directive"), applies common rules for permitting and controlling industrial installations. Emissions to air, soil or water, as well as noise and safety are all covered by the IE Directive. Sweden implemented the IE Directive on June 18, 2013 by amendments to the Swedish Environmental Act and by passing six new regulations. Finland is still in the process of fully implementing the IE Directive and it is expected that the IE Directive will be implemented during 2014. The IE Directive will result in a stricter environmental oversight of our production facilities, particularly with respect to atmospheric emissions. It is likely that the implementation of the IE Directive and respective updates of environmental permits will require us to invest in additional emission reduction measures for one or more of our production facilities. These processes are expected to be ongoing for many years.
Our ability to obtain financing at acceptable costs and in amounts sufficient to meet on going, planned and future capital expenditures could be materially adversely affected by many factors beyond our control, including the state of the economies of the countries in which we operate and our ability to obtain credit. In the short term, we are able to delay capital expenditures including routine maintenance for a period generally up to one year without significant damage
26

to our equipment. Longer periods of delay could have a materially adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In general, we believe we currently need to spend in the range of EUR15.0 million to EUR20.0 million per annum on maintenance capital expenditure, though the actual amount we incur may be higher or lower.
Our ability to adequately implement capital improvements may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the terms of existing financing arrangements, changes in economic conditions, plant and machine breakdowns, adverse events such as fire, explosions and floods, environmental incidents, regulatory developments, product or specification changes, delays in project completion, cost overruns, and defects in design or construction. For example, any delays to the completion of the continuous casting machine project at the steel mill in Smedjebacken, which we plan to perform in July of this year, could have a significant negative effect in our results of operations.
Our potential inability to finance on going, planned and future capital expenditures or to finance such expenditures at an acceptable cost or at all may have a materially adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
The raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are subject to price fluctuations and changes in availability which could increase our costs of goods sold.
Scrap steel and alloys are the principal raw materials we use. We require substantial amounts of these raw materials. The price and availability of our raw materials fluctuates depending on local and international supply and demand due to, for example, interruptions in production and sourcing by suppliers, supplier allocation to other purchasers, concentration of the suppliers and increases in transportation costs. In 2013, approximately 30% of our total raw material purchases were supplied by our ten largest suppliers. We estimate that a majority of our sales volume in the year ended December 31, 2013 was subject to agreements that permit us to pass increases in scrap and alloy costs to our customers. The remaining sales volume is sold based on contracts which do not allow us to pass on increases of scrap and alloy prices to our customers. However, for these customers we manage our exposure to fluctuations in scrap and alloy prices by making these sales on a monthly or quarterly basis, which allows us to set prices in accordance with our raw material costs at the time such contract is entered into. We therefore do not enter into hedging agreements with respect to prices of raw materials.
Our scrap and alloy agreements with pass-through allow us to adjust the scrap and alloy surcharge on a monthly basis. Our scrap steel and alloy price pass-through mechanisms in our customer contracts have an explicit raw material surcharge component, and we have generally been able to pass on increases in the prices of raw materials to our customers. The time it takes us to produce a product (our internal process time) is typically longer than the contractually agreed reference period used to determine the average scrap and alloy prices used for the sale of our products (contractually agreed surcharge reference period). Synchronizing our internal process time and the contractually agreed surcharge reference period is important because it allows us to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of scrap and alloy. More specifically, in periods of falling scrap and alloy prices and if the contractually agreed surcharge reference period is shorter than our internal process time, we may have to purchase scrap and alloy at higher costs that we may not be able to fully pass on to our customers.
Our inability to secure adequate raw materials at commercially reasonable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Any significant change in the prices or supply of the raw materials used in our manufacturing processes, or in our general ability to pass through such costs to customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
27

Technical failures, outages and other interruptions of manufacturing equipment or operating systems could materially impact our business and financial situation.
When business conditions permit, we operate our production plants at levels at or near capacity. High levels of production are important to our financial results because they enable us to spread our fixed costs, over a greater number of tons. Plant outages or equipment failures requiring significant time and resources to repair, as well as the occurrence of adverse events, such as fires or explosions, could affect our manufacturing equipment, particularly under circumstances where we lack adequate redundant facilities. For example, we have had two fires during the last two years, one in May 2013 and one in August 2012, which both resulted in extended production stops. We did not suffer significant losses in connection with these production stops because both were covered by insurance. However, any future production stops may not be covered by insurance. We may also not be able to compensate for loss of production at one plant in the case of a technical failure, outage or other equipment interruption by shifting production to another plant.
In addition, the occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, adverse weather conditions, environmental or safety incidents or similar events or circumstances could significantly disrupt our operations, negatively impact the operations of other companies or contractors we depend upon in our operations, or adversely affect customers or markets to which we sell our products. For example, our facilities have experienced natural disasters such as floods in the past causing plant closures for several days. Any such significant disruptions or reduced levels of production may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
The performance of our business is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain high quality standards in the manufacture of our products.
The engineering steel market is characterized by highly specific technical requirements, such as levels of elasticity, strength, ductility, toughness and fatigue resistance. Our products are used in performance-critical end use products. A significant portion of our products are subject to severe environments in their end-use and subject to high performance requirements, such as high temperatures, exposure to hazardous substances, high speed and continuous pressure. The performance, quality and safety of our products are critical to the success of our business. These characteristics depend significantly on the effectiveness of quality control systems, which in turn depend on a number of factors, including the design of the systems and our ability to ensure that personnel adhere to quality control guidelines and policies. Any significant failure or deterioration of our quality control systems could result in the failure of our products. Failure or the perceived failure of our products to meet the required precise technical specifications could lead to significant expense for our customers, and result in product recalls, product liability claims or other significant costs to us. Product liability claims and product recalls, or any other issues with respect to the quality of our products, could harm our reputation both with our existing customers and with respect to potential new customers. Our inability to meet the quality and technical requirements required by the end markets that we serve and any failure or perceived failure of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Our licenses or third-party certifications may be suspended, amended, terminated or revoked prior to their expiration, and we may be unable to obtain or maintain various other permits or authorizations.
Our operations are subject to regulatory regimes, including licensing, and the receipt of various permits and authorizations, including the operations of our plants and subsidiaries. We voluntarily subject ourselves to third-party certification of the technical and quality standards of certain of our products, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Our production facilities are in the process of applying for an "integrated environmental permit" under national implementation of Directive 2008/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the
28

Council of January 15, 2008 (the "IPPC Directive"). We are required to hold licenses for the storage and processing of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, water use and discharge, emission and effluent discharge, power use and other operations. We have applied for the renewal of the license for our steel mill in Smedjebacken, Sweden and are in the process of submitting an application for license renewal for our steel mill in Hofors, Sweden. To date, we have been able to obtain and extend licenses, permits and authorizations necessary to carry out our current operations, but we may not in the future be able to obtain new or renew existing licenses or remain in compliance with some or all of the requirements imposed in connection with current or future licenses, permits and authorizations. If we fail to fulfill the requirements of our licenses or permits, regulatory authorities may impose fines on us or suspend, revoke or terminate our licenses and permits which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our plants. Regulatory authorities also may impose additional or more stringent obligations or operating limits under permits and licences we receive or renew in the future which would increase our costs or restrict our operations. Any failure by us to meet quality and technical requirements needed to receive the necessary third-party certifications or the loss of existing third-party certifications also may lead to the loss of business opportunities, which could lead to a decline in sales. Any such event may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
We depend on the supply chains of third parties and on the quality of the raw materials we purchase.
Our business could be negatively affected by transportation, raw material and energy supply disruptions, and the poor quality of raw materials, particularly scrap metal and alloys. Although there are alternative suppliers on the market, replacing a supplier may be time consuming and the terms available may not be as favorable as the terms in current supply agreements. We could also experience issues with the quality or composition of the raw materials we purchase, which for example may require that we incur additional costs related to higher cost alloys being added to a production process to maintain product specifications required by a customer. Further, we may be forced to purchase products from other suppliers for various reasons, including if a supply contract is not extended, if a supplier is not able to meet its delivery obligations or if a supplier faces financial or operational difficulties or disruptions. If we are unable to obtain adequate and punctual deliveries of required raw materials at acceptable prices, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products in a timely or profitable manner, especially those products that require long lead times or that involve complex manufacturing processes, which could harm our reputation, incur additional costs or delay new product introductions. In addition, switching the supplier of a certain raw material may negatively affect our production since we might be forced to carry out necessary adjustments to our production process as dictated by differences in quality and other characteristics of the raw materials.
Such disruptions or quality issues, whether the result of severe financial hardships or bankruptcies of suppliers, natural or man-made disasters or other adverse weather events, or other unforeseen circumstances or events, could reduce production or increase costs at one or more of our plants and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
In order to operate our business successfully, we must meet evolving customer requirements for engineering steel products and invest in the development of new products.
If we fail to develop or enhance our products to satisfy evolving customer demands, our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects may be harmed significantly. The market for engineering steel products is characterized by periodic new product introductions, certification requirements and evolving customer and industry standards that are each generally driven by technological advances. Our customers are continuously adapting to changing technologies and in turn, we must effectively and timely anticipate and adapt to customer requirements and offer products and services that meet customer demands. Our competitors are doing the same and may be able to produce more cost-effective products or substitutes for engineering steal products.
29

Our strategy may require that we at times expand our product and service offering through acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances and incur additional costs related to steel grade and process customization and innovation, which despite substantial costs may not lead to the development of a product that meets customer demands. Despite our best efforts and substantial costs, we may experience design, engineering and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or marketing of new products and services. Our failure to successfully develop and offer products or services that satisfy customer requirements may significantly weaken demand for our products and services, which would likely cause a decrease in our net sales and harm our operating results. In addition, if our customers demand or competitors introduce products or services based on new or alternative technologies, our existing and future products and services could become obsolete, which would also weaken demand for our products or services, thereby decreasing our net sales and harming our operating results. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
The inability to hire or retain key members of our management team or other key employees may have an adverse effect on our operating results.
Our success has depended and will continue to depend, in part, on the efforts of our senior management and other key employees, including key members of our sales force. These individuals possess skills that are critical to the operation of our business. Additionally, given the specialized nature of our business and the highly technological manufacturing processes we use, our employees require specific technical training. The loss or an extended interruption in the services of one or more of our senior management or other key employees, including key members of our sales force or the failure to attract and retain suitably skilled personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Our business depends on good relations with our employees. A breakdown in these relations or stricter labor laws, as well as increasing costs of skilled labor, could have a material adverse impact on us.
Labor law in the countries where we operate provides a high level of protection to employees. Furthermore, most of our employees are members of labor unions and, accordingly, we are party to agreements with trade unions at our production plants. However, there can be no assurance that our agreements with trade unions will prevent strikes or work stoppages at any of our facilities, or that such agreements will be renewed on substantially similar terms and conditions in the future. In many cases, we have a legal obligation to consult with our employees, their representative bodies or trade unions on strategic and operational business decisions. These labor laws and consultation procedures might limit our flexibility to pursue new obligations or technologies, our ability to react in rapidly changing market conditions and our capacity to reduce our workforce if necessary. Failure by us to comply with such labor laws and consultation procedures could be held to be illegal and result in financial penalties.
The demand and, therefore, costs for skilled engineers and operators will continue to increase, also reflecting the significant demand from other industries. Continuous high demand for skilled labor and continued increases in labor costs could make it difficult for us to attract quality employees and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Any future work stoppages, disputes with employee unions or other labor-related developments or disputes, including renegotiation of agreements with unions, could result in a decrease in our production levels and adverse publicity and an increase in costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
30

We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental rules and regulations, which may significantly increase our compliance costs and require substantial investments and under which we can incur significant liabilities.
Due to the nature of our operations, we are subject to extensive laws, regulations, directives and permitting obligations of several jurisdictions relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters. As a result, we incur and expect to continue to incur significant costs complying with these requirements. Changes in application or scope of environmental requirements applicable to us also could have a significant adverse impact. Our operations generate significant amounts of pollutants and waste, some of which are hazardous. We also use hazardous compounds in our production processes. We are subject to a variety of environmental rules and regulations, including under Swedish, Finnish and other European laws. We are obliged to investigate and clean up environmental contamination on or from our properties and to comply with stringent waste management regulations, particularly in relation to hazardous waste. We are also required to obtain and comply with environmental permits, authorizations and licenses in connection with our operations, and these permits are subject to modification and renewal by issuing authorities. We cannot assure you that we will at all times be able to operate in compliance with these laws, regulations and permits, or prevent or limit air and waste water emissions in accordance with law. Failure to comply with environmental rules and regulations can result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, the suspension of permits, requirements to curtail or suspend operations, and lawsuits by third parties. In addition, the failure to renew our permits, authorizations and licenses in a timely manner or at all could lead to required plant shutdowns. In addition, many of our facilities have a long history of industrial operations. New or previously unknown contamination or other environmental conditions may be discovered at our production plants, for which we may be required to take remedial action in the future.
There is a global trend towards stricter environmental controls and we anticipate that this trend will continue. Compliance with future laws or regulations, the imposition of more stringent requirements for licenses, permits and authorizations and stricter or new interpretation of existing environmental laws and regulations may require us to make additional capital expenditures, modify our operating practices, pay fines for breaches of such laws or regulations, and carry out additional reporting obligations. For example, we are subject to significant requirements governing air emissions and greenhouse gases, which are expected to become more stringent. We are also subject to increasingly stringent requirements governing the use and management of hazardous materials, such as the REACH Regulation, which can increase our operating costs or result in restrictions or bans on the chemicals we use or that are contained in our products.
Costs related to our compliance with environmental laws and potential obligations with respect to contaminated sites are often difficult to accurately predict and may have a significant negative impact on our operating results. Our compliance with environmental requirements necessitates a commitment of significant financial resources, including environmental compliance expenses. The imposition of liabilities pursuant to environmental laws and regulations, including as a result of violations of such laws and regulations or required permits and claims by third parties for property damage or personal injury, or required operating changes resulting from such rules, could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The environmental rules and regulations applicable to us could also place us at a competitive disadvantage in relation to engineering steel producers located outside of the European Union.
We may be materially adversely affected by regulations regarding carbon dioxide emissions, unfavorable allocation of rights to emit carbon dioxide and other air emission related issues.
Substantial quantities of carbon dioxide are released as a consequence of our operations. Compliance with existing, new or proposed regulations governing such emissions, including the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ("ETS"), might lead to a need to reduce such greenhouse gas emissions, to purchase rights to emit from third parties, or to make other
31

changes to our business or capital investments, any of which could result in significant additional costs or could reduce demand for our products. Moreover, these regulations and the enforcement of those regulations tend to become more stringent over time. To date our carbon dioxide emissions have remained well below the amount of emission allowances granted to us under relevant laws and regulations, and we have been able to benefit from intra-Group transfers of allowances. However, going forward our emissions may increase in excess of our allowances causing us significant financial penalties.
For example, under the ETS, a certain amount of emission rights was allocated free of charge to companies until the end of 2012, thereby providing a no-cost cap on the carbon dioxide emissions of their production facilities. While European Union companies, including us, received all of their emission rights free of charge during the previous trading period (2008-2012), the ETS became more restrictive in the current trading period (2013-2020). From 2013 onwards, manufacturing companies generally have to purchase a steadily increasing amount of emission rights. Both the cap on total annual emissions in the European Union and the amount of emission rights allocated at no cost are gradually reduced by 2020. In the event that we do not receive sufficient carbon leakage protection, or are not otherwise allocated a sufficient amount of emission rights in the future, including free emission rights, our costs will significantly increase. Such costs are also dependent on the price of emission allowances, which currently is expected to increase. As a result, we may not be able to produce products that are competitive in terms of price, which would place us at a competitive disadvantage against companies not subject to the ETS. In addition, we are a significant purchaser of energy. Existing, new and proposed regulations relating to the emission of carbon dioxide by our energy suppliers could result in materially increased energy costs for our operations and we may be unable to pass along these increased energy costs to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, depending upon whether similar limitations are imposed globally, the regulations and legislation could negatively impact our ability to compete with foreign steel companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations.
Measures to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions that could directly or indirectly affect us or our suppliers are currently being developed or may be developed in the future. These existing and possible new regulations regarding carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, especially a revised ETS or a successor to the Kyoto Protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Our operations expose our employees to risk of injury or death. Health and safety laws, regulations and other legislation may increase our costs of doing business, restrict our operations, or result in the application of fines, revocation of permits and shutdown of our facilities.
We are required to comply with occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including, in Finland and Sweden where our operations are subject to periodic inspections by the relevant governmental authorities. These laws and regulations govern, among others: work place conditions, worker training, use of safety equipment, workers insurance coverage, and the handling, storage and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous substances. New regulations that may be applicable to us in the future could increase our operating costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
The manufacture and distribution of our products is an inherently dangerous activity which involves substantial risks and our workers are subject to accidents, some of which may result in injuries or death. We may not at all times be in full compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to us. Any violation of such laws or regulations could result in lengthy investigations, substantial fines, criminal sanctions, temporary or permanent shutdown of the affected
32

operations or facilities, the suspension or revocation of authorizations, permits or licenses, a decline in worker motivation and damage to our reputation.
Despite our efforts to monitor and reduce accidents at our facilities, health and safety incidents do occur, some of which may result in the death of a worker in addition to costs, liabilities and a negative impact on worker motivation and our reputation or the operations of the affected plant. Such accidents could include explosions, gas leaks, fires, exposure to potentially hazardous materials or other accidents such as occurred in December 2013 at the steel mill in Smedjebacken, Sweden and claimed the life of an employee. Some of our industrial activities may involve the use, storage and transport of hazardous substances, and we are therefore subject to the risk of industrial accidents which could have significant adverse consequences for our workers and facilities, as well as the environment. Such accidents could lead to production stoppages, loss of key personnel, the loss of key assets, or put our workers at risk or persons living near affected sites. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Our current and past operations involve the use of, and risk of exposure to, toxic or hazardous substances.
Our steel operations use, and have in the past used, certain hazardous substances, such as hexavalent chromium in plating operations and asbestos-containing materials in building components. Certain of our workers and the workers of other companies and service providers, both current and former have, or may have, worked under circumstances that exposed them to hazardous substances. As with most steel production plants, asbestos was used and is still present in certain building materials and equipment at our production plants. Persons exposed to hazardous materials may have developed, or may allege to have developed, specific pathologies from such exposure, which may result in claims against us for compensation. Judgments against us in relation to asbestos or other hazardous substance exposure litigation brought against us in the future may result in substantial monetary damages being awarded against us and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Adverse results in material litigation may significantly endanger our ability to run our business.
We have been involved, and may be involved in the future, in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In the case of employee-related matters, these claims include wrongful termination and employment-related injuries, among other claims. Customer-related claims include claims related to performance and quality of our products, among other claims.
These or future proceedings may result in substantial monetary damages, damage to our reputation and decreased demand for our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
The insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures and may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
We maintain customary insurance with respect to property, casualty and products liability, and other matters, but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental compliance or remediation. There can be no assurance that any insurance would be available on a timely basis or adequate to completely reimburse our losses that we might sustain. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, if at all, and our premiums may increase significantly on the coverage that we maintain. If we were to experience another fire or any other destructive event, our insurance may not completely reimburse us for the reconstruction of our facilities or forgone profits and our insurance costs could increase significantly.
33

Our products are used in safety-critical applications involving intense end-use conditions and high performance requirements, such as in the automotive and transportation industry. If our products fail and cause injury or death to customers or third-party, we may be subject to significant money damages. We have product liability insurance coverage, which may not be sufficient to cover all or any money damages. Accordingly, a major claim or a series of smaller claims for damages related to our products sold or customized steel grades, or advice given to customers in connection with products sold, may not be fully covered by insurance, or may not be covered by insurance at all.
Any insurance claims present a risk of protracted litigation, substantial money damages, reputational damages, attorneys' fees, costs and expenses and diversion of management's attention from the operation of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
We may incur additional liabilities in connection with our pension plans.
In certain countries, we have pension plans under which we have an obligation to provide agreed benefits to current and former employees. See "Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results o f operations--Pension Insurance Line". Our pension obligations under defined benefit plans may be significantly affected by changes in the discount rate, the expected return on the plans' assets, the rate of increase in salaries and pension contributions, changes in demographic variables or other events and circumstances. Changes to local legislation and regulation relating to defined benefit plan funding requirements may result in significant deviations in the timing and size of the expected cash contributions under such plans. In addition, the Original Pension Insurance Line that we will have entered on or prior to the issuance of the Notes (and any Additional Pension Insurance Line that we may enter into after the issuance of the Notes) is intended to pay our pension liabilities in the event we become insolvent and contains restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities. We cannot assure you that the Pension Insurance Line will be available or adequate to satisfy our pension obligations. We may incur additional liabilities relating to our pension plans, and these additional liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
We are directly and indirectly controlled by investment funds affiliated with Triton, and their interests as equity holders may conflict with yours as a creditor.
We are an affiliate of, and are controlled by, Triton. The interests of Triton may not always be aligned with yours. For example, our equity holders may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions, that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though these transactions might involve risks to the holders of the Notes if the transactions resulted in us being more highly leveraged or if they significantly changed the nature of our business operations or strategy. In addition, if we encounter financial difficulties, or if we are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of our equity holders might conflict with those of the holders of the Notes. In that situation, for example, the holders of the Notes might want us to raise additional equity to reduce our leverage and pay our debts, while our equity holders might not want to increase their investment in us or have their ownership diluted and instead choose to take other actions, such as selling our assets. Furthermore, Triton has no continuing obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing. Additionally, Triton is in the business of making investments in companies and currently holds, and may from time to time in the future acquire, controlling interests in businesses engaged in industries that complement or directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. Further, if Triton pursues acquisitions in the steel industry, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as Triton continues to directly and indirectly own a significant amount of our equity, it may continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our business decisions.
34

Future acquisitions, investments or divestitures may adversely affect our financial condition.
As part of our strategy we may in the future attempt to pursue acquisitions, investments, divestitures or strategic alliances, which may not be completed or, if completed, may not ultimately be beneficial to us. There are numerous risks commonly encountered in business combinations, including the risk that we may not be able to complete a transaction that has been announced, effectively integrate and operate businesses acquired, assume unanticipated liabilities or generate the cost savings and synergies anticipated. Such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, the process of pursuing such transactions, whether or not consummated, may divert management's attention from the day-to day operation of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We may be subject to liabilities and costs associated with our intellectual property.
We rely on trademarks to protect our brand name and patents to protect our inventions. Many of these trademarks are important to our business, and many of our patents protect key innovations. We believe that our intellectual property has significant value and is important to the marketing of our products and maintaining our competitive advantage. The steps we have taken or will take to protect our intellectual property may not provide adequate protection, and third parties may infringe our intellectual property, and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our intellectual property. In addition, our intellectual property may violate the proprietary rights of others, may not be upheld if challenged, we may be prevented from using any of them, any of which occurrences could harm our business. Loss of trademark protection would force us to rebrand our products and services, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Loss of patent protection could require us to abandon key processes or products that drive our profitability. Further, any claims of trademark or patent infringement may require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreement in order to obtain the right to use a third-party's intellectual property, which may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us.
Trade tariffs and barriers may adversely affect our operations and financial results.
Western Europe and the Nordics are our most significant markets. Trade barriers with Russia where one of our key competitors is located, were recently eliminated, which could have a material impact on our sales. If tariffs or barriers to trade with other non-European Union member states were reduced or eliminated, our sales could be materially affected. Political or other developments can affect trade policies and it is impossible to predict such changes. Adverse trade regulations in any of our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We have been, and will continue to be, exposed to trade and pricing practices by competitors. Several countries, including Russia, also grant direct and indirect subsidies to companies active in local steel industries. For example, Russia imposes restrictions on the export of scrap metal, which has allowed our Russian based competitors to take advantage of lower scrap metal prices and sell products similar to ours at a lower price. The pricing advantage enjoyed by these producers on their subsidized products may impair or eliminate our ability to compete with such producers, enter new markets or expand in our existing markets, such as Russia. This and other practices may further impair our profitability to the extent subsidized steel products are produced in or exported into our core markets. Unfair trade and pricing practices or subsidies may also lead to increased supply in certain markets, resulting in increased price competition. Trade tariffs and barriers could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Delinquent or non-collectible payments by our customers could adversely affect us.
Many of our customers have shared the financial and operational challenges faced by us during the dramatic recession that began in the fall of 2008 and the slow and uneven European and
35

global economic recovery that has followed. If economic conditions deteriorated, it could lead to financial difficulties or even bankruptcy filings by our customers. In consequence, our customers may not pay at all, or on untimely basis, for our products. In the future, we may experience a higher than normal level of delayed non-payments by our customers. Accordingly, the inability or limited ability of our customers to pay for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions.
We have operations in Sweden, Finland, Germany and other jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. European and other international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot be sure that these interpretations are accurate or that the responsible tax authority is in agreement with our views. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could cause us to have to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our products or services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results.
Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Because of inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of our internal controls in the future, nor can we assure you that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures will not deteriorate. We may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement or that constitute material weaknesses. A material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Any failure to remediate any future material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or to implement and maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations, result in material misstatements in our financial statements, or could result in defaults under the Revolving Credit Facility or any Pension Insurance Line, the Indenture or any other debt instruments we may enter into in the future. Deficiencies in our internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.
Our compliance controls and procedures may not be sufficient to prevent or discover violations of anti-corruption and anti-fraud laws or group-wide policies.
We are exposed to the risks of corruption and fraud both internally and externally. Our operations are large in scale, which may make fraudulent or accidental transactions difficult to detect. In addition, some countries in which we operate are rated by NGOs, such as Transparency International as having a high level of corruption and related practices, including acceptance of kickbacks, bribes, facilitation payments or other illegal gains or benefits by customers or authorities. While we have a code of conduct and other compliance measures to prevent any unlawful activities, the code of conduct and other internal policies and procedures may not be sufficient to protect against corrupt or fraudulent activities. In addition, we may not always be able to detect corrupt or unethical practices by employees or agents. If our employees or our agents violate applicable anti-corruption laws or similar rules relating to the aforementioned practices, we may be required to pay damages or fines and could risk losing necessary licenses. Additionally, the involvement of our employees or our agents in fraudulent or corrupt practices
36

could harm our reputation and lead to the loss of customers. Any such event occurring could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Our IT systems and networks may be subject to security threats and sophisticated computer crime.
We rely upon IT systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities. In addition, we collect and store sensitive data. In the event the our IT systems becomes unusable or are significantly impaired for any reason during an extended period of time, our operations may be adversely affected since the manufacturing process as well as the ability to deliver products at the appointed time, order raw materials and handle inventory are largely dependent on our IT systems. Difficulties in maintaining, upgrading and integrating these systems may result in damage to our reputation, increased costs, and reduced profitability. In addition, any problems with IT systems could result in leakage of sensitive information, theft of intellectual property and unavailability of production systems, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In recent years, there has been an increase in both the number and sophistication of IT security threats and computer crimes in the general business world though not at Ovako. These IT security threats and increasingly sophisticated computer crimes, including advanced persistent threats, pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Although we have taken, and intend to continue to take, what we believe are appropriate and reasonable steps to prevent security breaches in our systems and networks, a failure of or breach in security could expose us to risks of production downtimes and operations disruptions, misuse of information or systems, or the compromising of confidential information, which in turn could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Our reputation is one of our key assets and if that reputation is harmed, our business and results of operations may suffer.
We are exposed to the risk of negative publicity, press speculation and threatened or actual legal proceedings concerning our business, which may harm our reputation. Any damage to our reputation could cause existing customers to terminate their relationship with us or prevent us from winning new contracts. Any of these negative effects could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Risks relating to an investment in the Notes and the Guarantees
The Notes and each of the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to present and future liabilities of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.
Not all our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors and claims of preference shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by holders of the Notes under the Notes or the Guarantees. Accordingly, in the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, administration, reorganization or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding of any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our, the Issuer's or the applicable Guarantor's non-Guarantor subsidiaries.
37

The Guarantees and security interests on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.
The Indenture will provide that certain Guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law and enforcement of each Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. Additionally, in accordance with local laws, the Security Agent may not be able to represent the holders of the Notes in a court process without a specific power of attorney. See "Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on validity and enforceability o f the guarantees and security interests".
Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court could subordinate or void the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral granted by the relevant Security Documents and, if payment had already been made under a Guarantee or upon enforcement of the Collateral, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court found that:
 the relevant Guarantee or security interest under the Security Documents was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security;
 the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the relevant Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document and the Guarantor or security provider was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;
 the relevant Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objective of the Guarantor or security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider; or
 the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant Security Documents was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.
The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:
 the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets; 
 the present fair salable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or
 it cannot pay its debts as they become due.
If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance or held it unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under the Notes or such Guarantee are ineffective, or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or such Guarantee. In the event
38

of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of the other Guarantors under any Guarantees that have not been declared void.
Additionally, any future pledge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent, including pursuant to Security Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge, the pledge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within three months following the pledge, or in certain circumstances, a longer period.
In order to receive the benefit of a security interest, the secured creditors must hold secured claims (i.e., the secured party and the creditor have to be the same person).
In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted in the future to incur additional indebtedness and other obligations that may share in the liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the liens on the collateral securing our other secured debt. The granting of new security interests may require the releasing and retaking of security or otherwise create new hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and it may not be possible to enforce it.
Further, certain security documents governing security interests granted by the Guarantors will provide that the amounts guaranteed by such security interests will be limited to the extent of the amount guaranteed by such Guarantor. Therefore, limitations in the guarantees will also serve to limit the amounts guaranteed by the pledges of Collateral.
Further, the Guarantees and the Collateral, or the enforcement thereof, will be subject to certain contractual or other limitations or subordinated under German or other applicable law. The enforcement of the Guarantees and the Collateral will be limited to the extent that the granting of such Guarantees and the Collateral is not in the corporate interest of the relevant guarantor or provider of security, would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws or that the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees exceed the benefit to the relevant guarantor or provider of security. In particular, contractual limits may be applicable to certain Guarantees or Collateral to the extent the granting of such Guarantee or enforcement of relevant Collateral would result in a breach of capital maintenance rules or other statutory laws or would cause the directors of any Guarantor or provider of Collateral to contravene their duties to incur civil or criminal liability or to contravene any legal prohibition.
In addition, under German law, a secured party is obligated to release security if the value of the security is materially higher than the value of the obligations secured by such security. Consequently, the agreements governed by German law granting security will provide that the Security Agent will, upon the security grantor's request, release all or part of the security granted insofar as (i) the estimated aggregate value (De. Schatzwert) of the security exceeds, on a permanent basis, the secured obligations by more than 50% plus value added tax or (ii) if ascertainable, the realizable aggregate value (De. realisierbarer Wert) of such security exceeds, on a permanent basis, the secured obligations by more than 10% plus value added tax.
The insolvency laws of Sweden, Finland and Germany may not be as favorable to you as U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes.
The Issuer is a public limited liability company established under the laws of Sweden, and certain of the Guarantors are established under the laws of Sweden, Finland and Germany.
39

Consequently, in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors, insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer or the Guarantors would most likely be based on and governed by the insolvency laws of the jurisdiction under which the relevant entity is established. The insolvency laws of Sweden, Finland and Germany may be less favorable to your interests as creditor than the bankruptcy laws of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, particularly with respect to the priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings. The application of these laws, and any conflict between them, may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. See "Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on validity and enforceability o f the guarantees and security interests".
Enforcing your rights as a holder of Notes or under the Guarantees or security across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult.
The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Sweden and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated or organized under the laws of Sweden, Finland and Germany. The Collateral includes the shares of certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of these jurisdictions. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Sweden, Finland and Germany. Such multijurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The multijurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral. The validity of the Collateral may be subject to challenge and Collateral may be set aside in insolvency proceedings. See "Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on validity and enforceability o f the guarantees and security interests".
Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent priority in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Agent and holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral. See "Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on validity and enforceability o f the guarantees and security interests".
You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations.
The Issuer is organized under the laws of Sweden and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Sweden, Finland and Germany. Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantors have assets in the United States, except for the shares in the subsidiary Ovako North America Inc. Some or all of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer may be non-residents of the United States and many of their assets will be located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or its directors and executive officers, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws. In addition, the Issuer cannot assure investors that civil liabilities predicated upon federal securities laws of the United States will be enforceable in Sweden. See "Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on validity and enforceability o f the guarantees and security interests".
The rights of the holders of the Notes to take enforcement action, including with respect to the liens securing the Notes, are limited and subject to collateral sharing arrangements.
The security interest in our assets serving as Collateral for the Notes and the Guarantees thereof will also be granted as collateral in favor of the lenders under any Pension Insurance Line, the
40

Revolving Credit Facility (and in certain circumstances, facilities that refinance the Revolving Credit Facility) and certain hedging counterparties. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture will also permit a security interest in such Collateral to be granted to lenders of additional debt and to hedging counterparties under certain of our hedging obligations. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will also serve as the Security Agent for the lenders under any Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility (and any applicable refinancing thereof), any additional secured debt and for certain hedge counterparties will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. In general, the lenders and the agent under any Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility and the representatives of our hedging counterparties and any agent with respect to any future secured debt will have, subject to prior notification of and consultation with the Trustee, the right to instruct the Security Agent to enforce the shared collateral. In addition, holders of the Notes will not be able to force a sale of the Collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the Security Documents without consulting the lenders and agents under any Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility (and any applicable refinancing thereof), certain hedge counterparties and any such other secured debt for so long as any amounts under any Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility (and any applicable refinancing thereof), certain hedging obligations or such other secured debt remain outstanding or as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the enforcement sale of any Collateral (or other sale of Collateral following a Distress Event) will be subject to, as a condition to the release of any claims of any other debt secured by such Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections intended to maximize the secured creditors' recovery from an enforcement sale. Prior to enforcement of the Collateral by any class of creditors, the other classes of creditors will be provided with notice and the delivery of any enforcement proposal will commence a 30-day consultation period (or such shorter period as may be agreed). Neither the Trustee, the Issuer nor the holders of the Notes will have the ability to prevent or delay enforcement after the relevant consultation periods have expired and, if required by the Intercreditor Agreement, consultation has occurred.
The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that a common security agent, who will also serve as the security agent for the lenders under any Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility (and any applicable refinancing thereof), our hedging obligations and any additional debt secured by the Collateral permitted to be incurred by the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement will regulate the ability of the Trustee or holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent will not be required to take enforcement action unless following the consultation period referred to above, it has received instructions from (i) creditors holding a majority of the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Notes, the non-priority hedging obligations and certain secured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes (the "Majority Senior Creditors"), (ii) if no such instructions have been received by Majority Senior Creditors at the expiration of the consultation period, the creditors holding more than 66 2/3% of the aggregate amount of indebtedness and commitments outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the priority hedging obligations (the "Majority Super Senior Creditors") and (iii) if no such instructions have been received from either the Majority Senior Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors at the expiration of the consultation period, the creditors holding more than 66 2/3% of the aggregate amount of indebtedness and commitments outstanding under the Pension Insurance Line, in each case acting through their respective creditor representative.
Although enforcement instructions given by the holders of the Notes (to the extent such holders hold a majority of the aggregate principal amount owed under the Notes, certain additional debt secured by the Collateral and certain hedging obligations) will prevail after such consultation period (other than in the case that it is determined, acting reasonably, that such delay would have a material adverse effect of the ability to enforce on the realization proceeds), if the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility (and any applicable refinancing thereof) and certain hedging obligations have not been fully discharged within six months of the date the first
41

such enforcement instruction was issued or if no steps have been taken in relation to the commencement of enforcement of the Collateral within three months after the date of such enforcement instruction (including any instruction not to take enforcement steps) then enforcement instructions by the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (and any applicable refinancing thereof) and creditors under certain hedging liabilities will prevail, and if the liabilities under any Pension Insurance Line have not been fully discharged within 12 months of the date the first such enforcement instruction was issued or if no steps have been taken in relation to the commencement of enforcement of the Collateral within six months after the date of such enforcement instruction, then enforcement instructions by the lenders under the Pension Insurance Line will prevail. These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a number of respects and may permit the lenders under any Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility (and any applicable refinancing thereof) and creditors under certain hedging liabilities to control enforcement in circumstances in which their interests are different from those of the holders of the Notes. See "Description o f other indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement". The lenders under any Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility (and any applicable refinancing thereof), certain hedge counterparties or any other future class of debt secured by the Collateral may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would not be advantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.
The value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes, and there may be limitations on your ability to foreclose on the Collateral.
The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by security interests in the Collateral described in this offering memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations under any "super priority" credit facility, including any Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations. The holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral underlying their security interest. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Original Pension Insurance Line may be increased (or an Additional Pension Insurance Line may be put in place) up to an amount equal to our pension liabilities at the applicable time; any such increase will benefit from first-ranking, super senior security interest in the Collateral. The Revolving Credit Facility contains a mechanism under which commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased from EUR40 million to up to EUR50 million and any such increase will also benefit from first-ranking security interests in the Collateral. Upon a refinancing of the Revolving Credit Facility, or if the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility consent to an increase under the Revolving Credit Facility, the amount that will benefit from first-ranking security interest in the Collateral may be increased up to the amount provided under the Indenture. The Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Your rights to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the first-priority debt secured by the Collateral and if the value of the Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the other holders of the Notes together with the claims of other secured creditors, those claims may not be satisfied in full, or at all, before the claims of our unsecured creditors are paid.
The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, imperfections, encumbrances and other liens permitted under the Indenture. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, imperfections, encumbrances and other liens could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on that Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the
42

consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.
No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been prepared by us or on our behalf for the Offering. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon a sale of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the general prevailing market, the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of suitable buyers at the time of sale. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid by nature and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, the share pledges of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. Consequently, liquidating the Collateral may not result in proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due under the Notes after satisfying the obligations to pay any creditors with prior liens. If the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer's and the Guarantors' remaining assets, which may not be sufficient to repay our obligations under the Notes.
Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in certain Collateral.
In some jurisdictions, under applicable law a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can be properly perfected, and its priority retained, only through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security. For any security to be validly created under Swedish law, the security provider must also be effectively deprived of its rights to dispose of or deal with the assets which are the subject of the security. The liens in the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions we are, or the Security Agent is, as the case may be, required to take to perfect or maintain the perfection of any of these liens. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and identified.
The Trustee and the Security Agent for the Notes are under no obligation to monitor, and we may not comply with our obligations to inform the Trustee or Security Agent of, any future acquisition of property and rights by us, and the necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired property or rights. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the security interest in the Collateral or adversely affect the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent for the Notes has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights by us or the perfection of or to take any steps to perfect any security interest.
As a general rule, a security interest over Collateral cannot be validly created, if the relevant security provider is not the owner of the relevant Collateral. In some jurisdictions, it cannot be ascertained from public registers as to whether the presumed security provider actually owns the relevant Collateral (e.g. in case of receivables governed by German law or moveable assets located in Germany where no such registers exist). Applicable laws of some jurisdictions may even not allow for a bona fide acquisition of a security interest in certain Collateral (e.g. in case of receivables under German law which cannot be acquired bona fide).
In addition, the unperfected pledge of intra-group receivables (granted by each of the Issuer, Ovako Sweden AB and Ovako Bright Bar AB) and of dividends under the Security Documents governed by Swedish law will provide the Security Agent a right to create a security interest over
43

intra-group receivables (granted by each of the Issuer, Ovako Sweden AB and Ovako Bright Bar AB) and dividends, but such security interest will only be perfected when (i) in relation to dividends, the relevant company is duly notified that dividends may not be paid to the pledgor and (ii) in relation to intra-group receivables (granted by each of the Issuer, Ovako Sweden AB and Ovako Bright Bar AB), when the relevant debtor is duly notified that payment of principal and interest may not be paid to the pledgor. Until such notification is made, the pledge of intra-group receivables (of each of the Issuer, Ovako Sweden AB and Ovako Bright Bar AB) and dividends under Security Documents governed by Swedish law will remain unperfected, and there can be no assurance that the Security Agent will timely make any such notification even though it may be obligated to do so. It should also be noted that in accordance with terms of certain Finnish Security Agreements, the security providers are not required to perfect the Collateral in relation to all security assets (such as dividends and bank accounts) before the occurrence of an acceleration event. This may prejudice the effectiveness of such Collateral until such Collateral is duly perfected, and the Collateral may still be subject to recovery risk in any insolvency proceeding thereafter.
The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes, and the holders of the Notes will have limited rights to enforce remedies under the Security Documents.
The security interests in the Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes, but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent (and/or in favor of the secured parties represented by the Security Agent acting for and on their behalf). The Trustee will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement with, among others, the Security Agent and representatives of the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral, including the Revolving Credit Facility and the Original Pension Insurance Line. Other creditors, including the parties to any Additional Insurance Line Agreement, may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement in the future. Among other things, the Intercreditor Agreement governs the enforcement of the Security Documents, the sharing in any recoveries from such enforcement and the release of the Collateral by the Security Agent. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Security Agent, who will follow instructions as set forth under "Description o f other indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement".
It is generally possible under Swedish law to grant security interests in favor of an agent acting on behalf of secured parties. However, to enable the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral on behalf of the holders of the Notes in a Swedish court, the Security Agent may need a specific power of attorney from each holder of the Notes. It has not been established by judicial precedent or otherwise by law that a power of attorney or mandate of agency, including the appointment of an agent can be made irrevocable. Therefore, any powers of attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the party giving such powers. In addition, the failure of all holders of the Notes to submit such a power of attorney could negatively affect the enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral.
In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a Security Document will be validly secured.
In certain jurisdictions, including, among others, Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the respective Collateral will secure a so-called "parallel debt" obligation (the "Parallel Debt Obligation") created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent as well as, or in lieu of, securing the obligations under the Notes directly. This parallel debt structure is used where certain jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the
44

creation and ongoing valid existence of security interests which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such as novation, may cause invalidity of the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the "Principal Obligations"), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the parallel debt structure has not been tested in court in these jurisdictions and there is no judicial guidance as to its efficacy. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.
Security over the assets of a company through a Swedish law business mortgage is only a "passive" security.
A Swedish business mortgage will essentially cover inventory, machinery, receivables, intellectual property rights and other claims owned by a Swedish company. It does not cover real property, cash and bank deposits, shares and other financial instruments intended for public trading, property that can be subject to a mortgage or property that cannot be seized or that cannot form part of a bankruptcy estate. A business mortgage provides security over the assets covered by the business mortgage up to a maximum amount equal to the lower of (i) the secured claim and (ii) 115% of the face amount of the business mortgage certificate plus interest on such amount from the date of the bankruptcy application at a rate corresponding to the official reference rate plus 4%.
Until a seizure or bankruptcy occurs, a company that has provided a business mortgage is free to deal with the assets covered by the business mortgage. Thus, if any of our assets are sold, the business mortgage over such assets will seize to be valid. Furthermore, special priority rights with a higher ranking than a business mortgage (such as a possessory pledge) may be attached to or granted by us over assets covered by the business mortgage. If this is done, such priority rights will give a better priority to these assets and the proceeds from a sale of such assets in a bankruptcy.
The business mortgage certificates are bearer instruments and must be kept by the Security Agent to maintain the perfection and validity of the security interest. A business mortgage cannot be enforced by the mortgagee but will give the mortgagee a priority (as described above) to the proceeds from a sale of the assets covered by the business mortgage after a seizure of such assets or by the bankruptcy administrator in a bankruptcy.
A mortgage over real property in Sweden is limited in value and can only be enforced through public proceedings.
A mortgage over real property in Sweden will cover the relevant land unit plus certain fixtures and fittings. Depending on whether a special filing has been made, the real property may include also certain industrial fixtures and fittings. A mortgage over real property provides security over the land unit (including certain fixtures and fittings) up to a maximum amount equal to the lower of (i) the secured claim and (ii) 115% of the face amount of the mortgage certificate plus interest on such amount from the date of enforcement at a rate corresponding to the official reference rate plus 4%. The amount of the mortgage certificate is not tied to the value of the real property and may be higher than the market value of a property. The mortgage certificates are bearer instruments and must be kept by the Security Agent to maintain the perfection and validity of the security interest.
A court can declare that the claim of a mortgagee shall have "special priority" in the real property in question. In such case, the real property is considered to be seized immediately. The mortgagee could also obtain an enforceable judgment from a court and thereafter demand seizure of the unit of real property. After the real property has been seized, it will be sold by the local enforcement authority at an advertised public auction. If the enforcement authority deems
45

it to be more favorable, the property may instead be sold by the enforcement authority in a private sale, provided that it is clear what the claims and the other rights pertaining to the real property are. If the mortgagor has been declared bankrupt, the bankruptcy administrator may demand that a real property which belongs to the bankruptcy estate is sold at an auction. The bankruptcy administrator may, however, sell the real property in another manner if this is deemed to be more favorable for the bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy administrator will distribute the funds from the sale to the mortgagor up to the secured amount and thereafter to unsecured creditors. It is not possible for a mortgagee to enforce a mortgage over real property in any manner other than as described.
Any costs associated with the disposal and incurred by the Enforcement Authority will however have priority ahead of the secured creditors and any costs must be recovered before a distribution to the creditors may be made. Any surplus from the sale (i.e. to the extent sale proceeds exceed the total amount of the mortgage certificates) must be paid to the relevant pledgor or its bankruptcy estate. The enforcement authority has broadly defined statutory powers in connection with the enforcement of mortgage certificates and may reject a disposal if a potentially higher bid can be achieved at a subsequent auction or private sale. As a consequence, the Security Agent will have less control over the enforcement process than they would have had if enforcement had been made in respect of the shares in the property-owning company.
The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the operation of the business or sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes.
Subject to the certain limitations set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Original Pension Insurance Line and the Indenture, the Security Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, subject to limitations with respect to Security Documents governed by Swedish law, Finnish law or German law, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral, which could reduce the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the liens on the Notes.
To the extent that additional indebtedness and obligations are secured by the Collateral, our control over the Collateral may be diminished. To the extent these activities are allowed with regard to certain security interests, under Swedish law, Finnish law and German law, such security interests could be considered not validly perfected.
The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, the delayed perfection of security interest or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening periods, i.e., the periods of time following the granting of security interests during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.
The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Guarantees may create hardening periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture permits the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective
46

and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See "Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on validity and enforceability o f the guarantees and security interests". The same considerations also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.
In relation to the security over intra-group receivables (granted by each of the Issuer, Ovako Sweden AB and Ovako Bright Bar AB) and dividends under Security Documents governed by Swedish law certain bankruptcy limitations could apply under Swedish law. In particular, under the Bankruptcy Act (5w; konkurslagen (1987:672)), in a bankruptcy or in a company reconstruction where a composition among creditors has been approved by the court, any security granted may be recovered if (a) it was not provided for at the time the debt it secured arose or if it was not perfected without delay following the coming into existence of such debt, unless in the circumstances it was nevertheless ordinary, and (b) it was granted later than three months before the "relevant date" (broadly, the date when the petition for bankruptcy or company reconstruction was lodged). Such security may also be recovered if provided to a related party earlier than three months but later than two years before the relevant date, unless it can be shown that the debtor was not insolvent at the time of the action and did not become insolvent as a result of it.
There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the relevant Trustee.
Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released, including:
 upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes;
 upon release of the Guarantee (with respect to the liens securing such Guarantee granted by such Guarantor);
 in connection with a disposition of Collateral to any person other than the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture;
 if the Issuer designates any Guarantor to be an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and capital stock, of such unrestricted subsidiary;
 in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement; and
 in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
Even though holders of the Notes share in the Collateral securing the Notes ratably with the lenders under the Pension Insurance Line and the Revolving Credit Facility, under certain circumstances, the lenders under the Pension Insurance Line and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain of our hedging arrangements will control enforcement actions with respect to the Collateral through the Security Agent, whether or not holders of the Notes agree or disagree with those actions.
Under various circumstances, the Guarantees will be released automatically, including:
 upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes;
 upon a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a restricted subsidiary of the Issuer, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture;
47

 if the Issuer designates any restricted subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;
 upon the defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided under "Description o f Notes--Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance" or "Description of Notes--Satisfaction and discharge", as applicable;
 in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement; and
 in accordance with the other provisions of the Indenture.
See "Description o f other indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement".
The Collateral is subject to casualty risks.
We intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and customary for our business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss of any of the Collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured obligations, including the Notes and the Guarantees.
In the event of a total or partial loss to any of our facilities, certain items of equipment and inventory may not be easily replaced, if at all. Accordingly, even though there may be insurance coverage, the extended period needed to manufacture replacement units or inventory could cause significant delays and any such delay could further decrease the value of the other Collateral.
We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture.
Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a "change of control" as defined in the Indenture, the Issuer is required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, our ability to make such purchase may be limited by our then existing financial resources and we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Original Pension Insurance Line or our other then existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, the Original Pension Insurance Line or the Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our then existing financial resources. In addition, under the terms of the agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility and the Original Pension Insurance Line, under certain circumstances, if we repay more than EUR 90.0 million (plus the amount of any additional shareholder funding made for that purpose), or 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby, we are required to repay and cancel commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Original Pension Insurance Line in the same proportion. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to any of the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes.
48

In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, the Original Pension Insurance Line and certain other indebtedness. See "Description o f Notes--Repurchase at the option o f holders--Change o f control."
The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a "change of control" as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under "Description o f Notes--Repurchase at the option o f holders--Change o f control", the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.
The definition of "change of control" contained in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "all or substantially all," there is no precisely established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of "all or substantially all" of the Issuer's assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.
Furthermore, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under the Indenture will not be deemed to be a change of control if at the time our consolidated leverage ratio is less than certain specified levels. See "Description o f Notes-- Certain Definitions--Change o f Control".
Certain covenants may fall away upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings.
The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and a rating of BBB- or better from Standard & Poor's Investors Ratings Services and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time as the Notes cease to have investment-grade ratings from both Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Investors Ratings Services, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See "Description o f Notes--Certain covenants--Suspension o f covenants when Notes rated Investment Grade".
If these covenants were to be suspended, we would be able to incur additional indebtedness or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investmentgrade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.
You may face foreign exchange risks or adverse tax consequences by investing in the Notes denominated in foreign currencies.
The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a U.S. dollar or other non-euro investor, as applicable, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar or other relevant currencies due to economic, political or other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar or other relevant currencies could
49

cause a decrease in the effective yield of the relevant Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the relevant Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains, if any. See "Certain taxation considerations--Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations".
There is no established trading market for the Notes. If a market for the Notes does not develop, your ability to sell the Notes may be limited. The Notes are new issues of securities for which there is currently no established trading market. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market in the Notes, your ability to sell your Notes; or the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes. Although application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and for trading on the Euro MTF Market Luxembourg Stock Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed on that exchange. The Initial Purchasers of the Notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice.
The liquidity of the trading market in the Notes and the market price quoted for the Notes may be adversely affected by many factors, including, among other things, changes in the overall market for similar securities, interest rates, our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industry generally. Historically, the market for non-investmentgrade debt has been subject to substantial volatility, which could adversely affect the price at which you may sell your Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issue, the Notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our operating performance and other factors. As a result, an active trading market for the Notes may not develop or, if developed, may not continue, and you may be unable to sell your Notes.
Furthermore, it is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all. In addition, the Indenture will allow the Issuer to issue additional Notes in the future which could adversely impact the liquidity of the Notes offered hereby.
The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies. The Notes will initially only be issued in global form and held by, or on behalf of, a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.
50

Interests in the global notes will trade in book-entry form only, and the Notes in definitive registered form ("definitive registered notes"), will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners of the Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to Elavon Financial Services Limited, UK Branch, as Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants' accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the Paying Agent for Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.
Unlike the registered holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable you to vote on a timely basis.
Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a bookentry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See "Book-entry, delivery and form".
The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may affect the value of the Notes.
The Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable laws. We have not undertaken any registration rights in respect of the Notes. You should read the discussions in "Plan o f distribution--Transfer restrictions" for further information about these and other transfer restrictions. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of Notes comply with applicable law.
Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time.
One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.
51

Risks relating to our structure and indebtedness
Other than providing management services, the Issuer is a holding company and depends on distributions from its subsidiaries to service and repay the Notes; certain covenants in our financing arrangements and other agreements may limit the availability of operating cash flow to the Issuer.
Other than providing management services, the Issuer is a holding company and conducts its operations principally through, and derives its revenues principally from, its subsidiaries. As such the Issuer will be dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to make timely payments under the Proceeds Loans and other loans and distributions. The ability of the Issuer's subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments to the Issuer will be subject to the availability of profits or funds for such purpose which, in turn, will depend on the future performance of the subsidiary concerned which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond its control. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the making of such distributions contained in its financing arrangements and in applicable laws and regulations. Although security will be granted over the receivables under the Proceeds Loans to secure the Notes and the Guarantees, you should only rely on the Guarantees and the other liens in favor of the Notes and the Guarantees to provide credit support in respect of payments of principal or interest on the Notes as the Proceeds Loans and certain other intercompany loans may be amended in certain circumstances. The terms of the Proceeds Loans do not prevent the borrower thereunder from prepaying loan amounts or offsetting them against certain other claims. As a result, the initial amounts of the Proceeds Loans may be reduced prior to the maturity of the Notes. See "Description of other indebtedness". There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that alternative sources of financing will be available at any time in an amount sufficient to enable these subsidiaries to service their indebtedness, to fund their other liquidity needs and to make payments to the Issuer sufficient to allow all payment obligations under the Notes to be met.
Our significant leverage and debt service obligations may make it difficult for us to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and operate our business.
Upon the consummation of the Refinancing, we will have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness with significant debt service requirements. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Refinancing, our total indebtedness (including the Notes) would have been EUR300.3 million as of March 31, 2014.
Our significant leverage could have important consequences for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:
 making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and liabilities;
 requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt instead of operations, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, and other general corporate purposes;
 increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, a downturn in our business, or generally adverse economic or industry conditions;
 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged as us;
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and industry;
 restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;
52

 limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries' ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings;
 exposing us to risks that are inherent in interest rate fluctuations because certain of our indebtedness bears variable rates of interest; and
 subjecting us to restrictive covenants, including, in the case of our Revolving Credit Facility, financial covenants, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, our indebtedness.
We primarily expect to use cash flow from operations and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to finance our operations, service our indebtedness and fund capital expenditures. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in us being unable to service or repay indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet our other obligations and commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose. We cannot assure you that such refinancing or asset disposals could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments.
Despite our high level of indebtedness and restrictive covenants, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt or make certain restricted payments, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.
We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including any Additional Pension Insurance Line or other additional secured indebtedness, in the future. Although the Indenture and the agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility and the Original Pension Insurance Line will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness (including secured indebtedness) that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Following this Refinancing, we expect to have EUR40 million immediately available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the Indenture, in addition to specified permitted debt, we will be able to incur additional indebtedness so long as on a pro forma basis our fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Indenture) is at least 2.0 to 1.0 and additional indebtedness sharing in the Collateral securing the Notes so long as on a pro forma basis our consolidated senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in the Indenture) is no greater than 3.5 to 1.0. In addition, neither the Indenture nor the agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility and Original Pension Insurance Line will prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future could be effectively and structurally senior to the Notes and may be secured by collateral that does not secure the Notes. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks described in this offering memorandum. If we are able to designate some of our restricted subsidiaries under the Indenture as unrestricted subsidiaries, those unrestricted subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow beyond the limitations specified in the Indenture and engage in other activities in which restricted subsidiaries may not engage. We are also permitted to invest in joint ventures and acquisitions, which may increase our indebtedness. Moreover, although the Indenture and the agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility and Original Pension Insurance Line will contain restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends, we will be able to make substantial restricted payments under certain circumstances. Adding new debt to our and our subsidiaries' existing debt levels or making restricted payments could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage described above, including our possible inability to service our debt.
53

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.
Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Some of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in our debt agreements, including the Indenture, and other agreements we may enter into in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make interest and principal payments on our debt, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.
If our cash flows from operations and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, forego opportunities, or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not be sufficient to enable us to meet our scheduled debt obligations. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be required to sell material assets to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we receive may not be adequate to meet any debt obligations then due. If we cannot meet our debt obligations, the holders of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets securing such debt. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.
In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see "Management's discussion and analysis o f financial condition and results o f operations-- Results o f operations--Liquidity and capital resources".
We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to raise additional funds.
The Indenture and the agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility contain covenants that significantly restrict our ability to:
 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;
 incur or permit to exist certain liens;
 make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to capital stock;
 prepay or redeem subordinated debt or capital stock;
 make certain loans or other investments;
 create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to, and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries;
 sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;
 engage in certain transactions with affiliates;
 issue or sell the share capital of certain subsidiaries;
 consummate a change of control;
54

 consolidate or merge with other entities or sell substantially all of our assets; and
 impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.
Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. See "Description o f other indebtedness--Revolving Credit Facility" and "Description o f Notes-- Certain covenants". Despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants contained in the Indenture and the agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility and the Original Pension Insurance Line could materially affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions, raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise or grow in accordance with our strategy. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance our capital needs.
Additionally, our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will require us to maintain minimum Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) of EUR35 million, tested quarterly, and our ability to meet that financial test can be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. A breach of any of those covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under the agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, and the relevant lenders, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, could cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, and to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.
Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Pension Insurance Line, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale, or from the Collateral following a Distress Event in priority to the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not control decisions regarding the Collateral in certain circumstances.
The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured initially on a first-ranking basis by the same Collateral securing the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Original Pension Insurance Line and certain hedging liabilities. In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu or on a super-priority basis, including any Additional Pension Insurance Line, other future credit facilities and certain hedging liabilities.
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Pension Insurance Line, certain future credit facilities (subject to the incurrence of additional indebtedness permitted by the Indenture) and certain hedging liabilities will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale, or from the Collateral following a Distress Event, in priority to the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure on the Collateral, you may not be able to recover amounts owed to you if the then outstanding claims under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Pension Insurance Line, certain future credit facilities and such hedging obligations are greater than the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor, or from the Collateral following a Distress Event, will, after all obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Pension Insurance Line, future credit facilities benefitting from such ranking and such hedging obligations have been
55

discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral which are permitted to rank pari passu with the Notes.
The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Pension Insurance Line, certain future credit facilities and creditors in respect of certain hedging obligations may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.
In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of our subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Guarantees and the liens over any assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See "Description o f other indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement" and "Description o f Notes--Security--Release".
Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Pension Insurance Line or the Indenture, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
The Revolving Credit Facility, the Original Pension Insurance Line and the Indenture require us to comply with various covenants, including any financial covenant in the Revolving Credit Facility requiring us to satisfy specified financial tests.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain a minimum Consolidated EBITDA (as defined therein). See "Description o f other indebtedness--Revolving Credit Facility". Our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests could be affected by a deterioration in our results of operations, as well as by events beyond our control, including decreases in tariffs and unfavorable economic conditions, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those tests. Moreover, the Original Pension Insurance Line and the Revolving Credit Facility includes certain events of default (such as breach of representations and warranties and cross-payment defaults) that are in addition to the events of default set forth in the Indenture. If an event of default occurs under the Original Pension Insurance Line or the Revolving Credit Facility or any other of our debt instruments and is not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt could terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under other debt instruments, including the Notes, that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand. In these circumstances, our assets and cash flows may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness, including the Notes then outstanding, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we might not be able to repay our obligations under the Notes in such an event.
The Issuer and the Guarantors may be subject to mandatory liquidation due to capital deficiency.
As at the date of this offering memorandum, the registered share capital of the Issuer is EUR60,000. The Issuer is a company established under the laws of Sweden, limited by shares and is as such subject to the rules on mandatory liquidation due to capital deficiency in the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)). These rules prescribe that the board of directors shall immediately prepare and cause the company's auditors to examine a special balance sheet for liquidation purposes if (i) there is reason to believe that the shareholders' equity (assets minus liabilities), as would be shown by such special balance sheet, is less than one half of the registered share capital or (ii) in conjunction with execution pursuant to chapter 4 of the Enforcement of Judgment Code (Sw. utskningsbalken), it is shown that the company lacks attachable assets. Where the balance sheet for liquidation purposes shows that the company's shareholders' equity is less than half of the registered share capital, the board of directors shall, as soon as possible, issue notice to attend a general meeting which shall consider whether the
56

company shall go into liquidation (initial meeting for liquidation purposes). Where the balance sheet for liquidation purposes presented at the initial meeting for liquidation purposes fails to show that, on the date of such meeting, shareholders' equity amounted to at least the registered share capital and the general meeting has not resolved that the company shall go into liquidation, the general meeting shall, within a certain period of time (normally eight months) of the initial meeting for liquidation purposes, reconsider the issue whether the company shall go into liquidation (second meeting for liquidation purposes). If the shareholders' equity due to loss-making operations or a decline in asset value is reduced to less than EUR30,000, the Issuer will have to restore the shareholders' equity to at least EUR60,000 or suffer mandatory liquidation as described above. The shareholders' equity can be restored by a capital contribution from the shareholder or through a conversion of shareholders loan to equity through a shareholders' contribution (Sw. aktieagartillskott).
57

Use of proceeds

The gross proceeds from the issuance of the Notes will be EUR300.0 million. We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes will amount to approximately EUR292.3 million, after payment of the estimated commissions and other expenses related to the Offering of the Notes. The Issuer will use the proceeds from the Offering to (i) repay the amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities, (ii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Refinancing and (iii) for general corporate purposes.

On or about the Issue Date, we will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will provide for a Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of EUR40.0 million. On the Issue Date, the Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be undrawn. We expect to roll over into the Revolving Credit Facility from our Senior Credit Facilities an overdraft facility for approximately EUR10 million and approximately EUR2.5 million in bank guarantees.

The table below sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Refinancing. Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including differences from the estimates of outstanding amounts of existing indebtedness to be repaid on the Issue Date, the estimated amount of cash of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries as of the Issue Date, as well as the differences between estimated and actual fees and expenses.

In addition, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement provided for a pension guarantee facility which was undrawn. This will be replaced by the Original Pension Insurance Line we intend to enter into on our about the Issue Date. The principal amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities to be repaid are based on the amounts outstanding thereunder on March 31, 2014 and exclude any accrued interest between March 31, 2014 and the date hereof and breakage costs. See "Description o f other indebtedness-- Other indebtedness to be repaid in connection with the transaction."

Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
The following discussion and analysis is based on our audited consolidated financial statements as o f and for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as o f and for the three month periods ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Our consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements.
You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the sections entitled "Summary consolidated financial and other data" and "Selected historical consolidated financial data" along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
This discussion includes forward-looking statements which, although based on assumptions we consider reasonable, are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual events or conditions to differ materially from those expressed or implied herein. See "Forward-looking statements" and "Risk factors" for a discussion o f the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements.
Overview
We are a leading European producer of engineering steel, with a focus on value add products for demanding engineering applications. We are headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, and have five main production facilities in Sweden and Finland, including three electric arc furnace ("EAF") melting facilities. We have three finishing facilities in France, Italy and the Netherlands and 15 sales offices across Europe and in the United States, Singapore and China.
We supply engineering steel products under our master brand "Ovako" and our five distinct product brands M-Steel, BQ-Steel, IQ-Steel, SZ-Steel and WR-Steel, which are based on leading application development, metallurgical expertise and production technology. We have more than 300 active feasible steel grades for making materials, of which 110 make up more than 80% of the volumes, across our three main production flows. Most of our sales volume can be categorized into our five product brands, which represent five types of engineering steel materials that we sell, each of which has its own specialized end uses. Our production facilities use these steel grades to produce more than 10,000 different hot-rolled or forged shapes for customers, 2,400 of which comprised approximately 80% of our volume in 2013.
We have a diversified client base with over 2,000 customers, many of which consist of long standing relationships with companies who are leaders in their end markets. We believe that one of the key benefits we offer our customers is working together with them to solve their particular engineering challenges. As our products are often specific to our customers' requirements we benefit from being the supplier through our customer's entire product cycle, which may be several years. Consequently we benefit from a high proportion of repeat customers, with approximately 97.5% of the volumes sold to our top 1,000 customers in 2013 purchased by repeat customers that had placed orders with us in 2012. We have had relationships with each of our top ten customers for at least nine years, seven of which we have had for more than 20 years. Our top ten customers represented 40% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. We supply our largest customer at several different assembly facilities across a number of different jurisdictions and end markets.
We operate in the engineering steel segment, a segment of the steel industry focused on mildly to highly alloyed steel. The engineering steel segment is a specialized sector within the broader general steel industry. Value is added to our products by providing them with specific qualities requested by clients. We produce engineering steel products for four main end markets: automotive and transportation, other engineering, mining and oil & gas, and energy production.
62

The automotive and transportation and other engineering markets are our largest end markets, which we estimate accounted for approximately 40% and 30% of our total net sales in 2013, respectively. Our main geographic markets are Western Europe and the Nordics (Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway). In 2013, Western Europe (excluding the Nordics) and the Nordics accounted for 44.5% and 39.3%, respectively, of our total net sales, with Sweden and Germany together accounting for 52.1% of our total net sales.
We have been owned by Triton since 2010, during which time we have successfully managed through the recent market downturn in Europe. During the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, we generated total revenue of EUR875.6 million and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (as defined herein) of EUR74.0 million and sold 709 kt of steel. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we had an average of 3,001 full time equivalent employees worldwide.

Key factors affecting our results of operations
We believe that the factors discussed below are principal factors materially affecting our results of operations.

Volume of products sold

Sales volume is the most important driver of our results of operations. Historically, sales volume has fluctuated significantly, primarily due to the cyclical demand for engineering steel products.

The following table sets forth our sales volume in each of the periods indicated.

Notes:
(1) Sales volume presented in this table excludes the operations of our former wire division operations, which were not acquired by Triton as part of the acquisition in August 2010.
Sales volume is the key driver for our production levels. Each year we have a certain amount of fixed costs, in particular employee costs and costs for repairs and maintenance. Our results of operations are impacted by our ability to operate our production plants at levels at or near the capacity of our current manning level. We define capacity in general in relation to the number of shifts that we operate as our equipment may enable greater production levels if we added additional shifts. High levels of production are important because they enable us to spread our fixed costs over a greater number of tons. However, each year we plan production stops during certain weeks in July, August and December. Any significant decreases in tons of engineering steel we produce and sell therefore have an impact on our profitability. During the period under review, we have responded to reductions in demand by reducing capacity through reductions of production shifts at our steel mills and flexible work time arrangements in Sweden and Finland, which has allowed us to reduce fixed costs.
In the past, various types of factors have impacted the volumes we were able to produce and sell. Prior to 2009, the European engineering steel industry benefited from insufficient capacity for production of machinery and equipment in Asia, which led to a significant increase in demand for the products of our European customers and therefore fuelled European demand for engineering steel, which was a key driver for the historical highs of our sales volume in 2006 and 2007. Despite the recent recovery of economic conditions, we do not believe that demand from Asia will reach pre-2009 levels as local production capacity in Asia has increased, which also partially substitutes the capacity required by our European customers, making it unlikely that such demand pressure will reoccur in Europe.

63

Production closures at our facilities also impact the volume of engineering steel that we can produce. For example, in 2012 and 2013, production closures due to fires at our steel mill in Imatra in Finland resulted in a closure of five weeks and six weeks, respectively, and therefore also contributed to the decrease in sales volume during these periods. Since the closure in 2013, or steel mill in Imatra has remained open for normal production.
Cyclical demand as a result of changing economic conditions and conditions in our customers' markets
General. The market for engineering steel is cyclical in nature. Demand for engineering steel products is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions and generally driven by GDP and industrial production growth, which are significant drivers of the markets in which our customers operate, in particular the automotive and transportation, other engineering, mining, oil & gas and energy production industries.
Engineering steel industry. The engineering steel industry experienced a sharp fall in demand resulting from the economic crisis in late 2008 and 2009, which demonstrated the vulnerability of the engineering steel industry to volatility and sharp corrections. Beginning in the third quarter of 2008 and for much of 2009, the disruptions experienced by the global financial markets impacted industrial activity and consumer and government spending, which resulted in a large slump in demand, as consumers of engineering steel used up existing inventories and decreased purchases of new stock and, accordingly, the demand for engineering steel products decreased beyond that of cyclical fluctuations in GDP or industrial production. Producers of engineering steel, which are at the beginning of the engineered products value chain, were most affected by the reduction of stocks, as parties all along the value chain reduced their inventories, thereby aggravating the effects on the engineering steel producers. These factors significantly reduced the demand for the engineering steel products we produce, resulting in our sales volume decreasing by more than half, from 989 kt in 2008 to 418 kt in 2009.
The downward trend in the industry continued until the second half of 2009, when demand for our products began to increase gradually in line with global economic activity. The positive trend continued throughout 2010 and 2011 due to the continued recovery from the crisis, which resulted in an increase in our sales volume to 851 kt in 2011, compared to 418 kt in 2009 and 720 kt in 2010. However, in the second half of 2011, the turbulence in the financial markets and the unresolved sovereign debt issues in Europe resulted in a drop in confidence regarding the economic outlook and expected GDP growth. The impact of these developments on demand for our products was exacerbated by reduced orders as a result of destocking. These factors led to a fall in demand for our products and a significant decrease in our sales volume to 694 kt in 2012.
The engineering steel market stabilized again in the second half of 2013, driven mainly by gradually increasing European consumption and exports of European-manufactured vehicles, machinery and other equipment to emerging countries. The improved market situation in the second half of 2013 was primarily due to an underlying demand for high-end engineering steel products. The Nordic market slightly underperformed the rest of Europe where Germany in particular showed good progress. According to OECD data, during the second quarter of 2013 the European automotive and manufacturing industries, on a monthly basis compared to the previous year, reported an increase in total production for the first time since 2011. This positive trend continued into the remainder of the year. As a result of higher production rates in Europe, our order inflow strengthened and we also experienced a positive trend in terms of volumes since September of 2013.
End markets. The engineering steel industry is highly dependent on the level of activity in the end markets in which our customers operate, in particular the automotive and transportation, other engineering, mining, oil & gas and energy production industries. We estimate that, excluding sales to distributors, the automotive and transportation end markets, other engineering, mining, oil & gas exploration and extraction equipment and energy production accounted for approximately 40%, 30%, 10% and 5% of our total net sales in 2013, respectively.
64

We estimate that the remaining 15% of our total net sales in 2013 were derived from distributors. We do not have estimates of the end-markets to which distributers sell our products but we believe that most of our products sold to distributers are purchased by customers in the other engineering industry and automotive and transportation industry.

Within the automotive and transportation sector, our exposure has been primarily to heavy trucks and construction equipment, which accounts for most of our revenue from the automotive and transportation sector, and to a lesser extent on passenger cars. Our results of operations have therefore been particularly affected by changes in the demand for trucks and construction equipment, which is more sensitive than demand for passenger cars to actual or expected changes in economic conditions generally and change in GDP specifically.

Our end markets are cyclical. We are dependent not only on general production volumes and the product mix of our customers (which impacts the amount and type of our products that go into the final product) but also on changes in product attributes required by our customers and our ability to develop new products. Due to our position at the beginning of the production value chain, the demand for our products is not only affected by a change in actual or expected demand for our customers' products, but also by our customers reducing their own stocks and inventories. As a result, in times of economic weakness or uncertainty we typically see a larger reduction in orders because our customers reduce their inventories. For example, in recent economic downturns, such as the economic crisis that began in late 2008, we experienced a larger decline in demand for our products than the decrease in the underlying demand for our customers' products. Similarly, in a period of recovery or expected recovery from an economic downturn, we typically experience a larger increase in demand for our products earlier than an increase in the underlying demand for our customers' products as our customers increase their inventory in anticipation of higher demand for their products. See also "Risk factors--Risks relating to our business and industry--We are significantly dependent on our customers' end markets, in particular the automotive and transportation, other engineering, mining, oil & gas exploration and extraction equipment and energy production end markets."

We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of our products, delivery performance and price. We sell a significant majority of our products to customers located in Europe. We depend on maintaining close geographical proximity between our mills and our customers because of the costs of transporting metals across large distances is high and because of the importance of close collaboration in engineering and flexible delivery times. See also "Risk factors--Risks relating to our business and industry--Our business could be disrupted if our customers shift either their manufacturing or sourcing requirements offshore."

Geographic markets. Our main geographic markets are Western Europe and the Nordics (Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway). In 2013, Western Europe (excluding the Nordics) and the Nordics accounted for 44.5% and 39.3%, respectively, of our total net sales. Based on net sales, our main geographic markets are Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Finland, which accounted for 71.4% of our total net sales in 2013. Sweden and Germany together accounted for 52.1% of our total net sales in 2013.

The following table presents a breakdown of net sales by geographic market for each of the periods indicated.

Due to our focus on Western Europe and the Nordics, our business is affected by macroeconomic conditions in Europe, and in particular the economies of Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Finland. See "Risk factors--Risks relating to our business and industry--The substantial majority o f our net sales are concentrated to Western Europe and the Nordics, in particular Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Finland. In addition, Eastern Europe is a significant market for us. An economic decline in Europe, generally, or in these countries, specifically, or a protracted period o f weak growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results o f operations."
Pricing of engineering steel products
Engineering steel products are some of the most technologically advanced and complex products in the steel industry and are often made-to-order and sold in smaller lot sizes, typically at higher margins than commodity steel products. Engineering steel products generally contain very precise levels of alloying elements and are sold to customers who require specific metallurgical properties and compliance with strict quality specifications.
Engineering steel sales prices typically include scrap and alloy surcharge clauses, effectively passing on the raw material price to customers. Prices for our engineering steel products generally include two components:
 Base price: the base price is negotiated with customers and depends mainly on market supply and demand and is typically adjusted at the beginning of each year for annual agreements.
 Scrap and alloy surcharge: this is a supplementary charge added by producers to the selling price of steel in order to offset price variation in raw materials. The scrap surcharge is based on an index price system for scrap. The actual amount of the surcharge is typically based on the average price of scrap during a contractually agreed reference period, which varies according to the contractually agreed date of delivery of our product to the customer, and varies depending on the type of product and the country where the product is being sold. The alloy surcharge is calculated using raw material prices quoted on certain exchanges, such as the LME, or is determined based on industry-wide statistics. Like the scrap surcharge, the actual amount of the surcharge is typically based on the average price of alloy during a contractually agreed reference period, which varies according to the contractually agreed date of delivery of our product to the customer, determined and varies depending on the type of product and the country where the product is being sold. Scrap and alloy surcharges are applied when prices are above a certain trigger point. This trigger point is generally sufficiently low such that movements in scrap and alloy prices are readily reflected by a change in the selling price per ton.
Our customer agreements specifying raw materials cost pass through typically allow us to adjust the reference period used for the determination of the scrap and alloy surcharge on a monthly basis. These frequent surcharge adjustments allow us to minimize the time lag for pass-through. The time it takes us to produce a product (our internal process time) is typically longer than the contractually agreed reference period used to determine the average scrap and alloy prices used for the sale of our products (contractually agreed surcharge reference period). Synchronizing our internal process time and the contractually agreed surcharge reference period is important because it allows us to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of scrap and alloy. More specifically, in periods of falling scrap and alloy prices and if the contractually agreed surcharge reference period is shorter than our internal process time, we may have to purchase scrap and alloy at higher costs that we may not be able to fully pass on to our customers.
We estimate that a majority of our sales volume in the year ended December 31, 2013 was subject to agreements that permit us to pass increases in scrap and alloy costs to our customers. The remaining sales volume is sold based on contracts which do not allow us to pass on increases of scrap and alloy prices to our customers. However, for these customers we manage our
66

exposure to fluctuations in scrap and alloy prices by making these sales on a monthly or quarterly basis, which allows us to set prices in accordance with our raw material costs at the time such contract is entered into.
For costs other than scrap and alloys, including energy, there is no surcharge clause and therefore no pass-through mechanism.
The base prices for our engineering steel products have been largely stable between 2011 and 2013. While our base prices decreased slightly in 2013, they increased slightly in 2012. Beyond raw materials prices, the sustainability of higher engineering steel prices will continue to depend on our customers' inventory levels as well as an increase in sustainable real demand for our customers' products, the timing of which we cannot predict.

Electricity, gas, fuel oil and other energy costs

Energy expenses accounted for 11.6%, 11.6% and 12.0% of our cost of goods sold in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our largest energy related expenses are for electricity, which accounted for 50.8% of our energy expenses in 2013. Electricity is mainly used for running the electric arc furnaces to melt the scrap and to heat treatment furnaces. In addition to electricity, we also consume liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas and fuel oil, which are also used to heat treatment furnaces. Our electricity requirements are directly related to the volumes we produce.

The following table presents a breakdown of our energy expenses for each of the periods indicated.

Energy expenses are affected by various factors, including the availability of supplies of particular sources of energy, energy prices and regulatory decisions. In particular, recently electricity prices have fluctuated significantly. Average spot prices in EUR per MWh for electricity on the NASDAQ OMX market were 47.1, 31.2 and 38.1 in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. In the first quarter of 2014, the average spot price for electricity on the NASDAQ OMX was EUR30.2 per MWh. Due to the Nordic winter, electricity prices during the winter are typically highest.
We generally purchase electricity in the spot market, primarily NASDAQ OMX. In addition, in 2011, we entered into an electricity supply agreement at a fixed price and for a fixed volume in Finland, which covered approximately 26% of our electricity demand in Finland in 2013. This supply agreement will expire in December 2015.
To mitigate price volatility that causes fluctuations in cash flows and earnings, we hedge portions of the variable price of electricity through separate hedges by entering into financial contracts, either bilaterally or over the NASDAQ OMX market.
We changed our electricity prices hedging policy in the spring of 2012. Under our new policy, we hedge the price of our anticipated electricity consumption in the coming 24 months. We hedge between 40% and 60% of our anticipated electricity consumption for the next 12 months and between 20% and 50% of our anticipated electricity consumption in the following 12 months. The hedging is done on a rolling quarterly basis utilizing quarterly forward contracts. Our new electricity prices hedging policy had a positive impact on our result of operations in 2013 because we benefited from lower electricity prices on the spot market as our previous hedge portfolio was phasing out (approximately 60% hedge level in 2013 from contracts under the old policy) as a result of our new policy.

67

At year-end 2013, our anticipated electricity consumption for 2014 and 2015 was hedged as follows (including the long-term supply agreement in Finland, which will expire in December 2015): 57% for 2014 and 38% for 2015. A rise of 10% in the price of electricity compared to the price at December 31, 2013 would have an impact on our comprehensive income, before tax, of EUR2.1 million, due to revaluation of the derivatives.
We generally enter into annual contracts for the supply of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas and fuel oil, which include a base price and an average monthly surcharge based on market prices. As a result, changes in market prices of LPG, natural gas and fuel oil are typically passed on to us. At present we do not hedge our gas and fuel oil costs.
Impact of currency exchange rate movements
We are exposed to currency risk because our reporting currency is the EUR, while a portion of our revenues and a large share of our expenses are denominated in other currencies. The greatest currency risk is linked to the SEK, primarily because a large part of our production costs are in SEK. In 2013, sales in EUR accounted for 61% of our total net sales, compared to 28% and 11% for SEK and other currencies (mainly GBP and US$), respectively. The underlying purchase prices of key raw materials, such as iron scrap and alloys, are set in global or European markets and the functional purchasing currency is thus US$ and EUR, even if the actual purchase price may be invoiced in SEK.
Appreciation of the SEK by 10% in relation to the EUR would have an estimated annualized negative impact on consolidated operating profit of EUR19.0 million based on 2013 sales volumes and not taking into account foreign exchange hedges. From time to time we may decide to hedge contractual net exposures from sales and purchases in currencies other than our base currency or trading currency to hedge margins. We were not party to any currency derivatives for most of 2013 but in November 2013 we signed a foreign exchange forward contract that hedges approximately 37% of our estimated net outflow in SEK during 2014, with a total value of approximately EUR75.0 million. Hedge accounting is applied and the currency derivatives are designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, where the initial gross flows in SEK amounting to a certain amount are hedged each month. See note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 for further information.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal trends when measured on a half yearly basis. Demand for engineering steel products typically declines during July and August as during these months many customers are working reduced shifts or have plant closures. In addition, our manufacturing plants traditionally close for maintenance in July and August and part of December of each year. Most of our maintenance and repair expenses are usually incurred during the second half of our financial year, especially during the summer and Christmas holiday seasons, which is generally the least disruptive time to have plants cease production while maintenance and repairs are undertaken. Customers may also reduce their inventories at the end of the year in connection with their year-end balance sheet planning, as happened in December 2011 and 2012, which could have an impact on our net sales. As a result, we generally operate at lower capacity in the second half of our financial year. In each such period, due to lower capacity utilization that we experience or due to our own plant shutdowns and maintenance that we perform during summer months, our overhead absorption may be reduced and our plants may run at less than optimal efficiencies. Our results of operations are therefore typically stronger during the first six months of each year than during the last six months of each year.
Inventory
Changes in inventories affect our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities. In line with the absorption costing method of accounting for costs associated with the manufacturing of our products, our costs for raw materials and employees are capitalized in work in progress and finished goods inventory and are expensed through our income statement
68

when the finished goods are sold. This means that in any year some of the costs associated with manufacturing our products will not flow through the income statement as an expense but will remain in our inventory accounts on our balance sheet. In periods of decreases in our sales volume as a result of decreasing demand for our products, we typically reduce our inventories, which has a positive impact on our cash flows from operating activities. However, a release of inventory also results in an expense of the fixed cost elements capitalized in work in progress and finished goods, which is shown separately as changes in inventories and work in progress within cost of goods sold, resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations. During periods when we build up our inventory, for example in response to increases in demand for our products, our cash flow is negatively impacted but our results from operations are positively impacted. In 2012, our inventories decreased significantly, which was attributable to both the significant decrease in our sales volume in 2012 and our decision to actively manage our working capital. This contributed to a significant cash inflow but had a negative impact on our results of operations. The impact of changes in our inventories in 2013 was less significant, reflecting a lower decrease in sales volume compared to 2012 and inventory build up in the second half of the year reflecting increased demand for our products. In the first quarter of 2014, inventory volumes increased compared to the corresponding quarter of 2013, reflecting increased sales volume and higher production. Due to lower raw material prices in the first quarter of 2014, the value of our inventories on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2014 is slightly below the value of our inventories as of March 31, 2013.
Product mix
We produce hundreds of grades of materials, with a wide range of pricing and profit levels depending on the grade, shape and further processing applied to the product. As is common for our industry, the relative demand for particular products, or "product mix", can therefore also affect our results of operations. In addition, our product mix within a period is subject to the fluctuating order patterns of our customers as well as decisions we may make on participation in certain products based on available capacity. Over time the impact of our product mix may fluctuate and period-to-period comparisons may vary.
Initiatives taken in response to unfavorable economic conditions
In 2011, we launched several initiatives to reduce our cost structure. These initiatives targeted both our fixed costs, which we define as our employee benefit expenses and other operating costs (costs for repairs and maintenance, external services and other operating costs) and variable costs, which we define as costs for raw materials, energy costs, costs for supplies, freight and other distribution costs and changes in inventories and work in progress. As a result of our cost reduction initiatives, on a constant currency basis, our fixed costs decreased by EUR22.0 million, or 6.8%, from EUR325.0 million in 2011 to EUR303.0 million in 2013. This decrease was partly driven by our headcount reductions from 3,239 as of December 31, 2011 to 2,995 as of December 31, 2013, as production shifts at our steel mills were reduced and flexible work time agreements in Sweden and Finland were implemented. Our variable costs have decreased primarily as a result of reduced energy costs due to our new electricity price hedging policy, reduced transportation costs as a result of renegotiated transportation agreements in Eastern Europe and centralization and optimization of purchasing of supplies.
Principal income statement items
The following is a brief description of the most significant line items that are included in our consolidated income statement. For more information, see the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
Net sales. Revenue comprises the sale of goods within our normal operating activities and is recognized when the seller has transferred to the buyer the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration that has been or will be received, less VAT, discounts and returns.
69

Cost o f goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes all costs directly attributable to our manufacturing activities, mainly costs for raw materials, employees involved in our manufacturing activities (including salaries, benefits, pension expenses and social insurance fees), energy (mainly electricity, gas and fuel oil), supplies (mainly refractories, spare and replacement machine parts and tools), freight and other distribution costs, and other operating costs. Our other operating costs relate primarily to the repair and maintenance of our production equipment and production facilities, trucks, third-party handling of raw materials, third-party service agreements for machinery and equipment and other items such as production floor gear, personal safety equipment and healthcare insurance. Costs of goods sold also includes depreciation, amortization and impairments and changes in inventories and work in progress. Selling expenses. Selling expenses mainly include costs for sales and marketing personnel, including salaries, benefits, pension expenses and social insurance fees. In addition, selling expenses include other operating costs directly associated with our selling and marketing activities, including rent for premises used for sales and marketing activities, sales and marketing materials and travel related expenses. Administrative expenses. Administrative expenses mainly relate to costs for management and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, pension expenses and social insurance fees. In addition, administrative expenses include other operating costs directly attributable to our management and administrative activities, including professional services provided by thirdparties, service agreements and licenses. Other operating income. Other operating income includes revenues from operations that are not derived from normal business activities, such as rent, insurance payments and gains on the sale of fixed assets. Other operating income is recognized when it is probable that we will receive the economic benefits of the transaction and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Financial income. Financial income includes interest income arising from receivables and dividend income arising from available-for-sale assets. Financial costs. Financial costs includes interest expenses (including interest expenses for financial liabilities at amortized cost, prepaid finance charges, interest expenses in relation to our pension liability and interest expenses in relation to our interest rate derivatives) and other finance costs (including costs for loan commitments and guarantees, realized and unrealized exchange gains and losses from financial assets and liabilities, and other finance costs). Taxes. Tax expense (credit) represents the amount of income taxes payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (loss) and changes in deferred tax relating to temporary differences between tax and book income.

Net sales. Net sales in the first quarter of 2014 increased by EUR25.7 million, or 11.7%, from EUR220.2 million in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR245.9 million in the first quarter of 2014. The increase in our net sales in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013 was mainly driven by the increase in our sales volume by 19.8% from 170.1 kt in the first quarter of 2013 to 203.7 kt in the first quarter of 2014. The lower increase in our net sales relative to the increase in our sales volume was due to lower scrap and alloy surcharges as a consequence of lower raw materials prices.
The increase in our sales volume in the first quarter was the result of both higher production rates among our customers as a result of improving economic conditions and new business won during 2013. The proportion of orders with short lead times remains relatively high, and we

71

believe that our customers' inventory levels have not increased significantly. Our order intake strengthened slightly in the first quarter, with an improvement of approximately 9% compared to the same period in 2013.

Cost of goods sold in the first quarter of 2014 increased by EUR11.1 million, or 5.5%, from EUR203.2 million in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR214.3 million in the first quarter of 2014. The increase in our cost of goods sold mainly reflected increased consumption of raw materials as a result of higher sales volume, which was partially offset by lower raw materials prices. The increases in the costs for supplies and freight and distribution costs were also mainly driven by the increased sales volume in the first quarter of 2014. The cost impact of higher energy consumption, driven by higher sales, in the first quarter of 2014 was partially offset by a lower average spot price for electricity in the first quarter of 2014 and reduced electricity costs as a result of our new electricity prices hedging policy. The increase in demand and sales volume led to an increase in our inventory volumes, which was the key reason for the increase in the positive impact of changes in inventories and work in progress to EUR9.2 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to EUR5.2 million in the first quarter of 2013.
Selling expenses. Our selling expenses increased by EUR0.2 million, or 3.7%, from EUR5.4 million in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR5.6 million in the first quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to our strengthened sales presence in China and Italy.
Administrative expenses. Our administrative expenses increased by EUR0.3 million, or 3.4%, from EUR8.7 million in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR9.0 million in the first quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to salary inflation.
Other operating income. Our other operating income increased by EUR0.2 million, or 25%, from EUR0.8 million in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR1.0 million in the first quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to insurance compensation of EUR0.5 million in the first quarter of 2014 in relation to the fire at our Imatra mill in 2013, compared to the insurance compensation of EUR0.4 million in the first quarter of 2013.
Operating profit/(loss). As a result of the factors discussed above our operating profit increased by EUR14.3 million, or from EUR3.7 million in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR18.0 million in the first quarter of 2014.
Financial income. Our financial income increased by EUR0.1 million, or from EUR0.1 million in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR0.2 million in the first quarter of 2014.
Financial expenses. Our financial expenses decreased by EUR1.5 million, or 17.4%, from EUR8.6 million in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR7.1 million in the first quarter of 2014. This decrease was primarily due to negative effects of currency revaluation in the first quarter of 2013.

72

Profit (loss) before taxes. As a result of the factors discussed above we recorded a profit before taxes of EUR11.1 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to a loss before taxes of EUR4.8 million in first quarter of 2013.
Taxes. As a result of our profit in the first quarter of 2014, we recorded a tax expense of EUR3.0 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to a tax credit of EUR1.1 million in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of our loss in the same period.
Net profit (loss) for the period. As a result of the factors discussed above we recorded a net profit of EUR8.1 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to a net loss of EUR3.7 million in first quarter of 2013.

Net sales. Net sales in 2013 decreased by EUR87.2 million, or 9.3%, from EUR937.1 million in 2012 to EUR849.9 million in 2013. The decrease in net sales in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to the decrease in our sales volume from 694 kt in 2012 to 675 kt in 2013 and reduced scrap and alloy surcharges as a result of a decrease in raw material prices. In addition, an adverse shift in product mix and a slightly negative base price trend also negatively impacted our net sales in 2013.
The decrease in sales volume in 2013 was attributable to the period from January to August, reflecting the continuing uncertainty in the economic conditions. In addition, a fire at our manufacturing facility at Imatra in May 2013 resulted in a production stop for approximately six weeks, which also contributed to the decrease in our sale volume. In 2012, we also experienced a fire at Imatra, which resulted in a production stop for approximately five weeks. Our sales volume started to increase again in September 2013 resulting in higher sales volumes in September, October, November and December of 2013 compared to the corresponding periods in 2012, which partially offset lower sales volumes in the first eight months of 2013. We believe that the increase in demand from September 2013 was primarily driven by a combination of a more positive economic outlook and our initiatives to grow revenue. Our order intake in 2013 increased by approximately 10%, compared to 2012.

The decrease in our net sales in the Nordics was primarily driven by decreases in our net sales in Sweden and Finland, which are our largest markets in the Nordics. The decreases in our net sales in Western Europe (excluding the Nordics) were primarily driven by decreases in Germany, the United Kingdom and France, which are our main markets in Western Europe. The decrease of our net sales in Germany was slightly lower than our decrease in net sales in Sweden, which reflects a later start of the economic recovery in Sweden.

Note: (1) Other operating costs comprise costs for repairs and maintenance, external services in production and other external services
related to production.
Cost of goods sold in 2013 decreased by EUR63.1 million, or 7.3%, from EUR869.7 million in 2012 to EUR806.6 million in 2013. The decrease in cost of goods sold in 2013 mainly reflected decreases in raw material costs, costs related to changes in inventories and work in progress, energy costs, other operating costs, costs for supplies and freight and other distribution costs.

Our reduced raw materials costs in 2013 were mainly attributable to reduced prices for scrap and alloy and an improved optimization of our use of alloy contained in scrap, which reduced our costs for alloy. The impact of changes in inventories and work in progress on our cost of goods sold resulted in an increase of cost of goods sold by EUR2.6 million in 2013, compared to an increase of EUR15.9 million in 2012. The lower impact of changes in inventories and work in progress in 2013 was primarily due to the lower decrease in inventory volume in 2013. In 2012, our inventory volume decreased significantly reflecting both a significant decrease in sales volume and our decision to actively manage our working capital. The decrease in our energy expenses was the result of lower consumption of energy in 2013 and reduced electricity costs as a

74

result of our new electricity prices hedging policy, which we adopted in the spring of 2012 and which reduced our costs in relation to electricity hedging contracts in 2013. The decrease in our other operating costs was primarily due to our initiatives to reduce operating costs in relation to maintenance and become more efficient. The reduction in our costs for supplies mainly reflected a lower consumption as a result of decreases in our sales volume. The decrease in our freight and other distribution costs was mainly driven by lower sales volume and the impact of lower transportation costs in Eastern Europe as a result of renegotiated transportation agreements, which became effective on October 1, 2013.
Our employee benefit expenses in 2013 decreased by 0.3%. Our cost savings in 2013 as a result of headcount reductions accounted for within cost of goods sold through reductions in production shifts and flexible work time arrangements in Sweden and Finland were partially offset by the appreciation of the SEK against the euro and salary inflation. On a constant currency basis, our employee benefit expenses in 2013 decreased by EUR1.2 million, or 0.8%, compared to 2012.
Selling expenses. Selling expenses in 2013 remained stable compared to our selling expenses in 2012 despite the strengthening of our sales presence in a number of markets, such as Eastern Europe, China and Italy. The majority of our selling expenses relate to employee costs.
Administrative expenses. The decrease in administrative expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly attributable to cost reductions and reductions of administrative personnel at our main production units in Sweden and Finland.
Other operating income. Other operating income decreased slightly in 2013 compared to 2012. Both years included insurance compensations in relation to fires at our Imatra mill in Finland. A higher insurance compensation of EUR8.0 million in 2013, compared to EUR7.3 million in 2012, was offset by decrease in rents and other income items.
Operating profit/(loss). As a result of the factors discussed above we suffered an operating loss in 2013, compared to an operating profit in 2012.
Financial income. Our financial income remained substantially stable in 2013 compared to 2012. There was an increase of EUR0.1 million in 2013 compared to 2012 due to an increase in income arising from receivables.
Financial costs. Financial costs decreased by EUR6.4 million from EUR33.2 million in 2012 to EUR26.8 million in 2013, which was primarily attributable to positive effects of currency revaluation of pension liabilities and cash items of EUR3.4 million in 2013, while the financial costs in 2012 were affected by an impairment of financial receivables of EUR1.3 million and a negative currency revaluation of pension liabilities and cash items of EUR2.9 million. These cost decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expenses for financial liabilities at amortized cost.
Profit before taxes. As a result of the factors discussed above our loss before taxes in 2013 increased significantly compared to 2012.
Taxes. The decrease in our tax credit was primarily due to a decrease in the income tax rate in Sweden, which became effective on January 1, 2013, which led to a revaluation of deferred tax liabilities as at December 31, 2012.
Net profit/(loss) for the year. As a result of the factors discussed above our net loss for 2013 decreased significantly compared to 2012.

Net sales. Net sales decreased by EUR183.5 million, or 16.4%, from EUR1,120.6 million in 2011 to EUR937.1 million in 2012. The decrease in net sales in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily attributable to a significant decrease in sales volume, which decreased by 157 kt, or 18%, from 851 kt in 2011 to 694 kt in 2012. The negative effect of the volume decrease was partially offset by a slight increase in base price.

The significant reduction in sales volume was primarily due to a significant decrease in demand for our products as a result of the unfavorable economic conditions, which were challenging throughout 2012 due to great uncertainty over developments in Europe and globally. Orders were weak as a result of lower production rates combined with inventory drawdowns by our customers. Our order intake in 2012 decreased by approximately 22%, compared to 2011.

Cost of goods sold decreased by EUR107.7 million, or 11.0%, from EUR977.4 million in 2011 to EUR869.7 million in 2012. The decrease in cost of goods sold in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily the result of decreases in raw materials costs, energy costs, costs for supplies and freight and other distribution costs, which were offset by higher costs related to changes in inventories and work in progress.
Our reduced raw materials costs in 2012 were mainly due to the reduced consumption of raw materials as a result of the significant decrease in our sales volume, which decreased by 18% from 851 kt in 2011 to 694 kt in 2012, and reduced prices for scrap and alloy. The significant decrease in volume was also the main driver for the decreases in costs for energy and supplies and freight and other distribution costs. Changes in inventories and work in progress had a negative impact on costs of goods sold in 2012, compared to a positive impact in 2011. This reflects the significant decrease in our inventories in 2012 as a result of the significant decrease in sales volume and our decision to actively manage our working capital. In 2011, our inventories increased significantly reflecting an increase in our sales volume.
Our employee benefit expenses in 2012 decreased by 1.0%. Our cost savings in 2012 as a result of headcount reductions accounted for within cost of goods sold through reductions in production shifts at our steel mills and flexible work time arrangements in Sweden and Finland were partially offset by the appreciation of the SEK against the euro and salary inflation. On a constant currency basis, our employee benefit expenses in 2012 decreased by EUR6.3 million, or 4.0%, compared to 2011.
Selling expenses. Our selling expenses in 2012 were slightly higher than in 2011, mainly reflecting the strengthening of our sales and marketing organization in response to the significant drop in sales volume amid uncertain economic conditions, which we started in 2012.
Administrative expenses. The slight increase in our administrative expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly attributable to the strengthening of the SEK against the EUR.
Other operating income. The significant increase in other operating income in 2012 was due to an insurance compensation we received in 2012 in relation to a fire at our Imatra mill in Finland in August 2012. Other operating income in 2011 did not include insurance compensation.
Operating profit/(loss). As a result of the factors discussed above our operating profit in 2012 was significantly below our operating profit in 2011.
Financial income. The slight decrease in financial income in 2012 compared to 2011 was the result of a decrease in interest income from receivables.
Financial costs. The decrease in financial costs was the result of a decrease in interest expenses for financial liabilities, partially offset by exchange losses and impairment of financial receivables.

77

Profit before taxes. As a result of the factors discussed above, we suffered a loss before taxes in 2012, compared to a profit before taxes in 2012. Taxes. The income tax credit in 2012 included a positive impact of the change in income tax rate in Sweden from January 1, 2013, which led to a revaluation of deferred tax liabilities as at December 31, 2012. Net profit/(loss) for the year. As a result of the factors discussed above, we suffered a net loss in 2012, compared to a net profit in 2011.
Liquidity and capital resources
General. Our principal source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations together with our short- and long-term debt financing. Our principal liquidity requirements have been and are expected to be the purchase of raw materials and the payment of employee expenses, energy and supplies. We can manage our liquidity needs in the Group by using our cash-pooling arrangements. Following completion of the Refinancing, our principal source of liquidity will continue to be cash generated from operations and will be supplemented by amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility. We expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility to service our working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes. Borrowings and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to certain conditions precedent, including compliance with financial maintenance and other covenants and representations and warranties. We expect to roll over into the Revolving Credit Facility from our Senior Credit Facilities an overdraft facility for approximately EUR10 million and approximately EUR2.5 million in bank guarantees. See "Description o f other indebtedness--Revolving Credit Facility" for a description of the Revolving Credit Facility. Our ability to generate cash from our operations depends on our future operating performance, which in turn depends on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in this offering memorandum. See "Risk factors". Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings and cash on hand will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs over the next 12 months, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

Comparison between the Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013. Net cash flows from operating activities was a net cash inflow of EUR5.0 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to a net cash outflow of EUR14.8 million in the first quarter of 2013. This increase was primarily due to our operating profit of EUR18.0 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to an operating profit of EUR3.7 million in the first quarter of 2013 and lower changes in working capital, which resulted in a cash outflow of EUR18.0 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to a cash outflow of EUR21.6 million in the first quarter of 2013.
Despite a considerably higher rate of production and increased delivery volumes, working capital for the first quarter of 2014 remained stable compared to the first quarter of 2013, but due to seasonality, working capital increased since December 31, 2013.
Net cash flows used in investing activities remained largely stable at EUR7.5 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to EUR7.4 million in the first quarter of 2013.

79

Net cash flows from financing activities amounted to a net cash inflow of EUR1.0 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to a net cash outflow of EUR5.4 million in the first quarter of 2013. The cash inflow from financing activities in the first quarter of 2014 was primarily due to a EUR10.0 million drawdown in the first quarter of 2014 under our revolving credit facility provided in our Senior Facilities Agreement to finance working capital, which was offset by higher repayments of borrowings of EUR9.0 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to a cash outflow of EUR5.4 million in the first quarter of 2013.
Comparison between the Years Ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Net cash flows from operating activities decreased by EUR67.1 million, or 77.2%, from EUR86.9 million in 2012 to EUR19.8 million in 2013. This decrease mainly resulted from an operating loss of EUR0.6 million in 2013, compared to an operating profit of EUR19.9 million in 2012, and changes in working capital, which resulted in a cash inflow in the amount of EUR53.8 million in 2012, compared to a cash outflow of EUR4.2 million in 2013. The significant cash inflow in 2012 as a result of changes in working capital was primarily due the significant decrease in sales volumes to 694 kt in 2012, compared to 851 kt in 2011, reflecting lower demand for our products as a result of the unfavorable economic environment, which led to decreases in trade receivables and inventories. In addition, in 2012, we were able to extend payment terms with suppliers, which was the key driver for the increase in trade payables in 2012. The positive impact on our cash flow from changes in working capital in 2012 was partially offset by an income tax payment in the amount of EUR15.2 million, compared to a tax credit of EUR0.1 million in 2013. In 2013, as a result of a lower decrease in sales volume from 694 kt in 2012 to 675 kt in 2013, the decreases in our trade receivables and inventories in 2013 were significantly lower than the decreases in 2012.
Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by EUR2.9 million, or 6.0%, from EUR48.7 million in 2012 to EUR45.8 million in 2013, primarily due to a slight decrease in capital expenditure (which we define as purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets) from EUR48.2 million in 2012 to EUR44.9 million in 2013. A decrease in capital expenditure in 2013 was in line with our Investment plan. However, the planned decrease in capital expenditure was partially offset by higher replacement investments at Imatra as a result of the fire in August 2013, which led to an additional capital expenditure of EUR3.4 million in 2013, which was not provided for in our investment plan. While we also experienced a fire at Imatra in 2012, the replacements investments in relation to the fire in 2012 were lower and amounted to EUR1.8 million.
Net cash flows used in financing activities amounted to EUR28.9 million in 2012, compared to net cash flows from financing of EUR4.9 million in 2013. The cash outflow from financing activities in 2012 was due to our repayment of borrowings in the amount of EUR28.9 million. In 2012, in addition to the mandatory instalment payments we also decided to use our cash flow to prepay some of the principal amounts outstanding under our long-term borrowings in order to benefit from pro rata reductions of our instalment payments due to voluntary prepayments. The cash inflow from financing activities in 2013 was primarily due to a EUR20 million drawdown under our Revolving Credit Facility to finance working capital and lower repayments of borrowings, which in 2013 amounted to EUR15.1 million.
Comparison between the Years Ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Net cash flows from operating activities increased by EUR30.8 million, or 54.9%, from EUR56.1 million in 2011 to EUR86.9 million in 2012, despite a decrease in our operating profit by EUR69.9 million, or 77.8%, from EUR89.8 million in 2011 to EUR19.9 million in 2012. This increase was primarily driven by changes in our working capital, which resulted in a cash inflow in the amount of EUR53.8 million in 2012, compared to a cash outflow of EUR35.4 million in 2011. The significant cash inflow in 2012 as a result of changes in working capital was primarily due the significant decrease in sales volumes to 694 kt in 2012, compared to 851 kt in 2011, reflecting lower demand for our products as a result of the unfavorable economic environment, which led to decreases in trade receivables and inventories. In addition, in 2012, we were able to extend payment terms with suppliers, which was the key driver for the increase in trade payables in 2012. In 2011, there was a cash outflow as a result of working capital changes, which reflected increases in trade receivables, inventories and trade payables following an increase in our sales volume to 851 kt in 2011.
80

Net cash flows used in investing activities increased by EUR14.9 million, or 44.1%, from EUR33.8 million in 2011 to EUR48.7 million in 2012, primarily due to higher planned capital expenditure in 2012 than 2011 in connection with our investment plan.

Net cash used in financing activities increased by EUR15.0 million, or 107.9%, from EUR13.9 million in 2011 to EUR28.9 million in 2012, primarily due to our decision in 2012 to prepay some of the principal amounts outstanding under our long-term borrowings in order to benefit from pro rata reductions of our required amortization payments due to voluntary prepayments.

Trade working capital. The following table sets forth the main components of our trade working capital for each of the periods presented.

The significant decreases in our inventories and trade receivables were primarily due to a significant decrease in our sales volumes to 694 kt in 2012, compared to 851 kt in 2011, reflecting lower demand for our products as a result of the unfavorable economic environment. As the drop in sales volume from 2012 to 2013 was less significant, our inventories and trade receivables decreased only slightly from 2012 to 2013. In 2012, we were able to extend payment terms with suppliers, which was the key driver for the increase in trade payables.
We have actively managed our trade working capital since 2011 in order to achieve what we believe is an efficient working capital cycle. For example, by extending payment terms with suppliers, our average days of outstanding trade payables increased from 26 days in 2011 to 35 days and 40 days in 2012 and 2013, respectively. At the same time, we were able to maintain a stable average days of trade receivables outstanding, which were 43 days, 42 days and 43 days in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. We also managed our inventory actively. Our average days of inventory outstanding were 88 days, 95 days and 94 days in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. This reflects our increased focus on inventory management and efficiency as we managed to keep our inventory level stable between 2012 and 2013 despite increased customer activity and rises in order volumes. During periods when we build up our inventory, for example in response to increases in demand for our products, our cash flow is negatively impacted but our results from operations are positively impacted. In 2012, our inventories decreased significantly, which was attributable to both the significant decrease in our sales volume in 2012 and our decision to actively manage our working capital. This contributed to a significant cash inflow but had a negative impact on our results of operations. The impact of changes in our inventories in 2013 was less significant, reflecting a lower decrease in sales volume compared to 2012 and inventory build up in the second half of the year reflecting increased demand for our products. In the first quarter of 2014, inventory volumes increased compared to the corresponding quarter of 2013, reflecting increased sales volume and higher production. Due to lower raw material prices in the first quarter of 2014, the value of our inventories on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2014 is slightly below the value of our inventories as of March 31, 2013.
Capital expenditures and investments
The following table sets forth our capital expenditures, which includes purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, for each of the periods indicated. We generally distinguish between expansion capital expenditure and maintenance capital expenditure. Expansion capital expenditure, according to our classification, includes strategic growth and cost savings investments as well as investments due to regulatory requirements. Maintenance capital expenditure includes all other capital expenditure.

Capital expenditure in 2013 amounted to EUR21.0 million of expansion capital expenditure and EUR23.9 million of maintenance capital expenditure. Maintenance capital expenditure in 2013 also included replacements investments due to the fire at our steel mill in Imatra in August 2013. Excluding these replacement investments, our maintenance capital expenditure in 2013 was EUR20.5 million. Our expansion capital expenditure in 2013 included the following specific projects:
 EUR9.0 million in connection with a new state-of-the art de-dusting filter in Smedjebacken to meet future environmental requirements and to reduce the risk of business disruption.
 EUR5.2 million in connection with the comprehensive modernization of our tube mill in Hofors to reduce personnel, energy costs and improve yield.
 EUR2.0 million in connection with our new automated peeling line at our rolling mill in Hllefors to meet the increase we expect in demand for diesel injection systems in IQ-steel. This project was completed in 2013.
 EUR1.3 million in connection with our new ring mill in Hofors to expand our product lines and to cater for the increase we expect in demand for large rings for power generation, including wind mills. This project was completed in 2013.
 EUR1.1 million in connection with preparatory work for our new continuous casting machine at our steel mill in Smedjebacken to replace the existing machine due to age and to reduce maintenance costs. This project will be implemented in July of 2014.
The remaining expansion capital expenditure of EUR2.5 million related to other strategic growth and cost saving investments.
Capital expenditure in 2012 amounted to EUR21.0 million of expansion capital expenditure and EUR27.2 million of maintenance capital expenditure. Maintenance capital expenditure in 2012 also included EUR1.8 million of replacements investments due to the fire at our steel mill in Imatra in May 2012. Excluding these replacement investments, our maintenance capital expenditure in 2012 was EUR25.3 million. Our expansion capital expenditure in 2012 included the following specific projects:
 EUR4.5 million in connection with the comprehensive modernization of our tube mill in Hofors to reduce personnel, energy costs and improve yield.
 EUR4.4 million in connection with our new automated peeling line at our rolling mill in Hllefors to meet expected long-term growing demand for diesel injection systems in IQ-steel.
 EUR4.2 million in connection with a new de-dusting filter in Smedjebacken to meet future environmental requirements and to reduce the risk of business disruption.
 EUR3.7 million in connection with our new ring mill in Hofors to expand our product lines and to cater for the expected increase in demand for large rings for power generation, including wind mills.
The remaining expansion capital expenditure of EUR4.3 million related to other strategic growth and cost saving investments.

82

Capital expenditure in 2011 amounted to EUR14.6 million of expansion capital expenditure and EUR18.9 million of maintenance capital expenditure. Unlike 2013 and 2012, maintenance capital expenditure in 2011 did not include replacements investments due to fires. Our expansion capital expenditure in 2011 included the following specific projects:
 EUR2.7 million in connection with our new ring mill in Hofors to cater for the increase we expect in demand for large rings for power generation, including wind mills.
 EUR1.3 million in connection with our new automated peeling line at our rolling mill in Hllefors to meet expected long-term growing demand for diesel injection systems in IQ-steel.
 EUR0.3 million in connection with the comprehensive modernization of our tube mill in Hofors to reduce personnel, energy costs and improve yield.
The remaining expansion capital expenditure of EUR10.4 million related to other strategic growth and cost saving investments.
We estimate that, in the medium term, our total capital expenditure will be between approximately EUR25 million and EUR35 million per year, of which between approximately EUR15 million and EUR20 million per year is expected to be attributable to maintenance capital expenditure to maintain the current state of our operations.
Our budget for 2014 provides for capital expenditure of EUR25 to EUR 30 million including:
 EUR5.0 million in connection with the new continuous casting machine at our steel mill in Smedjebacken to replace the existing machine due to age and reduce maintenance costs, which is scheduled to be implemented in July of 2014.
 EUR1.6 million in connection with a new de-dusting filter in Smedjebacken to meet future environmental requirements.
 EUR1.3 million in connection with the comprehensive modernization of our tube mill in Hofors to reduce personnel, energy costs and improve yield.

Off-balance sheet arrangements
Our off-balance sheet commitments relate principally to operating leases and guarantees issued by banks in the ordinary course in connection with our electricity hedging arrangements and customs. See note 29 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these guarantees. In addition, our Pension Insurance Line provides for guarantees to be issued in connection with our pension obligations and is intended to pay our pension obligations in the event we become insolvent. See "--Pension liabilities" and "--Pension Insurance Line".
Pension liabilities
We have entered into a number of pension plans in accordance with local regulations and agreements, which include both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Certain group companies have specific pension plans for management personnel. In Sweden, there are both defined contribution plans, for which pension payments are managed by insurance companies and defined benefit plans, for which our pension obligations are secured in the Swedish PRI/FPG system. Pension benefits in our Finnish companies are secured by local insurance companies and a voluntary pension agreement covered by supplemental insurance. Pensions in Finland are mainly covered by the statutory TEL pension system. As of December 31, 2013, the net liability of our pensions and other post-employment benefit obligations amounted to EUR72.5 million. See note 19 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding pensions and other post-employment benefits.
Pension Insurance Line
On or prior to the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries will enter into a super senior pension insurance line agreement (the "Original Pension Insurance Line Agreement") expressed to be governed by English law with, Nordea Bank AB (publ) as agent (the "PIL Agent"), Nordea Bank Finland Plc as issuing bank (the "Issuing Bank"), ACE European Group Ltd and HCC International Insurance Company PLC as original lenders and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as the security agent, providing for a committed SEK440.0 million pension insurance line (the "Original Pension Insurance Line"). Subject to certain exceptions, utilizations may be utilized, repaid and re-utilized at any time, however only five utilizations are allowed to be outstanding at any time. Utilizations under the Original Pension Insurance Line may be used for the issuance by the Issuing Bank of a pension insurance guarantee in favor of PRI Pensionsgaranti, Mutual Insurance Company in respect of certain pension liabilities of the Group or to refinance pension guarantee commitments under the Senior Facilities Agreement.
The Original Pension Insurance Line matures on the date falling four years and nine months after the Issue Date.
The pension guarantee commission payable to each lender is 2.85% per annum on the outstanding amount of each pension insurance guarantee.
We are also required to pay a commitment fee in arrears on the last day of each successive threemonth period during the availability of the Original Pension Insurance Line, on the available but unused commitments under the Original Pension Insurance Line at a rate of 50% of the pension guarantee commission. The fronting fee payable to the Issuing Bank is 0.125% per annum on the outstanding amount which is counter-indemnified by the relevant lenders of each pension insurance guarantee.
The Original Pension Insurance Line will be guaranteed by, among others, the Parent Company, the Issuer, and the other Guarantors and will be secured by the same Collateral that secures the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Guarantor Threshold Test under the Revolving Credit Facility will apply also in respect of the Original Pension Insurance Line. See "Description o f other indebtedness--Revolving Credit Facility".
84

Subject to certain conditions, we may voluntarily prepay all or part of our utilizations or permanently cancel all or part of the available commitments under the Original Pension Insurance Line, by giving five or three, respectively, business days' prior written notice to the PIL Agent. Amounts prepaid or repaid may (subject to the terms of the Original Pension Insurance Line Agreement) be reborrowed. In addition to any voluntary prepayments, the Mandatory Prepayment Provisions under the Revolving Credit Facility apply to the Original Pension Insurance Line. See "Description o f other indebtedness--Revolving Credit Facility".
The Restrictive Covenants, Information Undertakings and Event of Default Provisions under the Revolving Credit Facility also apply to the Original Pension Insurance Line. See "Description o f other indebtedness--Revolving Credit Facility".
The occurrence of any event of default would, subject to any applicable grace periods, cure rights or agreed exceptions, entitle the lenders under the Original Pension Insurance Line to cancel their commitments, demand cash cover in respect of each pension insurance guarantee (immediately due and payable or payable on demand).
No Default or Event of Default (other than payment defaults) shall be deemed to have occurred or be continuing under the Original Pension Insurance Line unless a corresponding Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (or any replacement facility) and such Default or Event of Default shall only be continuing for as long as the corresponding Default or Event of Default is continuing under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.
Provided that the creditors of the Pension Insurance Line (the " PIL Lenders") are permitted to take enforcement action, a standstill period of (i) 120 days if they take enforcement action due to a payment default and (i) 150 days if they take enforcement action due to any other default, from the date when they effectively delivered an enforcement notice will apply. The PIL Lenders may not take any action during this period.
The Restricted Group may further enter into any additional Pension Insurance Line Agreement (an "Additional Pension Insurance Line Agreement") pursuant to which pension liabilities of the Restricted Group are guaranteed provided that:
(i) no default may occur under the terms of the relevant Pension Insurance Line Agreement and any other finance documents relating to the relevant Pension Insurance Line, unless there is also a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement;
(ii) the relevant Pension Insurance Line Agreement does not contain any financial covenant; and
(iii) the lenders and other finance parties to the relevant Pension Insurance Line Agreement have acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement.
Any Pension insurance Line under such Additional Pension Insurance Line Agreement (an "Additional Pension Insurance Line") will rank pari passu with the Original Pension Insurance Line and will benefit from a first-ranking, super senior security interest in the Collateral.
Any Pension Insurance Line may be refinanced, and Additional Pension Insurance Lines may be put in place, to increase commitments up to the amount of our pension liability at the time of such increase. Pension liabilities supported or guaranteed by any Pension Insurance Line will be subject to certain restrictions under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Original Pension Insurance Line Agreement.
In addition, no member of the Group may incur any pension liabilities supported or guaranteed by a Pension Insurance Line to the extent that such pension liabilities result from:
(a) an acquisition of a business or undertaking;
(b) the entry by a member of the Group into a joint venture; or
85

(c) any member of the Group making any green field investment, including, without limitation, the start-up of a new business or undertaking,
to the extent that the aggregate commitments under all Pension Insurance Line Agreements are in excess of, or would be (taking into account such Pension Liabilities) be in excess of EUR70,000,000.
Quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risks
We are exposed to various types of risks including the risk of changes in exchange rates, interest rates, electricity prices, raw materials prices, risks in relation emissions credit, operational risks, liquidity and refinancing risks and credit and counterparty risks.
Foreign currency risk. Foreign currency risk is the risk of changes in exchange rates that adversely affect our earnings, equity and competitiveness. Translation exposure arises from translation of currencies in our subsidiaries' financial statements to the group's presentation currency, the EUR. Translations that cause fluctuations in consolidated equity comprise investments in subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the EUR. Since all major subsidiaries, including those in Sweden, use the EUR as their functional currency translation exposure is limited. Transaction exposure arises from exchange rate changes in net cash flow from business transactions in currencies other than the base currency. These changes affect profit and loss and the balance sheet continually throughout the year. Our borrowings are denominated in EUR and are intended to act as hedges against anticipated operating inflows in EUR. Other currency flows that arise in connection with purchases and sales are short-term in nature and are normally not hedged. Our management may decide from time to time to hedge contracted net exposure from sales and purchases in currencies other than the base or trading currency to secure margins. No significant currency derivatives existed in 2012 or most of 2013, but in November 2013 the group signed a foreign exchange forward contract that hedges approximately 37% of the estimated net outflow in SEK during 2014, with a total value of approximately EUR75 million.
Electricity price risk. Electricity price risk refers to the risk that changes in market prices for electricity will have an adverse impact on our earnings. We use hedge accounting for electricity derivatives since these have been designated as cash flow hedges. See note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 for further information.
Operational risks. There are several processes involved in steel production, and disruptions in one process may have serious effects in other process streams. There is a risk that operational downtime caused by factors such as transport problems or process disruptions will become very costly. These risks are mitigated by reducing raw materials inventories, work in progress and finished goods inventories. We also carry insurance to minimize costs in the event of damage and disruption.
Liquidity and refinancing risk. Liquidity and refinancing risk is the risk of us having insufficient access to funds necessary to meet our obligations.
Credit and counterparty risk. Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations. We are exposed to credit and counterparty risk against financial counterparties when funds are deposited, when positive cash balances are maintained with banks and when financial derivatives are acquired. These risks are minimized by contracting only with financially stable banks or other counterparties.
Beyond the foregoing, credit risks are associated with trade receivables. Exposure to credit risk in trade receivables is managed according to the principles set out in the Credit Management Rules and Guidelines established by our management. According to these principles, credit risk in trade receivables is managed primarily through credit risk insurance, but also bank guarantees, advance and cash payment requirements and letter of credit to reduce the credit risk. A credit limit is established for each customer by our insurance company or internal control. The non covered part of the trade receivables should not exceed 2% of estimated yearly invoicing. At
86

year-end, over 95% of our outstanding trade receivables were covered by credit insurance. The five largest customers (groups including subsidiaries) account for 31% of consolidated sales and trade receivables. See note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 for further information regarding our credit and counterparty risk.
Critical accounting policies
The preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions, based on the information available at the time of the preparation of the financial statements, that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as other disclosures. Estimates and related assumptions are based on historical experience and many other factors believed to represent the best available parameters for measuring assets and liabilities. Actual outcomes may differ from the estimates. We consider the following estimates and judgments to be the most critical in understanding the assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our financial results, financial condition and cash flows. A more detailed description of our accounting policies is provided in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Pension benefit assumptions. Pension benefit obligations are based on actuarial valuations. A discount rate is used to measure the present value of the defined benefit obligations. These assumptions are assessed at least once a year for all plans in each country. Other assumptions, which may relate to demographic factors such as age of retirement, mortality rates and employee turnover, are reviewed less frequently and usually based on public statistics in each country. See note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 for a sensitivity analysis showing the effects on the Swedish PRI/FPG liability of a change in the material assumptions underlying the calculation. Valuations o f inventories. Valuations of inventories contain estimates of net realizable value and assumptions pertaining to cost distribution and normal capacity, which may affect the carrying amount. Impairment testing. The carrying amounts of our non-current assets are tested to determine whether there is any indication of impairment loss when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount will not be recovered. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is measured as the discounted cash flows expected to arise from the asset or the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. No indications of impairment in our non-current assets were found during the year ended December 31, 2013. There is no goodwill recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013.
87

Industry
Due to the lack o f publicly available information on the engineering steel segment o f the steel market, we commissioned the Metal Strategies Report. Generally, the industry and market data presented below is, unless otherwise indicated, taken or derived from the Metal Strategies Report. We have not independently verified and cannot give any assurance as to the accuracy of the industry and market data taken or derived from third party sources or contained in the Metal Strategies Report. See "Industry and Market Data". Industry and market data are subject to uncertainty and do not necessarily reflect actual industry or market conditions. They are based on industry or market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and respondents, including judgments about what types o f products and competitors should be included in the relevant market.
Introduction to engineering steel
Grades and shapes
While there is a general understanding of what constitutes engineering steels, there is no precise definition. There are a number of differentiating factors between engineering steels, quality steel and basic carbon steels, from raw materials and alloys used, to the applications and to the mill equipment.
Engineering steels are steels for special engineering purposes also known as Special Bar Quality ("SBQ") and are defined in this section as alloyed steels (including bearing steels) and micro alloyed steels. Micro alloyed steels have alloy content below that of the alloyed steels and have special properties that make them appropriate in certain engineering applications. The term long engineering steel products describes engineering steels in the shape of hot rolled bar and semi finished products (ingots, blooms and billets) for production of seamless tubes and forged long products. They accounted for approximately 15% of all steels supplied as long products in the EU27 during 2013. Long products includes long engineering steel products and also wire and other long product shapes in multiple steels including several non-engineering steels.
Engineering steels, stainless steels, alloyed tool steels and other high alloyed steels, such as, special alloyed steels and nickel alloy steels are commonly referred to as special steels (or specialty steels).
Production process
About 75% of all steel made worldwide, and over 90% of steel made in China, is made via the integrated steelmaking route relying on coal, coke, iron ore, blast furnaces and basic oxygen steel-making furnaces ("BOF"). In contrast, the majority of engineering steel is made using the more flexible electric arc furnace ("EAF") steel-making route which is based on ferrous scrap or direct reduced iron feed as the primary raw material and uses natural gas (in rare cases also fuel oil) and electricity to melt the raw material. In addition to its greater operating flexibility, EAF steel production involves 50% lower capital costs and 75% lower carbon emissions than integrated steel making.
The EAF, when used more on a customized batch processing basis, offers the advantage of not being a continuous process such as that relied on by mini mills and blast furnace-based integrated steel mills. Each batch of molten steel in an EAF can therefore be specifically built up by selecting scrap containing particular alloys and, together with external alloys, influence the properties of the specific melt. The EAF process is therefore very well suited for the production of a wide variety of chemically different grades of steel as the composition of the produced steel can be theoretically changed in each melting process so that the minimum production size of each steel grade is the size of the EAF melting vessel. In the continuous melting process of a blast furnace, the initial steel produced is of uniform chemical composition and needs to be chemically altered in a further production step through the addition of alloys which imposes additional time and cost steps.
88

The basic process flow for long engineering steel products (bar or semi finished) is as follows:
 Cold ferrous scrap, and alternative iron material if used, is charged into the EAF vessel and melted via controlled lightning with electricity arcing between several electrodes inserted through the roof of the EAF into the scrap. A typical EAF will be charged with 75 to 200 tons of scrap. This melting process takes between 40 and 80 minutes. The EAF therefore works as a discrete batch process with each batch of scrap being molten separately.
 Fluxes are added to the charge mix in the EAF for the purpose of removing undesirable trace elements. The EAF technology can also be switched off and on at substantially lower cost and quicker time interval than a blast furnace due to the discrete batch melting process.
 The vessel containing the molten steel is lifted by crane and moved to an adjacent refining station where the chemistry, including carbon and alloy content, is adjusted to final customer and industry specifications by use of small electrodes and alloy additions.
 The molten steel is often further refined by either aluminum de-oxidation or vacuum degassing, to further purify the steel and remove excess nitrogen and other undesirable gasses to improve the purity of the steel and improve its properties in later use.
 The molten steel is then cast into its first semi-finished solid state either by pouring into an ingot mold (about 10% to 15% of engineering steels are made this way, especially for forging and high reduction ratio applications) or into a continuous caster to produce blooms or billets. Depending on final finished product form, this first semi-finished product is an ingot, a larger rectangular bloom, a smaller rectangular or square billet, or a tube round which is used for the production of seamless tubes.
 In order to make a bar, this semi-finished steel form is then processed through a hot rolling facility where the first stage is a reheat furnace (pit furnace, walking beam or older pusher style for bars and rods, or a rotary hearth for seamless tubes). On occasion, this step is minimized or by-passed using direct hot charging of the semi-finished product from the casting stage in order to minimize the energy costs resulting from re-heating.
 Once the semi-finished product is heated to rolling temperature in the reheat furnace it is passed through the hot rolling mill which includes a sequential series of both roughing and finishing stands, with each containing highly-powered rolling cylinders above and below to reduce the thickness and add length and grain structure to the steel product.
 The steel is further processed by cooling and quenching, annealing and tempering. About one-third of all engineering steel bars are further processed by one or more cold finishing processes, done either in-house by the steel producer or by a third-party processor.
Raw materials
Scrap is the main raw material used in the production of engineering steel, typically accounting for 95% or more of the EAF charge. Some engineering steel producers use a small amount of alternative iron sources, such as direct reduced iron ("DRI") and merchant pig iron ("MPI"). While integration strategies vary, most engineering steel producers purchase their iron-bearing raw materials in the market from third parties. Some producers own and operate their own scrap processing facilities and some own and operate DRI or MPI facilities.
Engineering steel producers also require alloys to add strength, abrasion resistance or machine ability to their steel products. The main alloys used in the production of engineering steel include nickel, molybdenum, manganese, chrome, vanadium, lead and tin, although most mills do not use lead.
The ability to source ferrous scrap and carefully sort purchased scrap according to the purity of the ferrous materials and according to the content of the various alloys that are included in the scrap materials represents an important value creation operation for engineering steel producers.
89

The alloys contained in scrap are usually cheaper to purchase than the pure metal alloys that the steel mill purchases. If the steel mill is able to maximize the content of the alloys required for a specific steel grade via the composition of the scrap charge in the EAF, it usually saves significant costs compared to the alternative of having to add the same quantity of pure alloys to the molten steel.
Prices
Engineering steel producers in Europe tend to offset the volatility in the price of both ferrous scrap and alloy by using a surcharge price formula whereby these costs are automatically passed onto customers. In general the steel mill would negotiate a base price for its products with its customer and at the same time agree a formula that calculated the surcharge for the scrap and the particular alloys of the steel grade in question. The surcharge prices are typically agreed to follow particular publicly quoted benchmark prices for scrap and alloys. The prices are often calculated based on price changes in the prior monthly period against an agreed upon base value and adjusted for a yield factor. Typical base and yield factors, respectively, for select alloys are: chrome EUR0.75 per kg, with 70% yield factor, manganese EUR0.65 per kg, with 70% yield factor; molybdenum EUR6.00 per kg with 85% yield factor; nickel EUR9.50 per kg, with 85% yield factor; and vanadium EUR18.50 per kg, with 85% yield factor.
Surcharges for scrap and alloys can be one-third or more of total product price and can be highly volatile in nature but the surcharges tend to largely offset underlying changes in scrap and alloy costs.
Engineering steels are made and sold at a significantly higher price premium, from 50% to over 100%, compared to basic carbon steels. Typical average prices for hot-rolled bar include: high alloy steel at prices over EUR2,000 per ton, engineering steel (alloyed steel and micro alloyed steel) at approximately EUR750 per ton, quality steel at approximately EUR650 per ton, and basic carbon steel at approximately EUR450 per ton.
In the past three years, alloy surcharges for engineering steel producers have ranged from EUR250to EUR450 per ton. Engineering steel producers use purchasing and recycling strategies to reduce their overall alloy costs. These include segregation of scrap grades by alloy content, recycling of alloys from the steel-making process, and purchasing of a portion of their alloy requirements as contained in scrap versus purchasing higher-priced virgin alloys.
In addition to the scrap and alloy surcharges, reduction ratios are an important factor in the pricing of engineering steels. The reduction ratio is the relationship of the surface area of the starting or first solid semi-finished product (ingot, bloom, billet, or tube round) to the surface area of the final finished product (engineering steel bar). A higher reduction ratio leads to higher quality steels which command a premium price. The chart below illustrates reduction ratios split in the engineering steel industry.

Reduction ratio split (%)

An example of reduction ratios used by sector and application are auto parts makers which often use 5:1, 7:1, and 9:1 for higher critical parts. In addition, for crankshafts 7:1. is oftern used, for gears 9.5:1 is often used, defense and off-highway production often use 8:1, 9:1 and 10:1, and engine parts often use 9:1, 12:1.
Also, by producing engineering steel products that are close to the end shape required by the customer, "near net-shape", the engineering steel mill can add substantial value to its products as it then reduces the cost spent by the customer to process the steel to its final component shape which commands a premium price.
Similarly, any improvements in the machineability of the steel (so called machining steel) that the steel mill can offer without compromising the final in-use properties of the steel therefore create substantial value for the customer. Better machineability would, for example, lead to higher machining speed, lower costs for cutting tools or fewer steps in processing all of which reduce the time and costs of the customer for producing final components, which in turn enables higher pricing for the products supplied by the steel mill.
Engineering steel, like other steel products, is sold either directly to the final end-user or through a distributor or processors. Steel is also sold on either a contract, typically one year with monthly or quarterly scrap and alloy surcharge adjustments, or on a spot basis, involving a three month or less purchasing cycle, the latter being the typical purchasing pattern of distributors.
Logistics
Logistics, freight costs including financing, and just-in-time delivery requirements are important factors limiting international geographic sales ranges primarily to each mill's immediate world region. For this reason, producers tend to significantly supply their immediate and regional markets.
The overall importance of logistics costs is also illustrated by the fact that the share of imports and exports into the EU's engineering steel market are of a similar magnitude. However, a key differentiating factor is that engineering steel imported into Europe is generally of more standardized grades while the engineering steel exported from the EU is mainly for use in more demanding applications that can be supplied by only a few European, American and Japanese producers. These end applications often tend to be the global production locations of multi national companies that require uniform and highest quality supply to their global locations, as well as increasingly select domestic producers of engineering goods in countries such as China or in South East Asia who seek to match in their products the performance of the western manufacturers.

Global long engineering steel market
The market for long engineering steel products worldwide is estimated to be in excess of 40 million tons of which eight to ten million tons is based in Europe, six to eight million tons in North America, two million tons in South America, Africa, the Middle East, and 18 million tons in Asia led by China, Japan, South Korea and India.
Long engineering steel products, therefore, represent about 3% of all steel mill products produced and consumed in the world. In 2013, world crude steel production was 1,656 million tons, while world finished steel consumption was 1,425 million tons. The following chart shows the major long alloy engineering steel product producers in the world (as measured for alloyed steels only and including wire).

Note: This chart shows global long engineering steel product capacity including wire. Source: Metal Strategies Inc.
The top world alloyed long engineering steel producers have combined capacity of approximately 30 million tons (including wire). More than half are based in Asia led by the Citic Group as the world's largest producer, followed by Japan's Nippon Sumitomo in second place and JFE in fifth place. Saarstahl of Germany is the world's third largest producer followed by Arcelor Mittal as number four with operations in Europe and North America. It is important to note that Saarstahl has focused predominantly on lower grades and and has a lesser focus on the higher alloyed grades that are developed in close collaboration with customers and also has a high share of wire.
Unlike ordinary carbon steels, engineering steels are mainly (approximately 80%) customdesigned to specific customer requirements, and are mainly sold on a direct to final end-user basis via annual contracts, as opposed to ordinary carbon steel products which significantly involve service centers and distributors on a spot market basis. Approximately 20% of all engineering steels sales are initially through the service center/distributor sector.
While still cyclical, the market for many engineering steel applications tends to be less volatile (for example, energy, aerospace, some industrial applications) than the market for ordinary carbon steels that depends largely on construction.
The major engineering steels end-markets are: automotive, including both passenger and medium and heavy duty commercial vehicles, (including engine, transmission, suspension systems--a significant portion of these applications are processed through forging sector), offhighway and severe services vehicles (including hydraulic pistons and wear parts of the equipment for such vehicles), energy in both utilities and in oil & gas (including drill rig collars), bearings (an intermediary market), ordnance, fasteners in specialty larger size ranges, hand tools, and aerospace.
Approximately 30% of all engineering steels is in larger sizes (over 90mm in diameter) and 10% is in the largest size range (over 150 mm in diameter) with only a limited number of producers worldwide in the largest size category.
92

The auto and truck sectors ultimately account for almost half of all engineering steels applications in Europe and most other global regions, although their relative share is declining moderately which provides a positive increase in diversification for engineering steel suppliers. Other key markets include forgings, industrial equipment, off-highway vehicles and energy. Imports are on the order of 5% to 10% of the market while exports are about the same volume and share of shipments.

European long engineering steel products market
Estimated annual average demand for long engineering steel products within the EU is between 6 and 10 million tons since 2008. Within Europe, most engineering steels are consumed in the main Western European continental countries led by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy. In Western Europe, the demand for heavy sizes, light vehicles grades and multipurpose and micro alloyed steel is approximately 1.7 kt, 1.3kt and 1.8 kt.
Engineering steel is a subset of total steel and, in turn, long product steel. The following table shows history and forecast of EU27 crude steel production and EU27 long product steel rolling mill output. At a recent trend average of 8 million tons (seen in 2010 and 2011), the long engineering steel products market in Europe represents 4% to 5% of total crude steel production and 10% to 15% of rolled long product steel output. The table below sets out historic changes in European crude steel production and hot-rolled long products production.

Key drivers for European heavy and medium duty trucks production include the following: - Increased construction activity in addition to onset of overall economic recovery - More stringent emissions standards being imposed in the EU - Structural growth of higher margin after-sales business
95

Yellow Goods Yellow goods include the following: construction vehicles, agricultural vehicles, mining and forestry equipment, cranes and overhead lifting equipment, lifting trucks and lift and skip hoists; elevators and conveyors; parts and accessories. The demand for European produced yellow goods is expected to recover meaningfully. Key drivers for yellow goods demand include the following: - Better outlook for construction, - Construction market recovery with residential and existing commercial inventory reaching full
absorption levels, - Infrastructure investment climate recovering in Europe and continuing to grow in emerging
markets, - Recovery in industrial capacity utilization.
Oil and Gas Significant exploration and production ("E&P") spending growth is anticipated over the next several years driven by increases in offshore drilling in areas such as Mexico and Brazil, emerging markets and shale related activity, especially in North America, South America, China and Australia.
Energy Production Economic growth is a key driver for the power sector with regulatory changes expected to act as a catalyst for renewable energy. The European power sector is now relying more on conventional capacity to grow given the reduction in nuclear capacity. Moreover, there is significant replacement demand as increasingly aged power stations are replaced. Wind power generation capacity has increased at a nearly 10% compound annual growth rate in Western Europe since 2010. Growth is expected to continue in line with improvements in technical performance of equipment and continued relative better economics compared to other sources of renewable energy. European investment in machinery and equipment is expected to gain traction in the coming years. Key factors boosting the outlook for machinery and equipment investment include: improving consumer and business confidence levels across economic sectors in the EU, improving domestic and export ordering levels, lower inflation limiting input cost pressures, lower interest rates and some easing in credit standards. Improving business fundamentals suggest that over the coming quarters pent-up demand may meaningfully recover.

Business
Overview
We are a leading European producer of engineering steel, with a focus on value add products for demanding engineering applications. We are headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, and have five main production facilities in Sweden and Finland, including three electric arc furnace ("EAF") melting facilities. We have three finishing facilities in France, Italy and the Netherlands and 15 sales offices across Europe and in the United States, Singapore and China.
We supply engineering steel products under our master brand "Ovako" and our five distinct product brands M-Steel, BQ-Steel, IQ-Steel, SZ-Steel and WR-Steel, which are based on leading application development, metallurgical expertise and production technology. We have more than 300 active feasible steel grades for making materials, of which 110 make up more than 80% of the volumes, across our three main production flows. Most of our sales volume can be categorized into our five product brands, which represent five types of engineering steel materials that we sell, each of which has its own specialized end uses. Our production facilities use these steel grades to produce more than 10,000 different hot-rolled or forged shapes for customers, 2,400 of which comprised approximately 80% of our volume in 2013.
We have a diversified client base with over 2,000 customers, many of which consist of long standing relationships with companies who are leaders in their end markets. We believe that one of the key benefits we offer our customers is working together with them to solve their particular engineering challenges. As our products are often specific to our customers' requirements we benefit from being the supplier through our customer's entire product cycle, which may be several years. Consequently we benefit from a high proportion of repeat customers, with approximately 97.5% of the volumes sold to our top 1,000 customers in 2013 purchased by repeat customers that had placed orders with us in 2012. We have had relationships with each of our top ten customers for at least nine years, seven of which we have had for more than 20 years. Our top ten customers represented 40% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. We supply our largest customers at several different assembly facilities across a number of different jurisdictions and end markets.
We operate in the engineering steel segment, a segment of the steel industry focused on mildly to highly alloyed steel. The engineering steel segment is a specialized sector within the broader general steel industry. Value is added to our products by providing them with specific qualities requested by clients. We produce engineering steel products for four main end markets: automotive and transportation, other engineering, mining and oil & gas, and energy production. The automotive and transportation and other engineering markets are our largest end markets, which we estimate accounted for approximately 40% and 30% of our total net sales in 2013, respectively. Our main geographic markets are Western Europe and the Nordics (Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway). In 2013, Western Europe (excluding the Nordics) and the Nordics accounted for 44.5% and 39.3%, respectively, of our total net sales, with Sweden and Germany together accounting for 52.1% of our total net sales.
We have been owned by Triton since 2010, during which time we have successfully managed through the recent market downturn in Europe. During the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, we generated total revenue of EUR875.6 million and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (as defined herein) of EUR74.0 million and sold 709 kt of steel. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we had an average of 3,001 full time equivalent employees worldwide.
Our strengths
Market leadership positions, strong reputation and attractive end markets
We are a European market leader in many of our core products and have market leadership positions in select niche applications. We are the largest, one of the largest, or in, in some cases, the only producer, of key specialized niche engineering steel product forms. For example, we have a leading position in a number of segments, such as bearings, and have the highest portion
97

of bearing steel volume of any European steel producer. We believe that we have built a reputation as a trustworthy, dynamic, customer-focused engineering steel expert through working closely with our customers to develop products. We believe there is a high degree of brand recognition of the "Ovako" brand which facilitates our sales and marketing efforts and provides a strong platform for new product and application launches. We believe our good reputation is shown by the long relationships we have maintained with certain key customers and the many repeat customers we had in 2013.
We believe that our leading market positions will allow us to benefit from growth prospects across the industrial segments we serve. We supply customers that operate across a range of end markets that we believe possess positive growth outlooks, such as the trucks and passenger vehicles and the yellow goods/construction equipment markets, which are expected to grow due to, among other things, increased construction activity on the back of economic recovery. We also expect the global oil & gas market to continue to grow due to an increase in exploration and production spending and the liberalization of off-shore exploration. We expect our energy production end market growth to be driven mainly by improvements in the technical performance of equipment, the replacement demand for aging power stations and anticipated regulatory changes.
High barriers to entry within the engineering steel industry
We believe that our position in the engineering steel segment is protected by high barriers to entry which include the need for geographic proximity to customers, the high degree of knowledge and customer access required to produce customer specific products, and the need for high quality products which benefits producers with high brand recognition. Customers' demand for specialized products in small batch sizes and just-in-time delivery means that it is important for a manufacturer of engineering steel to be close to its customers geographically, which creates a high barrier to entry for new European market entrants from the United States or Asia.
The high degree of specification of products in the engineering steel segment also creates a high barrier to entry due to the fact that many of our products have been developed especially for and with our customers. These customers may incur switching costs if they were to change their supplier of engineering steel products. We have developed our reputation over a long period of time, which we believe represents another high barrier to entry. Many of the products we supply to our customers are critical to their end products and they rely on the reputation of our brand for providing products that demonstrate durability, strength and susceptibility to extreme temperatures.
Flexible business set up across technical sales, production and logistics for small order volumes
We believe we have developed a flexible business set up that enables us to profitably produce complex products in small volumes. Customers also often require their engineering steel supplier's close proximity to their own production facilities in order to participate in the product engineering and design process and to reduce the risk of supply chain lags, as well as to maintain lower transportation costs. Our production facilities and finishing centers are all located in close proximity to many of our key customers, which we believe is a significant advantage. Our main production and research and development centers are located in Sweden and Finland while in 2013 the Nordics accounted for 39.3% of our net sales and Western Europe accounted for 44.5% of our net sales. We have built up a sales force in all our major markets with close proximity to our key customers, facilitating a shorter response time and direct access to our customers in their own language. We have an experienced employee base with what we believe to be exceptional product know-how, particularly in steel metallurgy and research and development generally. This enables us to work together with our customers to supply steel for demanding applications with important properties, such as fatigue life, machinability and low levels of micro inclusions for applications where clean steel is vital. For example, in January 2013, Patrik Olund, our head of R&D was awarded the prestigious Kami Prize for his contribution to the development of our IQSteel.
98

In addition to geographic proximity, we have invested in a flexible asset base that allows us to produce small volumes with fast lead times. We have designed our equipment, and in some cases made our own modifications, to make it easier for us to run short campaigns and short sequences. This enables us to quickly produce small batches of complex products for many customers. In certain instances our products are unique and enable cost savings in our customers' production processes or confer a longer life to their final products, which may outweigh logistics costs for potential customers located further from our production facilities. We believe many of our non-European customers purchase our products despite logistics costs and longer lead times because of the high degree of specification that we provide them.
Leading market positions in Western Europe with presence in the United States and Asia
We have a leading position in a number of segments, such as bearings, and have the highest portion of bearing steel volume of any European steel producer. We have a number of European competitors, however, few to none of those serve the same customer base with the same breadth of different grades and shapes. In 2013, Western Europe (excluding the Nordics) and the Nordics accounted for 44.5% and 39.3%, respectively, of our total net sales. Based on net sales, our main geographic markets are Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Finland, which accounted for 71.4% of our total net sales in 2013. Sweden and Germany together accounted for 52.1% of our total net sales in 2013. We believe that our leading market position in the Nordics and our foothold in Western Europe are a key advantage, particularly in Sweden and Germany as these markets tend to be more resilient following economic downturns, as demonstrated by the 3.7% and 4.0% increases in GDP in Sweden and Germany, respectively, during the period from 2010 to 2012 compared to the less than 2% increases in each of France, the United Kingdom and Finland during the same period. We also have a small but growing presence in Asia and an existing presence the United States to serve our local customers. Most of our customers in China and Asia were originally customers in another region, most often the Nordics or Western Europe, but we recently also acquired several new customers in China and in Asia.
Diversified group of loyal and well known customers
We have a diversified client base with over 2,000 customers, many of which are leaders in their end markets and their fields, some of whom we supply across a range of different geographic locations and end-markets. Our broad customer diversification helps to lower our reliance on any individual customer or end market. Our customers are loyal, as evidenced by our high proportion of repeat customers. Approximately 97.5% of volumes sold to our top 1,000 customers in 2013 were purchased by repeat customers that had placed orders with us in 2012. We believe our customer loyalty reflects high customer satisfaction. For example, in 2014 Bosch awarded us the title "Preferred Supplier" for the seventh year in a row.
In addition to building a diverse customer base, we have established and maintained long-term relationships with our top customers as evidenced by the fact that we have been doing business with each of our top ten customers for at least nine years and with seven of our top ten customers for more than 20 years. Our top ten customers accounted for 40% of our net sales in 2013. We have supplied several of our top ten customers across a number of their assembly and production locations in different geographies both in Europe and other regions. In addition, we supply products geared to a number of different end market segments to several of our top ten customers, which creates a further level of diversification within this group.
Well invested asset base with recent investments to drive cost efficiencies and future growth
We have invested significant capital over the last three years to expand our technological capabilities and product range, react to changes in market demand and address maintenance, environmental, health and safety requirements and surcharge expenses. Over the past three years, our capital expenditures included EUR7.6 million in connection with a new automated peeling line at our rolling mill Hllefors to expand our capacity to meet the demand for common
99

rail high pressure diesel injection systems, EUR7.6 million in connection with a new ring mill in Hofors to extend our product lines and cater for the increase we expect in the demand for large rings for power generation (including wind mills), EUR10.0 million in connection with the modernization of our tube mill in Hofors to reduce personnel, energy costs and improve yield, and EUR13.2 million in connection with a new state of the art de-dusting filter at our steel mill in Smedjebacken to meet future environmental regulations and to reduce the risk of business disruption. In addition, in July 2014 we intend to replace the continuous casting machine at our steel mill in Smedjebacken to reduce maintenance costs and support new growth opportunities, at a total expected capital expenditure of EUR14.0 million. In 2013, we also spent an additional EUR1.1 million on the acquisition of BE Group activities in China to support our customers in Asia with specific high-value products through sales and warehousing services. We believe that these investments, together with a number of other smaller strategic growth and cost savings investments made over the past three years position us to capture future growth opportunities and benefit from cost efficiencies.
Our total capital expenditure amounted to EUR33.5 million, EUR48.2 million and EUR44.9 million in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, of which EUR14.6 million, EUR21.0 million and EUR21.0 million, respectively, was attributable to expansion capital expenditure. As a result of our significant investments over the past three years, we expect our average annual capital expenditures going forward to be at lower levels than it has been in the past three years. We estimate that, in the medium term, our total capital expenditure will be between EUR25 million and EUR35 million per year, of which between approximately EUR15 million and EUR20 million per year is expected to be attributable to maintenance capital expenditure to maintain the current state of our operations.
Restructuring initiatives with lower cost base and increased business
Our management defined a strategy in 2011 setting out the steps to make Ovako more resilient in light of the recent economic downturn. This new strategy was based on the new market situation, with a focus on: (i) a long-term process improvement program to support profitability and reduce our break even point; (ii) an improvement in customer service to defend our market position and premium pricing; and (iii) the development of new volumes from new markets to decrease the impact of economic cycles. As a result of this strategy, we believe that we have become a more resilient business and reduced both our fixed costs, in particular costs in relation to our headcount and maintenance costs, and variable costs, in particular costs in relation to raw materials, energy and logistics. As a result of our cost reduction initiatives, our fixed costs decreased, on a constant currency basis, by EUR22.0 million, or 6.8%, from EUR325.0 million in 2011 to EUR303.0 million in 2013. This decrease was partly driven by our headcount reductions from 3,239 as of December 31, 2011 to 2,995 as of December 31, 2013, as production shifts at our steel mills were reduced and flexible work time agreements in Sweden and Finland were implemented. Our variable costs have decreased primarily as a result of reduced energy costs as a result of our new electricity price hedging policy, reduced transportation costs as a result of renegotiated transportation agreements in Eastern Europe and centralization and optimization of purchasing of supplies. In addition, we have taken steps such as broadening our geographic markets to lower the volatility of the past caused by macro-economic cycles. We believe the changes put in place by our management will serve as a foundation for continued recovery and an improved business portfolio.
Raw material cost pass through contracts supporting relatively stable Contribution margins
Raw materials accounted for 44.6%, 37.8% and 36.2% of our total cost of goods sold in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Steel scrap and alloys are the principal raw materials we use. Unlike most long product carbon steels, our engineering steel sales typically include scrap and alloy surcharge clauses, effectively passing on the raw material price to our customers. Our customer agreements with raw material price pass through typically allow us to adjust the scrap and alloy surcharge on a monthly basis. These frequent surcharge adjustments allow us to minimize the time lag for pass
100

through. We estimate that a significant majority of our sales volume in 2013 was subject to agreements that enable us to pass along price increases in scrap and alloys through a surcharge mechanism, which helps us to maintain our Contribution margin when the prices of these raw materials fluctuate. While the remaining sales volume is sold based on contracts which do not allow us to pass on increases of scrap and alloy prices to customers, we manage our exposure under these contracts by frequently renegotiating the prices on a monthly and quarterly basis, which allows us to set prices in accordance with our estimated raw material costs at the time the contracts are entered into. As a result of our carefully managed raw material cost pass-through, our exposure to raw materials price volatility is mitigated, which we believe is evidenced by our stable Contribution margin historically. We use Contribution, which we define as net sales less changes in inventories and work in progress, costs of raw materials and supplies, foreign exchange differences on purchased goods, energy costs and freight and distribution costs, and the Contribution margin, which we define as Contribution as a percentage of net sales, as a measure of the development of our sales prices compared to our direct variable costs. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, our Contribution margin was 39.7%, 39.4% and 40.3%, respectively and our Contribution margin for the three months ended March 31, 2014 Contribution margin was 43.5%.
Highly skilled and experienced management team
We believe we have a strong management team, led by our Chief Executive Officer Tom Erixon and supported by our Chairman of the Board Finn Johnsson, who joined Ovako in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The other members of our senior management team, Marcus Hedblom, Anders Henstrm, Gran Nystrm, Heikki Nyholm, Rickard Qvarfort, Mathias Tillman, Karin Lagerstedt Woolford and Carl-Michael Raihle, have an average of approximately 20 years of experience in steel and steel-related industries and an average of approximately 11 years experience with Ovako.
Our management has demonstrated an ability to manage our processes to efficiently create customized products specifically tailored to meet our customers' requirements. Our customers typically require their highly specialized products in relatively small volumes over many orders (average of 32 orders per customer per annum). These products are produced using more than 300 active feasible steel grades that can be formed into more than 10,000 variations of hot-rolled and forged shapes and several thousand combinations of value added services applied at finishing. With over 2,000 customers and an average volume of 300 tons per customer and an average of 108 thousand shipments per annum, we are set up to generate profits from small delivery volumes through an efficient and well managed production process. Management is currently in the process of implementing our 7P! program, which is a plan designed to further optimize growth, organization and processes.
Our strategy
Our aim is to create a long-term attractive position in the steel market by becoming the European leader in engineering steel, continuously developing our product offering and strengthening our customer relationships. We intend to be the premier manufacturer and supplier of engineering steel in Europe and to continue establishing our international position in selected niche areas. We believe this will be achieved by organic growth in our existing and new geographical markets, and through the evaluation of acquisitions and investments from time to time. We aim to maintain a highly reputable brand and supply world-class products based on leading application development, metallurgical expertise and production technology. We intend to develop our existing strengths toward our objective of becoming the most customer-oriented supplier of engineering steel. In this regard, we intend to continue to adapt our production processes to our customers' value chains, while offering our quality service and reliable delivery. In order to achieve our strategic objectives, we are prioritizing three areas: growth, efficient processes and increased coordination and economies of scale within our group ("One Ovako").
101

Pursue growth though improving our products and expanding our geographic markets
We plan to maintain organic growth through improvements to our existing materials used in our current applications in order to gain market share through the performance advantage of our products. For example, we are developing new steel grades under the BQ-Steel product brand to better serve our bearing steel customers, including our first bearing manufacturer in China. We also plan to enter into new applications to offer an alternative to competitors' materials in such applications, as we have successfully done in past with our IQ-Steel product brand and its use in diesel injection systems. This growth would be further supported by the continued integration of our internal processes and our customers' value chains and processes. We also aim to expand our presence in new geographical markets, such as Eastern Europe, the United States and China and Asia, by initially leveraging our relationships with key customers to establish ourselves in these markets and then attracting new customers. Most of our customers in China and in Asia were originally customers in another region, most often the Nordic countries or Western Europe, but we recently also acquired new customers in China and in Asia. We recently were awarded our first orders from local Chinese manufacturers. Through all of this we intend to maintain pricing that appropriately reflects the value of our materials and services.
Continue to implement more efficient processes in terms of purchasing, production and use of capital
We intend to continue to focus our efficiency improvement efforts on purchasing, operational efficiency and capital efficiency. We successfully reduced our freight and other distribution costs in 2013, in part due to the impact of lower transportation costs in Eastern Europe as a result of renegotiated transportation agreements, which became effective in late 2013. We have been able to pool the volumes of the group through our reorganized centralized purchasing function to take advantage of decreasing freight rates. We intend to continue to review our purchasing contracts to improve our terms and supplier performance. We have recently launched lean manufacturing programs at two of our sites with the intention of expanding the programs throughout the Group. We intend to realize growth without increasing inventories through more effective production planning and higher supplier performance.
Pursue increased coordination, centralize certain operations to take advantage of economies of scale and improve our competencies
In recent years, we have focused on increasing coordination between our different facilities and developing shared capacity, in order to increase efficiency and take advantage of economies of scale. For example, we have centralized our research and development, information technology, finance, sales, marketing, and purchasing functions. In addition, group functions have been improved, a common brand platform has been launched and a best-practice culture has been introduced, aimed at continuous development and improvement. We continue to seek to achieve a more flexible cost structure in order to be better equipped to respond to cyclical demand, while improving our functionality and competencies across all areas of our business, from purchasing to application development. We intend to continue to improve staff efficiency through removing redundancies and increasing competencies in certain key areas, particularly in the application development and research and development functions, to drive growth and pricing. Our customers typically require highly tailored products in relatively small volumes per order (9 tons per order on average). By providing special technical consultations to our customers and working closely with them to develop steel grades and product shapes that best suit their requirements, our customers become increasingly loyal to our products. Such products therefore typically have no standard market price and are difficult and costly to replace at short notice. We will also explore any options to further consolidate our current functions and operations to streamline our structure and improve efficiency.
102

Continue to implement our 7P! program
We are currently in the process of implementing our 7P! program which is aimed at improving profitability. Our 7P! program is how we plan to execute our strategies described above over the next three years. The main elements of our 7P! program are: (i) growth through our marketing plan for 2014; (ii) our pricing plan for 2014 targeting price increases; (iii) our new purchasing program; (iv) our functional improvement program targeting a net reduction in staff; (v) structural consolidation to reduce costs and increase efficiency; (vi) operational efficiency through cost down projects and continuous improvements to our processes; and (vii) capital efficiency by achieving growth without increasing our inventories.
Our history
Our history is built on a legacy of strong Nordic steel production. The forerunners to Ovako were founded over 300 years ago, when manufacturing began in Hofors, Sweden in the 17th century, followed by Boxholm and Hllefors in the 18th century, and by Smedjebacken in 1856.
During the 20th century the business has been transformed several times, resulting in the privately owned Ovako of today. From the beginning of the 1960s, the forerunners to Ovako gradually redirected their focus from commercial steel to complex engineering steel products. This development required investments in research, product development and quality control. The mills in Smedjebacken, Hofors and Imatra became significant suppliers of steel for the automotive and engineering industries. In 1969, the Finnish companies Oy Vuoksenniska Ab and Oy Fiskars Ab combined their steel production in a new company, Ovako Oy. In 1986, the group Ovako Steel was founded through a merger between SKF Steel and Ovako Oy. Ovako Steel was then split up after a few years, and SKF became the sole owner of the Swedish part of Ovako Steel in 1991, keeping the name Ovako Steel.
In May 2005, Ovako was established by merging Fundia, Ovako Steel and Imatra Steel. The company was jointly owned by Rautaruukki, SKF and Wrtsil, combining their long products steel businesses. In November 2006, Ovako was initially sold to Pampus Industrie Beteiligungen and a Dutch group of investors, with Pampus Stahlbeteiligungs acquiring sole ownership in November 2007.
In August 2010, private equity investor Triton acquired the bar, bright bar, tube and ring businesses of Ovako and formed the new Ovako AB, excluding the former wire division's operations.
Our brands
We supply engineering steel products, under our master brand "Ovako" and our five distinct product brands M-Steel, BQ-Steel, IQ-Steel, SZ-Steel and WR-Steel, which are based on leading application development, metallurgical expertise and production technology. Across our product brands, we offer a number of value adding services that can be applied to our products, including logistics-based customization to fit into customers' production lines, special properties bars, special profiles formed near to net shape, and quenching and tempering the steel to meet customers' specifications (see "--Our products" and "--Operations").
We have more than 300 active feasible steel grades for making materials, of which 110 make up more than 80% of the volumes. Most of our sales volume can be categorized into our five product brands, which represent five types of engineering steel materials that we sell, each of which has its own specialized end uses. The following chart summarizes our product brands, the characteristics and key customer benefits of the material type and examples of the end industries in which the materials are used:

M-Steel brand. M-Steel stands for "Machinability Steel". M-Steel is characterized by its improved material properties, tailored precision tolerance, and high consistency in each batch through our highly automated serial production process. In manufacturing, cutting processes are often a considerable cost factor. M-Steel may lower these costs by allowing higher cutting speeds (up to 30% over conventional steels) and a non-interrupted production environment. The M-Steels production processes are thoroughly controlled to achieve optimal cutting ability while maintaining impressive steel properties. The improved properties of M-Steel enables the machining of case hardened steel with CBN inserts at roughly double the speed previously possible, while reducing crater wear and improving the life of the cutting tool by 2-3 times. The ultra high consistency of our M-Steel bar means there is no need to change machine set-ups such as tools, feed rates or cutting fluid in automated serial production processes. M-Steel can help achieve significant reductions in machining costs for component manufacturers who have replaced conventional steel with M-Steel bar. M-Steel is primarily used by our customers in the mining, transportation and agriculture segments.
BQ-Steel brand. BQ-Steel stands for "Bearing Quality Steel". Our BQ-Steel has low contents of micro inclusions that enable components to resist higher stress levels and offer improved reliability in service, while remaining able to accommodate the latest design and technology advances. The material is available for producing highly stressed tube, bar, ring and wire, and all the main components needed for the manufacture of precision rolling bearings. We manufacture BQ-Steel with a precisely controlled steel making processes utilizing knowledge from our clean steel program. BQ-Steel is made of air melted steel for a homogenous structure and low levels of harmful micro inclusions. BQ-Steel is primarily used by our customers in the bearing, mining, transportation and agriculture segments.
IQ-Steel brand. IQ-Steel is our solution to the need for reliable components that can take the strain from higher and more complex load. IQ-Steel is characterized by a 40% increased fatigue strength, increased efficiency and weight reduction, in each case compared to traditional steels. Traditional steels are produced in a process where inclusions are crushed and elongated in the steel's rolling direction. As a result, they have poor fatigue and impact properties in the transverse rolling direction. IQ-Steel is produced in a process that eliminates most inclusions, resulting in clean steel with isotropic properties, meaning that it performs equally in all directions. Our IQ-Steel is primarily used to produce components for demanding applications in the automotive and transport segment (e.g., in diesel injection systems) and in the power generation segment by the wind power industry, but the steel is versatile and we are developing other applications together with customers.
SZ-Steel brand. SZ-Steel stands for "Sub-Zero Steel". SZ-Steel is used in many safety critical applications in some of the most inhospitable environments, such as those found in the extreme northern and southern hemispheres. It is used significantly in exposed locations on pipelines in the mining and oil & gas segment as well as fixing bolt, fasteners and stud bolts where they are expected to be exposed to low temperatures. The SZ-Steel process produces a steel that exhibits a variety of crucial properties at low temperatures, such as hardness and impact strength, wear resistance and dimensional stability. Unlike standard grades, SZ-Steel reduces risks of brittle fracture at extremely low temperatures and is more resistant to corrosion. This reduces the risk of equipment failures and subsequent plant downtime in harsh conditions and can save costs including reduced maintenance. SZ-Steel is primarily used by our customers in the mining, transportation and agriculture segments.
WR-Steel brand. WR-Steel stands for "Wear Resistant Steel". WR-Steel describes steels we have developed based on our experience in boron grades and quenching and tempering processes. WRSteel utilizes excellent yield and tensile strength and greatly improved wear resistance for demanding environments. The Boron alloying in WR-Steel, even in small qualities, significantly increases hardenability, allowing lower contents of carbon and other alloying elements. WR-Steel is widely used in varied high demanding wear applications from yellow goods/construction equipment to agricultural, forestry and off-road vehicles. WR-Steel is used for components that are exposed abrasive conditions, such as snowplows, excavator teeth, and wheel chains for forestry equipment.

Our products

In the engineering steel segment, customers do not order standard products, but rather they approach us with an engineering idea that then requires the collaboration between the client and our sales and engineering team to identify the grade of material and product shape and finishing that best meets the customers requirements, based on the customer's production process and the product's end use. See and "--Customers" and "Industry". Because we produce over 10,000 different rolled or forged shapes and can apply several thousand combinations of value added services to those shapes to meet the needs of our customers, our products are best categorized by material, format and finishing.

We have more than 300 active feasible steel grades for making materials, of which 110 make up more than 80% of the volumes, across our three main production flows (Hofors-Hallefors, Smedjebacken-Boxholm and Imatra) (see "--Operations--Ovako's production flow"). As described above, most of our sales volumes may be sold under our five product brands. Our production facilities use these steel grades to produce more than 10,000 different rolled or forged shapes for customers, 2,400 of which comprised approximately 80% of our volume in 2013. Additionally, we offer several thousand different combinations of value added services options to our customers through the operations of our different facilities, including, heat treatment, turning, grinding, cutting, warehousing and transportation, and finished product and logistics-based tailoring of products to fit the start of our customers' production processes.

Format range. Our five main production facilities (of which three are facilities with on-site EAFs and rolling/forging mills, and two are rolling or forging mills without on-site EAFs) and six processing facilities allow us to cover an extensive format range. We can therefore provide most formats common to engineering steel. Our strategy of focusing on highly specialized products has lead to recent success such as deliveries to Indonesia and Malaysia and recently our first orders from a domestic Chinese manufacturer who seeks to benefit from the high quality that Ovako's products bring in these specialized applications.

Finishing. We offer several thousand combinations of value added services, including peeling, grinding, chroming, cutting, annealing, quenching and tempering, cold-drawing, pilgering and testing. We can optimize our customers' products to a very fine degree. In addition to producing materials that meet the specifications for our customers' applications, through our forging and rolling processes and value added services, we are able to produce highly customized finished products that are tailored to fit into our customers' production processes, which increases efficiency and may decrease our customers' costs.
Customers
We have a diversified client base with over 2,000 customers, many of which consist of long standing relationships with companies who are leaders in their end markets. We are focused on a broad range of end markets with attractive growth prospects, including automotive and transport, other mechanical engineering, mining and oil & gas, and energy production. We believe that approximately 85% of our net sales are made through direct sales to customers in these end markets, with the remaining portion made through third party distributors (see "-- Operations" and "--Distribution"). Our customers in the automotive and transport segment include original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") as well as suppliers to OEMs. Our customers in other engineering sector include heavy industrial equipment manufacturers and bearing manufacturers. Our customers in the energy production segment include wind energy companies and our customers in the mining and oil & gas segment include mining equipment OEMs and equipment manufacturers for offshore applications.
We often provide special technical consultations to our customers and regularly develop new products or services in collaboration with our customers. In addition, we work closely with OEMs, even where our direct customer is an intermediary in the supply chain, as well as other producers contributing products to an OEM's end product, to coordinate the various steps in the supply chain and ensure uniform quality and consistency of our products and their interaction with other components within the supply chain.
Our customers typically require highly specialized products in relatively small volumes per order. Our products are often used by our customers in demanding applications or harsh environments and are difficult and costly to replace at short notice. For example, many of our products require significant testing and certification for use by customers. Our close customer relationships, level of service and product customization to our customers' requirements contribute to a competitive offering and create a degree of customer lock-in effect. Additionally, we understand that many of our customers are party to multi-year production programs in their respective end markets. We believe the customized nature of our products, the fact that many of our customers are party to multi-year production contracts, and the difficulty for our customers to switch to different suppliers at short notice have helped us maintain long-term customer relationships. We have a high proportion of repeat customers, with approximately 97.5% of the volumes sold to our top 1,000 customers in 2013 being purchased by repeat customers that had placed orders with us in 2012.
Our largest customers are also some of our longest standing customers, as we have had relationships with each of our top ten customers for at least nine years, seven of which we have had for more than 20 years. We use these longstanding relationships with multi-national customers to increase our deliveries outside Europe, expanding from deliveries to Sweden and Germany, to sales in Eastern Europe, the United States, China and Southeast Asia. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our top ten customers represented 40% of our net sales, with our largest customer representing 15% of our net sales. We believe the concentration risk of having one such large customer is mitigated by this diversification of supply across several industry and regional cycles.
We have yearly contracts and quarterly contracts, as well as some semi-annual contracts. The most important contract term relate to the base price, which is subject to adjustments based on scrap and alloy surcharge agreements at delivery). The production under our contracts is largely
107

order driven (i.e., firm orders, regularly updated customer forecasts and fixed or agreed lead times). The short term nature of our production contracts and the fact that our production cycle is typically significantly shorter than three months provides us with visibility and reduces our risk of excess inventory. This risk is further reduced by the fact that our customers' production lead times are often longer than our own production lead times.

Operations
We manufacture engineering steel products, adding value for our customers at each step in our production chain, from raw material selection to finishing.

Engineering steel production process

Our engineering steel production can be broadly broken down into five process steps: scrap collection and selection, metallurgy (EAF melting, ladle furnace treatm ent ("LFT") and vacuum degassing), casting/soaking, hot rolling or forging and finishing. Steel products are commonly divided into two categories: flat and long products. W e produce engineering steel products which fall into a subcategory within long steel products. The chart below shows an overview of how our engineering steel production compares to typical carbon steel production:

Scrap collection and selection. Unlike the carbon steel industry, which uses iron ore, melted down
in blast furnaces powered by coal, in the engineering steel industry we rely primarily on specially selected scrap metal, which is supplemented by separately purchased alloys to produce the correct combination of elements when melting down the metal to produce our steel. The key activities for this stage of the process are sourcing, collecting and sorting the scrap metal in order to prepare each melt in a scrap basket. Using our metallurgical expertise, we are able to determine the alloy content and fragmentation of different scrap categories to ensure the proper mix in a given melt.
Metallurgy (EAF melting, LFT and vacuum degassing). Once the scrap has been selected, all our
production flows begin at one of our three electric arc furnaces (EAFs) located in Hofors, Imatra and Smedjebacken. Primary metallurgy is the production of a basic melt at one of our EAFs. Our use of an EAF based platform allows us to operate a flexible business model, which can react rapidly to changing customer demands and macroeconomic conditions. Our mills can be shut down and restarted with relatively low restart and maintenance costs compared to blast furnaces

108

in the carbon steel industry which typically require continuous production and greater relative maintenance capital expenditures. Our EAF technology is based on the recycling of scrap material, which reduces our direct exposure to iron and coal prices while providing environmental benefits compared to blast furnaces.
After melting the scrap, we optimize the grade specification by adding alloys and degassing the liquid steel. LFT treatment of the melted steel occurs in a ladle furnace, controlling for temperature and adding alloying elements. We use vacuum degassing in Hofors and Imatra, which is a process to remove impurities from the melt. The addition of alloys and degassing processes are used to produce differing product attributes, driven by the chemical composition of the melt. The value added at this step by Ovako is our ability to optimize the final product performance. In particular, we have an ability to limit inclusions for superior product (fatigue) properties.
Casting and soaking. After refining the liquid steel during the metallurgy step, the steel is solidified, either into ingots or through continuous casting or into billets or blooms. This is essentially casting liquid steel into semi-finished products at a controlled temperature. We use our knowledge of how different casting processes and sequences impact product performance and process efficiency. For our IQ-Steel and BQ-Steel product brands, a soaking period is then implemented to reach the required properties.
Hot rolling or forging. After the material is once again solid steel, whether in the form of billets, blooms or ingots, it then undergoes hot forming as a next step, either by rolling in a rolling mill or forging in a forging mill. Special microstructures (supported by chemical composition) can be flexibly adjusted by heat treatment of various kinds (under different atmospheres, at different temperature regimes, and duration) and during thermo-mechanically controlled rolling/forging. We use these processes to produce the sizes and shapes desired by the customer (see generally "--Our products"). Due to our experience and knowledge, we are able to minimize energy consumption through efficient processes limiting the amount of re-heating required.
Finishing. Using our knowledge of our customers' processes and the intended end use for our products, we produce finished products that are tailored to be incorporated directly into the start of our respective customers' processes, and that aim to increase our customers' efficiency and reduce their costs.

Ovako's production flow

Our manufacturing is traditionally based on three production flows: Hofors-Hallefors, Smedjebacken-Boxholm and Imatra. Together, these production flows enable us to offer and produce our valuable and competitive offering of products. Our operations are described based on the following three productions flows:

As our manufacturing begins at one of the three production flows: Hofors-Hllefors, Smedjebacken-Boxholm or Imatra. Operations and production at these steel mills differ somewhat with regard to products and customers.
Hofors-Hllefors. The Hofors-Hllefors production flow begins at our EAF at Hofors facility and continues at either our Hofors or Hllefors facilities. Hofors-Hllefors produces heavy bar and medium bar products for our customers. Hofors-Hllefors produces our IQ-Steel, which due to its cleanliness, is demanded by manufacturing industries such as the automotive industry in diesel injection systems. Most of Hofors-Hllefors' customers are in the automotive and transportation segment (bearing, heavy trucks and passenger vehicle sub-segments), the energy production segment and other engineering segment (manufacturing industries). Our tube and ring production is carried out at our Hofors facility, using products produced by the rolling mills and forging facilities located at Hofors.
We have implemented a number of important investments and initiatives during the period 2011-2013. In 2013 we inaugurated a new automated peeling line in Hllefors with the aim of maintaining long-term growth in the attractive product segment for diesel injection and to increase the degree of value added services we can offer. In March 2013, installation of the fifth ring mill in Hofors was completed to meet increased demand for bearing rings in larger sizes (up to four meters in diameter) so that we can meet the increased demand for bearing steel for very large bearings, which, among other things, are used in offshore windmills. In Hofors, an extensive modernization of the tube works to reduce cost and support new business opportunities in Europe had also begun in 2013, and the expected completion by the end of 2015 is one of several important steps in the upgrade of our productions.
Smedjebacken-Boxholm. The Smedjebacken-Boxholm production flow begins at our EAF in Smedjebacken, thereafter continuing the process at Smedjebacken or continuing on to our Boxholm facility. The Smedjebacken-Boxholm production flow is focused on cost-efficient production of engineering steels, with a focus on boron-alloyed steels and micro-alloyed steels that together account for approximately two-thirds of the Smedjebacken-Boxholm production volume. Boron steel is used in applications where wear resistance is very important, such as for snow ploughs, cutting steel, fork-lifts and agricultural machinery. The mill at Boxholm also produces a small quantity of engineering steel, the value of which is created through advanced rolling for specific applications that require steel with very high tolerances (special properties bar, or SP-bar).
Smedjebacken-Boxholm is diversified across a number of customers within the automotive and transport, other engineering and mining and oil & gas segments. Product development is continuing within these segments and new applications are being developed. We roll most of our spring steel in Smedjebacken, while our plant in Boxholm focuses on specialty products. Both rolling mills at Smedjebacken and Boxholm produce flat and round bars. In particular, special properties and special profiles bars are produced in Boxholm. Eastern Europe and Russia have been identified as key growth markets for Smedjebacken-Boxholm.
Recently, we have made a number of investments at our facilities in Smedjebacken. During 2013, the final installation of our new de-dusting filter was completed at Smedjebacken. We estimate the flow capacity of the new de-dusting plant will be approximately 40% higher than it was previously. In addition, we believe that energy consumption will decline by approximately 4,500 MWh per year due mainly to its energy-efficient design and choice of components. We believe this will also correspond to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 2,400 tons per year from power generation based on fossil fuels. The filter meets future environmental standards and is one of many steps toward ensuring a good working environment for our employees and minimizing our environmental footprint. As part of our continued investment and strategic focus on growth, we have decided to invest in a new continuous casting machine in Smedjebacken, with the existing continuous casting facilities being replaced over the next two years. The first phase of the project is scheduled for commissioning in August 2014.

Imatra. A large part of the Imatra production flow is oriented towards customers who make forged high-precision parts for applications in the mining, offshore drilling and the heavy automotive industries. In these segments, Imatra develops engineering steel adapted to particularly demanding forging applications with the high standards for steel properties that customers require. Imatra's customers consist mainly of Nordic automotive, forging and engineering industries, but the rest of Europe, Asia, North America and Russia are important growth regions. In particular, Imatra produces our M-Steel products.
Our facilities
We operate a European production base and a number of strategically located distribution centers. We are headquartered in Stockholm Sweden. We have five main production facilities located in Hofors, Hllefors, Smedjebacken and Boxholm, Sweden and Imatra Finland. Our EAFs are located at our Hofors, Smedjebacken and Imatra facilities. We also have processing facilities in Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, France and Italy. We own all of our facilities. The proximity of our facilities and operations to most of our key customers provides us with superior reactivity and readiness in responding to clients' needs and requests. Our current production capacity is approximately 1.3 million tons of liquid steel per annum, of which we can produce approximately 1.1 million tons per annum of rolled products.

We also currently have a Cromax bright bar processing facility in Mora, Sweden, but this facility will cease operations in 2014.

Distribution

We focus on direct sales to our customers, using third party distributors to complete our reach to certain target customers. For the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 85% of our sales were made directly to our customers, with the remaining approximately 15% accounting for third party distributors.

D ir e c t sa les. W e can deliver orders in a relatively short time frame and lower our transportation costs by being located close to many of our customers. In the year ended December 31, 2013, most of our deliveries were made by truck. W e reduce our distribution costs by selling directly to the end-markets through our own sales network. For the year ended December 31, 2013, 93.0% of our sales were to customers in Eastern Europe, Western Europe and the Nordics.

We have dedicated local sales forces in each of our key demographic markets, which consist of dedicated sales teams and local engineering resources. This enables us to have direct interaction with customers and provide our customers with access to a dedicated application development team. We also appoint key account managers for multi-product and multi-location customers to provide them with a central interface. We believe in profit accountability at the geographic market level, and the sales unit manager in each such market is responsible for our total business within that market. Our total sales-force for the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of 95 full time employees. The following table shows the breakdown of our sales-force by geography.

Notes: (1) Excluding sales force located at the mills in Sweden.
For the year ended December 31, 2013, our total net sales represented an average volume of 300 tons per customer, 32 orders per customer and 9 tons per order, which were distributed through approximately 108 thousand shipments with an average volume of 9 tons per shipment.
Distributor channels. We use distributors in the Nordic markets where we already have a high share of the market and in limited instances where we are trying to grow in new geographies. Distributors represented approximately 5% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. Tibnor is a key third party distributor for Ovako products within some Nordic markets and represented the largest contributor to our distributor revenues and 7% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. Tibnor is a subsidiary of SSAB and is the largest steel distributor in the Nordics. In 2013, Tibnor had reported total sales of SEK 5,245 million, of which SEK50 million comprised internal sales to SSAB. We believe more than three quarters of Tibnor's shipments take place within Sweden. Tibnor accounts for approximately one-third of the distributors' market share in Sweden, according to SSAB. We believe we are the main supplier of long product engineering steels to Tibnor, but Tibnor does not have any exclusive right to distribute our products generally or to any specified customers.
Raw materials and energy
Our products are primarily manufactured from steel scraps and alloy.
Scrap metals and alloys. Our products are primarily manufactured from steel scraps and alloys. All our alloy inputs and most of our scrap inputs are sourced from external suppliers on short-term contracts. We source a small amount of scrap steel through recycling from our production facilities in Hofors and Smedjebacken, but this amount is limited due to the efficiency of our production processes.
We purchase our scrap from regional suppliers to reduce transport costs. In Sweden, Stena Recycling is the largest supplier of scrap metal. Sweden exports approximately 50% of its scrap metal, with most of the remaining domestic scrap sold into the JBF clearing system. JBF acts as a clearing house and sets the prices for the Swedish market, which reflect the global prices. The JBF clearing system handles scrap purchases on behalf of Ovako as well as other companies, such as Outokumpu, Sandvik, SSAB and Uddeholm, resulting in the scrap repurchase costs being shared efficiently across the Swedish steel industry.
The scrap market in Finland is slightly different than the Swedish market as it has a lower surplus of scrap. In Finland, Kuusakoski Oy is the largest supplier of scrap metal. In the last three years, Ovako Imatra Oy Ab has sourced its scrap from Finnish domestic suppliers.
We secure our supply of alloys from several sources, including global mining conglomerates. The majority of our alloys are purchased pursuant to yearly contracts, with the remainder purchased on a quarterly basis. Prices of alloys are typically tied to external spot prices reported on a reputed exchange, as set forth in the contract. See "Management's discussion and analysis o f financial condition and results o f operations--Key factors affecting our results o f operations-- Pricing o f engineering steel products" for further information regarding our supply of scrap and alloy.
Energy. The production of our products is very energy-intensive. Our largest energy related expenses are for electricity, liquefied petroleum gas, fuel oil and natural gas. See "Management's discussion and analysis o f financial condition and results o f operations--Key factors affecting our results o f operations--Electricity, gas, fuel oil and other energy costs" for further information regarding our use and supply of energy.

Research and development
Our main production and research and development centers are located in Sweden and Finland. We have a centralized research and development function that works in close cooperation with our key customers. The development of M-Steel and IQ-Steel are some examples of the outcomes of such collaboration. IQ-Steel is a steel used in applications that contribute to reduced environmental impact and lower CO2 emissions, which has received particular attention. In January 2013, Patrik Olund, Ovako's head of research and development was awarded the prestigious Kami Prize for his contribution to the development of this steel. Product development is an ongoing process. In 2012, for example, variants of IQ-Steel were customized to meet new specific customer needs.

Intellectual property
We pursue a trademark strategy that involves the development of our attribute brands that we actively seek to protect. In addition, we maintain an intellectual property portfolio of our issued and pending patents and seek to register patents for certain new products and processes as they are developed and technology.

Employees

As at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 we had 2,973 and 2,995 full time equivalent employees, respectively. The following table sets forth our average number of employees by country for 2013.

Due to our highly technical and specialized production processes, our employees are required to complete training in operations and technical functions. We believe we enjoy good relations with our employees and a high employee retention rate, in part due to the training and development that we provide.
In certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to collective bargaining agreements negotiated between unions and our representatives at the national or sectorial level and made mandatory pursuant to national labor law. Over the past three years, we have not experienced any significant industrial relations problems recently nor are we party to any material pending labor proceedings.

We place an emphasis on the development of steel that contributes to lower use of resources, as sustainability is important to us. Efforts to develop stronger and more environmentally friendly materials result in less energy-demanding products, which ultimately have a positive environmental effect. The production facilities of the Group employ either environmental management systems or risk-based management systems that are designed to assist in avoiding spills and other incidents. The environmental management systems of the Group are monitored using both internal and external audits at regular intervals. W e conduct our business with a focus on improving steel quality and providing solutions that mitigate environmental impact. However, greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption represent the most significant environmental aspects of our business and are both a priority to reduce. We must continually make investments to minimize the impact on the environment in order to make sure that we comply with increasingly strict legislation and the requirements of our customers. For example, in 2013, we completed the installation of a new de-dusting system in 2013 at our Smedjebacken facility to comply with pending environmental standards.
Recycling o f scrap-based steel and other by-products. Steel is a material that can be reused a
number of times without deterioration. No new iron ore needs to be mined for our steel production. With our three scrap-based steel mills, we believe us to be an important part of the recycling industry, using approximately one million tons of scrap metal every year. Our w ell functioning cooperation with scrap agents assures we receive raw material that, through our skills in metallurgy, is melted and transformed into new engineering steel products.
Today not only is scrap metal recycled, but also waste and residual products, mainly iron oxides, from our production processes are used as raw materials in other products. We have managed to develop a market for by-products deriving from our manufacturing processes, thereby reducing the need for waste disposal and landfills.
ISO 14001. Our major production facilities and steel mills are certified according to ISO 14001,
which establishes standards for environmental impact and toward continuous environmental improvements. Every year, environmental impact targets are set for the individual business areas. Discharge from the production processes are regularly measured and reported to the authorities.
World Steel's Sustainable Development Charter. We have signed the World Steel's Sustainable
Development Charter, which means we support the sustainable development policy established in 2002 by the World Steel Association.
Conflict minerals. W e are committed to sourcing responsibly and are dedicated to avoiding
mining activities that fuel conflicts in mining regions. Our efforts related to conflict minerals are aligned with the work of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and Global eSustainability Initiative (GeSI).

Environmental, health and industrial safety work. We strive to provide attractive workplaces for our employees and contribute to a long-term sustainable society. We encourage all our employees to take the environment, health and safety into account in their daily activities. EHS issues also need to be considered when we buy products and services.
Environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulation
All our production operation facilities are located within the European Union, in particular Sweden and Finland. Our production operations are subject to a range of EHS laws and regulations, including those relating to air and water emissions water usage, waste management, including hazardous and toxic waste contamination and the cleanup of contamination. Additionally, we are subject to regulations on product safety as well as work health and safety.
We are required to regularly obtain and maintain various permits from governmental authorities in order to conduct our business operations. The following provides a brief summary of some key EHS requirements that apply to our operations with particular focus on the laws applicable in the European Union. It should be noted that laws and regulations not discussed below may also apply.
General regulatory framework. Our production depends on a number of EU Directives and Regulations pertaining to EHS. Directive 2008/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of January 15, 2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (as amended, the "IPPC Directive;" original directive approved in 1996), requires EU member states to unify their environmental licensing regimes relating to limiting emissions from industrial installations. The IPPC Directive aims to minimize the amount of emissions originating from different sources throughout the EU. From October 2007, industrial installations have been required to have national emission permits that are based on the use of best available techniques ("BATs"). The IPPC Directive applies to both new and existing installations. Most of our production facilities in the EU have had to apply for an integrated environmental permit under the IPPC IE Directive, which applies common rules for permitting and controlling industrial installations. To receive a permit, installations covered by IPPC rules must apply BATs and comply with BAT-Associated Emissions Levels, as adopted in the BAT conclusions by the European Commission, to optimize their overall environmental performance. Emissions to air, soil or water, as well as noise and safety are all covered by the IE Directive. The directive maintains limited flexibility for competent authorities for deviating from the use of BATs, such deviations may only be made pursuant to robust justifications that stand up to EU scrutiny. The directive will also lead to a rolling program of redefinition, review and update of the BATs and the related emission levels. Industrial operators are required to achieve compliance with any changes in BATs within four years of an update. It is likely that the implementation of the IE Directive and respective updates of environmental permits will require us to invest in additional emission reduction measures and modify our operations in one or more of our production facilities in Europe. These processes are expected to be ongoing for many years and continue on a rolling basis pursuant to future updates of BATs. The IE Directive will also result in a stricter environmental oversight of our production facilities, particularly regarding atmospheric emissions. Sweden implemented the IE Directive on June 18, 2013 by amendments to the Swedish Environmental Act and by passing six new regulations. Finland is still in the process of implementing the IE Directive and is expected that the IE Directive be implemented during 2014. Because our operations involve significant air emissions, new or revised permit requirements in the future could result in significant additional investments and costs.
Administrative proceedings and permit applications. Pursuant to the Finnish Environmental Protection Act (Fi. Ymparistonsuojelulakf) and the Swedish Environmental Act (Sw. Miljobalken), our Swedish and Finnish companies hold environmental permits which set forth limits and directions on our water and air emissions, the storage of raw materials and chemicals, noise levels, waste handling and reporting requirements. The Finnish companies hold the following main environmental permits for their operations which are granted for an indefinite period: Environmental Permit (currently subject to re-assessment; and environmental permit for a noise barrier (application for re-assessment to be submitted by the Finnish companies by September 30, 2018. The Swedish companies hold the
116

following main environmental permits for their operations which are granted for an indefinitve period: environmental permit for operations, Ovako Bar AB (Smedjebacken) (currently subject to reasessment), environmental permit for operations, Ovako Bar AB (Boxholm), environmental permit for operations, Ovako Sweden AB (Hofors) (application for re-assessment to be submitted by August 2014), environmental permit for operations, Ovako Sweden AB (Hllefors) and an environmental permit for operations, Ovako ForsbackaAB. Pursuant to these permits, both our Swedish and Finnish companies are subject to regular inspections by regulators.
Emission Trading Schemes. Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowances trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (as amended, the "ETS Directive"), which entered into force on October 25, 2003. Allowances traded in the ETS are held in accounts in electronic registries set up by member states, which are overseen by a central administrator at EU level, the ETS Directive was amended in April 2009 by Directive 2009/29/EC.
For the period after 2012, the EU institutions adopted the CEP, which aims to reduce the community's greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, as compared to 1990 levels, and 30% if other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emission reductions and economically more advanced developing countries contribute adequately according to their responsibilities and capabilities on December 17, 2008.
In particular, the amended ETS Directive includes centralized allocation rather than national allocation plans, a cap on the overall number of allowances designed to achieve an overall reduction of greenhouse gases for the ETS sectors of 21% in 2020 as compared to the 2005 emission cap and auctioning as the basic principle for allocating emission allowances, with transitional free allocation based on benchmarks for manufacturing industries with a significant risk of carbon leakage. However, it is expected that the market price for allowances will increase. Through Commission Decision 2010/2/EU of December 24, 2009, the manufacturing of, inter alia, steel and ferroalloys has been recognized as having a significant risk of carbon leakage. On December 15, 2010, the EU Climate Change Committee adopted a draft decision determining transitional EU-wide rules for the harmonized free allocation of emission allowances. This draft was slightly amended and adopted as EU Commission Decision (2011/278/EU) on April 27, 2011, which, among other things, determines the benchmark values for the steel industry. The values adopted are lower than those proposed by the European steel industry and will lead to significant additional cost for steel companies in Europe. Ovako Sweden (Hofors) are planning to invest in a new dedusting filter to meet the new requirements, at an estimated cost of EUR1.0 million. Another regulation relating to the auctioning of greenhouse gas emission allowances recently went into effect, completing the EU's legislative framework in this area (Commission Regulation (EU) No. 1031/2010 of November 12, 2010 on the timing, administration and other aspects of auctioning of greenhouse gas emission allowances pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowances trading within the Community, as amended). On July 25, 2012, the Commission adopted a proposal for an amendment of the auctioning rules that would entitle the Commission to adapt the auction timetable. With such an adaptation, the Commission could significantly affect the availability of emission allowances available, which would probably result in an increase of the market price for emission allowances.
We currently qualify for a free allocation of emission allowances between 2013 and 2020 by being part of an industry sector that has a significant risk of carbon leakage. The free allowances may not be sufficient to cover all allowances needed for the operations of the Group. We may have to purchase emission rights in addition to those they will obtain free of charge, which could result in additional costs. Additional decisions in the future by the EU Commission, including with respect to maintaining or extending carbon leakage protections applicable to us, also could result in significant new obligations.
Air emissions. Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 21, 2008 on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe establishes a system for the assessment of ambient air quality in relation to sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen,
117

particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), lead, benzene, carbon monoxide and ozone. Directive 2004/107/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 15, 2004 relating to arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air (as amended, the "Fourth Daughter Directive") follows similar directives in the field of air quality dating back to the original Council Directive 96/62/EC of September 27, 1996 on ambient air quality assessment and management (as amended, the "Air Quality Framework Directive"). The Fourth Daughter Directive sets limit values for polyaromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, nickel, cadmium and mercury in ambient air. It completes the list of pollutants initially described in the Air Quality Framework Directive by defining target values for all pollutants with the exception of mercury, for which only monitoring requirements are specified.
Directive 2001/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 23, 2001 on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants (as amended, the "NEC Directive") has been adopted in line with the 1997 communication concerning the strategy to combat acidification, which sought to establish, for the first time, national emission ceilings for certain pollutants. The NEC Directive leaves it largely to each EU member state's discretion to decide which measures (in addition to EU legislation for specific source categories) to take in order to comply with the NEC Directive. The proposal to amend the NEC Directive is still under preparation and should set emission ceilings to be respected by 2020 for the four already regulated substances and for the primary emissions of PM2.5 as well.
There have been incidents on the sites of the Finnish Group companies that have resulted in air emission levels exceeding the permitted levels. However, the environmental authorities were informed of these events and none of these events resulted in material consequences. There are no outstanding violations that the Company believes will result in material consequences in the future.
Water quality standards. Directive 2008/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 16, 2008 on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy, amending and subsequently repealing Council Directives 82/176/EEC, 83/513/EEC, 84/156/EEC, 84/491/EEC and 86/280/EEC and amending Directive 2000/60/EC (as amended, the "Environmental Quality Standards Directive"). The Directive sets out environmental quality standards concerning the presence in surface water of certain pollutants and substances or groups of substances identified as priority on account of the substantial risk they pose to or through the aquatic environment. The priority substances are defined by Directive 2000/60/EC (as amended, the "Water Framework Directive"), which establishes a list of 33 priority substances. Twenty priority substances are classed as hazardous. The environmental quality standards are limits to the degree of concentration (i.e., the quantity in water of the substances concerned must not exceed certain thresholds). The quality standards are differentiated for inland surface waters (rivers and lakes) and other surface waters (transitional, coastal and territorial waters). Specific standards are also set for metals and certain other substances. At this stage it is difficult to accurately predict the impact of these ongoing EU initiatives for water protection on our operations; however, it is expected that the main critical compounds would be chrome, nickel and zinc. A review of the list of priority substances in the field of water policy is ongoing. The Commission has adopted a proposal for a new directive that would amend the Water Framework Directive and the Environmental Quality Standards Directive as regards priority substances in the field of water policy.
Engineering steel production involves high-temperature processes with extensive cooling requirements. To protect personnel and manufacturing equipment, we use water for cooling. Water is used both to cool steel surfaces through direct contact and indirectly through heat exchangers and cooling systems.
From an environmental perspective, the most significant components in water discharged from the manufacturing processes of the Group are metal compounds.
In October 2013, a leakage of cooling water from the vacuum degassing of the steel plant ladle furnace occurred at Ovako Sweden AB's site in Hofors. According to Ovako Sweden AB's estimation, approximately 300-600 kilos of zinc and 30-60 kilos of lead leaked out during 2013. No material costs or penalties are however anticipated in relation to this.
118

Contamination. Under the respective national legislation, the liabilities for soil and groundwater contamination may be imposed not only on the owner of the contamination source, but also on other parties such as the former owner or the party having control of the premises at a relevant time. Thus, it cannot be entirely excluded that we may be affected by such liabilities, even regarding sites formerly owned or operated by us.
Some of our production sites have been used in large-scale metal industry operations for long periods of time, which increases the likelihood that historical contamination exists at these production sites. Historical contamination may cause clean-up obligations in case the purpose for which the land is used changes or in case excavations are performed in areas where such historical contamination exists. Soil contamination has been identified on some of our sites. Remediation costs do not constitute a significant portion of the Finnish Group companies' overall costs for environmental activities. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at these or other sites in the future could result in significant additional costs, however. In addition, Ovako Sweden AB are responsible for conducting remediation at a closed landfill site. The remediation process has been ongoing since 2008 and is expected to be completed in 2019. The remaining costs are estimated at EUR4.6 million.
Environmental liability. With the Directive 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 21, 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, a framework for environmental liability was established based on the "polluter pays" principle, to prevent and remedy environmental damage. Environmental damage is defined as pollution of water, damage to biodiversity and land contamination that causes considerable harm to human health. Operators of activities that cause environmental damage can be obliged to restore the damage caused, or to pay for restoration, irrespective of whether they are responsible for the environmental damage.
Under the Swedish Environmental Act, the polluter is primarily responsible for remedying pollution to groundwater or soil. However, if the polluter cannot be determined or found or is unable or neglects to carry out its clean-up obligations, the current owner of the contaminated site can be held liable for reasonable remedial measures if the owner knew, or should have known, about the contamination, or if the owner consented to the polluting activity. Additionally, the Swedish Environmental Act establishes a compensatory damages regime for personal injuries, damage to property and in certain cases for financial losses sustained from pollution of water, air or soil as well as from noise, vibrations, radiation, light, heat, odor or from other similar nuisances. Furthermore, the act regulates compensation for clean-up costs as well as preventive and remediation measures.
Under the Finnish Environmental Protection Act (Fi. Ymparistonsuojelulaki), the polluter is primarily responsible for remedying pollution to groundwater or soil. However, if the polluter cannot be determined or found or is unable or neglects to carry out its clean-up obligations, the current owner of the contaminated site can be held liable for reasonable remedial measures if the owner knew, or should have known, about the contamination, or if the owner consented to the polluting activity. The Finnish Environmental Protection Act applies only to pollution that has occurred on or after January 1, 1994. For contamination that occurred before this date, liability is based on the then applicable Waste Act (Fi. Jatelaki) and Waste Management Act (Fi. Jatehuoltolaki). Additionally, the Finnish Act on Compensation for Environmental Damage (Fi. Laki ymparistovahinkojen korvaamisesta) establishes a compensatory damages regime for personal injuries, damage to property and in certain cases for financial losses sustained from pollution of water, air or soil as well as from noise, vibrations, radiation, light, heat, odor or from other similar nuisances. Furthermore, the act regulates compensation for clean-up costs as well as preventive and remediation measures. The person whose activity has caused the environmental damage, a person comparable to the person carrying out the activity causing the environmental damage, or the person to whom the activity which caused the environmental damage has been assigned, if the assignee knew or should have known, at the time of assignment, about the loss or the nuisance or the threat of the same, is liable to compensate for the damage. Furthermore, our Finnish companies are required to carry insurance to comply with the Finnish Environmental Damage
119

Insurance Act (Fi. Laki ymparistovakuutuksesta) which establishes a complementary compensation scheme if the party liable for the environmental damage is insolvent or cannot be identified.
Waste and hazardous waste. Our production facilities are subject to the Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 19, 2008 on waste (as amended, the "Waste Framework Directive"). According to the EU Council, the Waste Framework Directive is aimed at encouraging re-use and recycling of waste as well as at simplifying current legislation. The directive introduces a new approach to waste management that encourages the prevention of waste. In addition, the directive lays down a five-step hierarchy of waste management options which must be applied by the EU member states when developing their national waste policies: (i) waste prevention; (ii) re-use; (iii) recycling; (iv) recovery (including energy recovery); and (v) as a last resort, safe disposal of waste. EU member states were required to transpose the Waste Framework Directive into national law within two years from its adoption.
The Waste Framework Directive is based on the "polluter pays" principle. According to the Waste Framework Directive, the costs of waste management must be borne by the original waste producer or by the current or previous waste holders. Member states may decide that the costs of waste management are to be borne partly or wholly by the producer of the product from which the waste came and that the distributors of such product may share these costs.
Dust, sludge and scale collected from engineering steel manufacturing operations are the most significant waste categories for us. These waste materials are collected and, wherever practical, recycled to recover the alloying elements they contain. Waste from our production units is sent to appropriate treatment facilities or to landfill sites licensed to accept such materials. The Council Directive 91/689/EEC of December 12, 1991 on hazardous waste sets forth provisions for the management, recovery and disposal of hazardous waste. The directive requires that all facilities generating hazardous waste must obtain a permit and subject themselves to periodic inspections as well as provide information on the origin and destination of the waste. We believe we have implemented these practices in all material respects. This directive was repealed by and integrated to the Waste Framework Directive on December 12, 2010. In addition, the Waste Framework Directive repealed and partly replaced Council Directive 75/439/EEC of June 16, 1975 on the disposal of waste oils. The EU waste list is under revision, and at this stage it is difficult to accurately predict the impact of this revision on our operations.
All our operational sites provide for an adequate collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of waste in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, regularly by involving certified third party waste disposal companies.
Incident prevention. Directive 96/82/EC of December 9, 1996 (the "Seveso II Directive"), Directive 2003/105/EC of December 16, 2003, and Directive 2012/18/EU (jointly with the Seveso II Directive, the "Seveso Directives'') address prevention, preparedness and response to industrial and chemical accidents involving hazardous substances. Operators of plants subject to the Directives are obliged to develop and implement safety procedures and precautionary measures in order to prevent major accidents and to limit their consequences for human beings and the environment.
Hazardous substances are regularly used at or required for the operation of our sites, including diesel fuel, heating fuel oil, and lubricating and hydraulic oil, which are used and stored in certified equipment that is examined regularly. Some of the sites of the Group are subject to rules for dangerous substances in production and storage facilities and aims to prevent major accidents involving dangerous substances and limit their consequences to the human health and the environment under the Seveso II Directive. We have implemented the Seveso II Directive rules at these sites and we believe we are currently in compliance with their requirements.
Issued in 1996, it is applicable to any establishment where dangerous substances are present or likely to be produced as a result of an accident, in quantities equal to or in excess of the quantities listed in an annex to the directive. In Finland, the directive was implemented into the Chemical Act (Fi. Kemikaalilaki), the Act on Explosives (Fi. Laki rajahdysvaarallisista aineista), which was replaced in 2005 by the Act on Safe Handling of Dangerous Chemicals and Explosives (Fi. Laki vaarallisten kemikaalien ja rajahteiden kasittelyn turvallisuudesta), and the Decree on Industrial Handling and
120

Storage of Dangerous Chemicals (Fi. Asetus vaarallisten kemikaalien teollisesta ksittelyst ja varastoinnista). These regulations contain provisions relating to on-site inspections by relevant agencies and the obligation to compile and regularly update safety, rescue and evacuation plans. A review of the Seveso II Directive has been conducted, and on December 21, 2010, the Commission adopted a proposal for a new directive that would repeal and replace the current Seveso II Directive (primarily to conform the Seveso II Directive to the REACH Regulation (as defined under "REACH" below)). Based on this proposal, Directive 2012/18/EU of July 4, 2012 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances, amending and subsequently repealing Council Directive 96/82/EC (the "Seveso III Directive") was adopted, which amends and subsequently repeals the Seveso II Directive. EU member states are required to transpose the Seveso III Directive by May 31, 2015 and apply it from June 1, 2015. It is too early to predict the impact of the new directive on the operations of the Group companies. The production facilities of our Swedish and Finnish companies are covered by the Seveso II Directive (as of June 1, 2015, the Seveso III Directive) and its national implementations. In Sweden, the directive was implemented by the Act on measures for preventing and minimizing the consequences of severe chemical accidents (Sw. Lag (1999:381) om tgrder fr att frebygga och begrnsa fljderna av allvarliga kemikalieolyckor) and by amendments to the Swedish Environmental Act. In Finland, the implementation process is ongoing and it is expected that a bill shall be submitted to the Finnish Parliament by the end of 2014.
Our Swedish companies are subject to and comply with regulation by the Act on Measures for Preventing and Minimizing the Consequences of Severe Chemical Accidents (Sw. Lag (1999:381) om tgrder fr att frebygga och begrnsa fljderna av allvarliga kemikalieolyckor) which contain detailed rules on the storage, handling and use of chemical substances. Our Finnish companies are subject to and comply with regulation by the Chemical Act (Fi. Kemikaalilaki) the Act on Safe Handling of Dangerous Chemicals and Explosives (Fi. Laki vaarallisten kemikaalien ja rjhteiden ksittelyn turvallisuudesta), and the Finnish Decree on Industrial Handling and Storage of Dangerous Chemicals (Fi. Valtioneuvoston asetus vaarallisten kemikaalien ksittelyn ja varastoinnin valvonnasta) which contain detailed rules on the storage, handling and use of chemical substances. Our Swedish and Finnish companies have obtained the necessary permits regarding the storage and use of chemicals and are subject to regular inspections at our sites.
Work health and safety. The general Swedish rules on occupational safety are stipulated in the Swedish Work Environment Act (Sw. arbetsmiljlagen) and a number of governmental decrees which place the main responsibility to take precautionary health and safety measures on the employer. Under the Act, the employer is required to identify potential health and safety hazards, evaluate the potential risk to the employees and promote an occupation health and safety policy. Additionally, the act stipulates requirements for structural and functional safety at the workplace as well as the storage, maintenance and handling of chemicals.
In December 2013, there was a fatal accident at Ovako Bar AB's site Smedjebacken. The Swedish Work Environment Authority has conducted an investigation which does not indicate that the Company has violated any major regulations. Their investigation report has been handed over to the Swedish Police Authority who is conducting an independent investigation which has not yet been completed. It cannot be ruled out that the board of directors of Ovako Bar AB or the person to whom the work environmental responsibilities has been delegated (e.g. the managing director) may be subject to criminal charges. Ovako Bar AB could also be fined for the accident.
The general Finnish rules on occupational safety are contained in the Finnish Occupational Safety and Health Act (Fi: Tyturvallisuuslaki) and a number of governmental decrees which place the main responsibility to take precautionary health and safety measures on the employer. Under the law, the employer is required to identify potential health and safety hazards, evaluate the potential risk to the employees and promote an occupation health and safety policy. Additionally, the act stipulates requirements for structural and functional safety at the workplace as well as the storage, maintenance and handling of chemicals. Furthermore, pursuant to the Finnish Occupational Health Care Act (Fi: Tyterveyshuoltolaki), our Finnish companies are required to arrange for the availability of professional occupational health services for their employees at their sites.
121

The REACH Regulation. We are subject to Regulation No. 1907/2006/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of December 18, 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (as amended, the "REACH Regulation"), which came into force on June 1, 2007. The REACH Regulation created the European Chemical Agency (the "ECHA") to manage all tasks related to it and to coordinate the necessary measures as well as to ensure a consistent implementation of the regulation at the community level. According to the ECHA, the REACH Regulation requires industry to bear certain responsibilities in managing the risks posed by chemicals and to provide appropriate safety information to their users. This includes testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of basic chemicals and chemical intermediates. In parallel, the REACH Regulation allows the EU to take additional measures regarding highly dangerous substances where there is a need for complementing actions at the EU level. We registered all required high volume products (substances) prior to the deadline in 2010 and we provide the required information to customers and other stakeholders. Companies were required to register medium volume substances by May 31, 2013. We registered all required medium volume products (substances) prior to the deadline in 2013 and we provide the required information to customers and other stakeholders. Future changes in REACH requirements, such as restrictions or a ban an a highly dangerous substance, could result in additional obligations and costs.
Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 ("CLP Regulation") requires companies to appropriately classify, label and package their substances and mixtures before placing them on the market. The main goal of the Regulation is to protect workers, consumers and the environment by means of labelling which reflects possible hazardous effects of a particular chemical. CLP Regulation complements REACH Regulation in regard to notification of classifications, the establishment of a list of harmonized classifications and the creation of a classification and labelling inventory.
Sulfur emissions. Council Directive 1999/32/EC provides for the reduction in the sulfur content of certain liquid fuels used by member states. The Directive aims to reduce the emissions of sulfur resulting from the combustion of certain types of liquid fuels and thereby reducing the harmful effects of such emissions on citizens and the environment. By Directive 2012/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 21, 2012 amending Council Directive 1999/32/EC as regards the sulfur content of marine fuels, the maximum permissible sulfur content of maritime fuels used in sensitive areas such as the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel will fall from the previous level of 1.5% to 0.1% as of January 1, 2015. Other areas are to achieve a reduction from 3.5% to 0.5% by January 1, 2020. The changes are to be phased in during a five-year period between 2015 and 2020.
Insurance
We believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate for our business. We maintain general liability, property damage, business interruption and a variety of other insurance policies through third party policies. We also maintain workers' compensation and motor liability coverage that is compulsory in Sweden, Finland and the other countries in which we operate. The combined limit for our general liability policy was EUR50 million, and for our property damage and business interruption policy EUR350 million. Our insurance coverage meets all statutory and contractual insurance requirements.
We have one open claim. There was a ladle breakthrough with a resulting fire at our Imatra facility on May 16, 2013. After repairs, steel production resumed on June 25, 2013. We estimate the loss to be approximately EUR11 million of which the insurance company has paid EUR8.0 million. There are no other material claims outstanding.
122

Legal proceedings
From time to time, we are party to a variety of claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. At present, however, we expect that none of these claims or proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims, the ultimate resolution of these matters as well as future lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.

The following is a summary o f material provisions o f our principal financing arrangements in addition to the Indenture after giving effect to the Transaction. The following summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents. Certain capitalized terms used in this section refer to those terms as defined in the underlying agreements described in this section.
Revolving Credit Facility
On or prior to the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries will enter into a super senior revolving credit facility agreement expressed to be governed by English law with, Nordea Bank AB (publ) as mandated lead arranger, original lender and agent (the "RCF Agent"), providing for a committed EUR40.0 million multicurrency revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") (with an option for one or more uncommitted additional facilities of up to an aggregate amount of EUR10.0 million (the "Additional Facilities") exercisable by the Parent Company subject to certain requirements being met).

Utilisations under the Revolving Credit Facility (other than under any Additional Facilities) may be used for general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group but may not be used for (i) the payment of transaction costs related to the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of equity or certain acquisitions and disposals of assets, (ii) the purchase, redemption, repayment or prepayment of the Notes (and any refinancing of the Notes), any Pension Insurance Line, certain secured debt ranking pari passu with the Notes (any refinancing of such debt) or any other term debt, (iii) the payment of any dividend, redemption, repurchase, defeasement, retirement, repayment, premium or any other distribution in respect of share capital or (iv) refinancing any cash utilisations under any other facility available to a member of the Group. Utilizations under the Additional Facilities may be used for any purpose agreed to by the person(s) providing commitments thereunder.
Under the Revolving Credit Facility, a lender may make all or a portion of its commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility available as an ancillary facility, including overdraft facilities, guarantee, bonding, documentary or standby letter of credit facilities, short-term loan facilities, derivatives facilities and foreign exchange facilities, subject in each case to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent.
The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the date falling four years and six months after the Issue Date (or such other date as may be agreed in the case of any Additional Facility which shall be no earlier than the original termination date of the Revolving Credit Facility).
Interest will be payable on utilizations under the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount equal to the European Interbank Offered Rate (in the case of utilizations drawn in Euros), the Stockholm Interbank Offered Rate (in the case of utilizations drawn in Swedish Kroner) or the London Interbank Offered Rate (in all other cases), plus a margin. The initial margin payable on loans utilized under the Revolving Credit Facility is 3.50% per annum and will be, after twelve months from the Issue Date, a percentage rate per annum determined in accordance with a net leverage ratio related margin grid (ratchet) with a range from 3.00% to 3.50% per annum. We are also required to pay a commitment fee in arrears on the last day of each successive three-month period during the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility, on the available but unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 40% of the applicable margin under the Revolving Credit Facility. We may also be required to pay fees related to the issuance of Additional Facilities, and certain fees to the RCF Agent and the Security Agent in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility.
131

The Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by the Parent Company, the Issuer, and the other Guarantors and will be secured by the same Collateral that secures the Notes and the Guarantees. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides that, at the Issue Date and thereafter by reference to the Group audited annual financial statements, the aggregate gross assets (excluding goodwill, intragroup items and investments in subsidiaries) and EBITDA (in each case, calculated on an unconsolidated basis) of the Guarantors must (subject to certain limitations) represent not less than 85% of the Restricted Group's consolidated gross assets (excluding goodwill) and consolidated EBITDA (the "Guarantor Threshold Test").
Subject to certain conditions, we may voluntarily prepay all or part of our utilizations or permanently cancel all or part of the available commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, by giving five or three, respectively, business days' prior written notice to the RCF Agent. Amounts prepaid or repaid may (subject to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) be reborrowed.
In addition to any voluntary prepayments, the Revolving Credit Facility requires the Revolving Credit Facility to be prepaid and, in certain circumstances, cancelled, in the following circumstances (the "Mandatory Prepayment Provisions"):
(1) repayment in full of utilizations funded by, and cancellation of the commitments of, any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such lender to perform any of its obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility or to fund, issue or maintain its participation in any utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility;
(2) repayment in full of the Revolving Credit Facility and cancellation of the commitments thereunder immediately following the occurrence of a "Change of Control'' (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and which includes a Notes Change of Control);
(3) immediately following a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Restricted Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions if we choose to prepay such proceeds; and
(4) if we repay more than EUR90.0 million (plus the amount of any additional shareholder funding made available for that purpose) or 50%, of the aggregate principal amount of the notes (and any replacement debt) as at the date of the agreement we need to cancel a pro rata amount of the commitments in respect of the Pension Insurance Line and the Revolving Facility (and repay a pro rata amount of any loans outstanding under such facilities).
The Parent Company must comply with a minimum EBITDA test (whereby the Consolidated EBITDA shall not be less than EUR35.0 million), which is tested quarterly on a rolling twelve month basis provided that, if the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the ancillary facilities are not utilized or, if utilized, are fully cash collateralized, during the last 10 days of the relevant testing period, a failure to comply with the minimum EBITDA test will not result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Parent Company may cure a breach of the minimum EBITDA test by procuring the contribution of additional equity funding, in cash. 50% of the amount of such additional equity funding will be included in the Parent Company's consolidated EBITDA for purposes of testing compliance with the minimum EBITDA covenant. The equity cure may not be used more than two times during the life of the Revolving Credit Facility, and may not be used more than once in any fiscal year. We will be unable to draw new money under the Revolving Credit Facility if we were not in compliance with the minimum EBITDA requirement when it was last tested.
Our Group is subject to certain restrictive and, as the case may be, affirmative covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement customary for this type of financing, subject to certain specified exceptions and/or qualifications (customized to our business and adjusted to our current credit standing). These restrictive and affirmative covenants largely replicate those covenants which apply under the Notes subject to certain agreed amendments and exceptions, but also provide for further customary restrictive and affirmative covenants. The covenants include,
132

among other things, (i) compliance with law (including environmental laws anti-corruption laws); (ii) maintaining adequate insurance; (iii) ensuring compliance with pension liabilities; and (iv) compliance with the Guarantor Threshold Test. There are also restrictions on our ability to (i) purchase the Notes (ii) incur financial indebtedness; (iii) conduct certain activities at the Parent Company level; and (iv) pay dividends and make investments (together the "Restrictive Covenants").
Additionally, under the Revolving Credit Facility we have the obligation to provide certain financial information and other information regarding our financial condition to the lenders, such information to be provided monthly, quarterly and annually (the "Information Undertakings").
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement sets out certain events of default which are customary for such type of financing. The events of default include (i) non-payment; (ii) breach of the minimum EBITDA test; (iii) insolvency; (iv) insolvency proceedings; (iv) cross-default in relation to the Notes and the Pension Insurance Line; and (v) subject to a materiality threshold of EUR5.0 million in aggregate, a cross default in relation to certain other financial indebtedness of the Restricted Group (the "Event of Default Provisions"). The occurrence of any such event of default would, subject to any applicable grace periods, cure rights or agreed exceptions, entitle the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility to cancel their commitments, declare that all or part of the loans (together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued or outstanding in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility (including any Additional Facility)) be immediately due and payable or payable on demand.
Intercreditor Agreement
In connection with entering into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Original Pension Insurance Line Agreement and the Indenture, the Parent Company, the Issuer and certain of the Issuer's subsidiaries will enter into an intercreditor agreement (the "Intercreditor Agreement") to govern the relationships and relative priorities among: (i) the creditors of the Revolving Credit Facility (the "RCF Lenders"); (ii) the PIL Lenders; (iii) the Trustee on behalf of itself and the holders of the Notes (the "Noteholders"); (iv) the hedge counterparties under certain (present or future) hedging agreements (the "Hedge Counterparties"); (v) the creditors of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries under certain future indebtedness; (vi) the creditors and debtors under certain intra-group indebtedness; (vii) the direct or indirect shareholders of the Parent Company in respect of certain debt that the Parent Company or any of its subsidiaries has occurred or may incur in the future; (viii) the present and any future issuing bank in respect of the Pension Insurance Line; (ix) certain creditor representatives under the foregoing indebtedness; and (x) the Security Agent.
The Parent Company and each of its subsidiaries that incurs any liability or provides any guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Pension Insurance Line or the Indenture or the documentation of any Pari Passu Debt (as defined below) is referred to in this description as a "Debtor".
The Intercreditor Agreement will set out:
 the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;
 the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors;
 when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;
 when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;
 the application of proceeds on enforcement;
 the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events;
133

 turnover of proceeds provisions; and
 when security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of the Collateral.
The Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions relating to future indebtedness that may be incurred by the Debtors provided that it is permitted by the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Pension Insurance Line Agreement and the Indenture, which may rank pari passu to the Notes and be secured by the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the "Pari Passu Debt"). The creditors of the Pari Passu Debt (the "Pari Passu Creditors") will have certain rights under the Intercreditor Agreement which are summarized below.
The Intercreditor Agreement will also allow for a refinancing of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Pension Insurance Line, the Notes and any Pari Passu Debt. For the purposes of this description, any references to the Revolving Credit Facility, RCF Lenders, Credit Facility Liabilities (as defined below), Pension Insurance Line, PIL Lenders, Pension Insurance Line Liabilities (as defined below), Notes, Noteholders or Notes Liabilities (as defined below) should be read as including any such refinancing debt. With respect to any Pension Insurance Line, such refinancings may include increases in commitments and Additional Pension Insurance Lines being put into place up to the amount of our pension liability at the applicable time.
The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, that will be contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety, nor does it describe provisions relating to the rights and obligations of holders of other classes of our debt. As such, we urge you to read the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the discussion which follows, defines the rights of the Noteholders.
Ranking and priority
The Intercreditor Agreement will provide, subject to the provisions regarding permitted payments below, that all present and future liabilities and obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility (the "Credit Facility Liabilities"), the Pension Insurance Line (the "Pension Insurance Line Liabilities") the hedging agreements entered into by the Hedge Counterparties (the "Hedging Liabilities"), the Notes (the "Notes Liabilities") and the Pari Passu Debt will rank pari passu in right and priority of payment without any preference between them.
These liabilities will rank ahead of (i) any liabilities and obligations of the Debtors to the Parent Company and its subsidiaries (the "Intra-Group Liabilities"), and (ii) any shareholder debt (which consists of liabilities and obligations owed by any Debtor to any shareholder, direct or indirect, of the Parent Company) (the "Shareholder Liabilities" and, together with the Intra-Group Liabilities the "Subordinated Liabilities"). The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank the Subordinated Liabilities as between themselves.
Collateral
The RCF Lenders, the PIL Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties, the Noteholders and the Pari Passu Creditors (the "Secured Creditors") will benefit from a common security package (which will be subject to customary limitations on guarantees and security) and (subject to customary exceptions) no Creditor shall accept security unless such security is also, to the extent legally possible, at the same time granted for the benefit of the other Secured Creditors. The Collateral shall rank and secure the liabilities owed to the Credit Facility Lenders, the PIL Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties, the Noteholders and the Pari Passu Creditors pari passu and without any preference between them, except that pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, all proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral or from the Collateral following a Distress Event will be applied as provided below under "--Application o f proceeds". In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the guarantees and security will be released in certain circumstances described further below in "--Release o f security and guarantees--non-distressed disposals" and "--Release o f security and guarantees--distressed disposals".
134

Permitted payments
Prior to an acceleration event, the Intercreditor Agreement will permit payments to be made by the Debtors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (or any other documentation setting out the terms of the Credit Facility Liabilities, (together with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the "Credit Facilities Agreements"), the Pension Insurance Line Agreement, the Indenture and any Pari Passu Debt documentation (provided such payments are permitted under such documents (or any documents relating to refinancing indebtedness is complied with)) and does not limit or restrict any other payment by any Debtor other than in respect of the Subordinated Liabilities. The Intercreditor Agreement will also permit payments to lenders of Intra-Group Liabilities provided that there has been no acceleration event. No payments may be made in respect of Shareholder Liabilities except as permitted by the Credit Facility Agreements, the Pension Insurance Line Agreement, the Indenture and any Pari Passu Debt documentation. There are also restrictions on payments to Hedge Counterparties except certain specified permitted payments.
The Debtors may not make payments in respect of the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Pension Insurance Line Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities or any Pari Passu Debt after an acceleration event unless in accordance with the enforcement proceeds waterfall described below under "--Application o f proceeds" or otherwise agreed with the other Creditor.
An acceleration event includes the exercise by the relevant creditor representative of any or all of its rights under certain acceleration provisions of, or any acceleration provisions being automatically invoked under, a Credit Facility Agreement, a Pension Insurance Line Agreement, the Indenture and any Pari Passu Debt documentation.
Limitations on enforcement
The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise instructed by the Instructing Group. For the purposes of enforcement, "Instructing Group" means either more than 66 2/3% by value of a the PIL Lenders (the "Majority PIL Lenders"); (ii) more than 66 2/3% by value of a combined class of Credit Facility Lenders and Super Senior Hedge Counterparties (the "Majority Super Senior Creditors"); or (iii) a simple majority by value of a combined class of Noteholders, Pari Passu Creditors and Non-Super Senior Hedge Counterparties (the "Majority Senior Creditors"), determined in accordance with "--Conflicting enforcement instructions" below. Hedge Counterparties will vote in accordance with the mark-to-market value of their exposure (in respect of hedging which has not been closed out) or the close-out amount owing to them (in respect of hedging which has been closed out).
The Security Agent is not obliged to enforce the Collateral until it has received any indemnification and/or security that it may in its discretion require. If either the Majority PIL Lenders, the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Creditors wish to instruct the Security Agent to commence enforcement of any of the Collateral, they must give at least 5 business days' notice of the proposed enforcement instructions to the creditor representatives for the other creditor classes and the Security Agent. The giving of this notice will commence a 30 day consultation period during which time the creditor representatives for each of the creditor classes must consult with each other in good faith with a view to coordinating the proposed instructions.
In certain circumstances, a creditor representative will not be obliged to consult as described above (or will only be obliged to consult for a shorter period).
Conflicting enforcement instructions
At the end of the consultation period, the Security Agent must act on the instructions of the Instructing Group as to the enforcement of the Collateral provided that those instructions are consistent with the security enforcement principles (see further below). If there are conflicting enforcement instructions given to the Security Agent by the different classes of creditors who can constitute the Instructing Group, then, provided that the Majority Senior Creditors have complied
135

with the consultation process set out above and those instructions are consistent with the security enforcement principles, the enforcement instructions from the Majority Senior Creditors will prevail over those of the Majority PIL Lenders and the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Creditors will constitute the Instructing Group.
If the Majority Senior Creditors fail to give any enforcement instructions by the end of the consultation period, then, provided that the Majority Super Senior Creditors have complied with the consultation process set out above and those instructions are consistent with the security enforcement principles, the Majority Super Senior Creditors will constitute the Instructing Group.
If the Majority Senior Creditors and the Majority Super Senior Creditors fail to give any enforcement instructions by the end of the consultation period, and the Majority PIL Lenders are entitled to take Enforcement Action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, provided that the Majority PIL Lenders have complied with the consultation process set out above and those instructions are consistent with the security enforcement principles, the Majority PIL Lenders will constitute the Instructing Group.
If, however, (a) the Security Agent has not been instructed to take any enforcement action within three months of the date of the first enforcement instructions or (b) the Super Senior Creditors have not been repaid in full within six months of the date of the first enforcement instructions, any enforcement instructions given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will then prevail, provided that they are consistent with the security enforcement principles and notwithstanding the fact that actions pertaining to Enforcement may be on-going at such time pursuant to instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Creditors.
And if (a) the Security Agent has not been instructed to take any enforcement action within six months of the date of the first enforcement instructions or (b) the PIL Lenders have not been repaid in full within twelve months of the date of the first enforcement instructions, and the Majority PIL Lenders are entitled to take Enforcement Action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, any enforcement instructions given by the Majority PIL Lenders will then prevail, provided that they are consistent with the security enforcement principles and notwithstanding the fact that actions pertaining to Enforcement may be on-going at such time pursuant to instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Super Senior Creditors.
Any enforcement instructions given must comply with certain security enforcement principles and the security enforcement objective, including: to achieve the security enforcement objective, namely to maximize, so far as is consistent with prompt and expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the Collateral, the recovery of all of the secured parties; (i) all enforcement proceeds will be received by the Security Agent in cash, or sufficient enforcement proceeds will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that, after distribution in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Pension Insurance Line Liabilities, the Credit Facility Liabilities and the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities will be repaid in full; (ii) to the extent that the enforcement is over Collateral other than capital stock with an aggregate book value exceeding EUR5,000,0000 or is over capital stock, the Security Agent shall obtain an opinion from a Financial Advisor that the proceeds received from such enforcement are fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances, provided that if such enforcement action is conducted by way of Public Auction, or made pursuant to any process or proceeding conducted by a competent enforcement authority or court of law, no Financial Advisor opinion is required. The Financial Adviser's opinion will be conclusive evidence that the security enforcement objective has been met.
"Financial Adviser" means an internationally recognized investment bank or any one of BDO, Deloitte &Touche, Ernst &Young, Grant Thornton, KPMG or PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if it is not practicable for the Security Agent to appoint any such bank or firm on commercially reasonable terms (including for reasons of conflicts of interest) as determined by the Security Agent (acting in good faith), another third party professional firm which is regularly engaged in
136

providing valuations in respect of the relevant type of assets (in each case not being the firm appointed as the relevant Debtor's administrator or other relevant officer holder) selected by the Security Agent.
"Public Auction" means an auction or other competitive sale process of assets, by or on behalf of the Security Agent pursuant to an enforcement of Collateral (or by a member of the group in circumstances that are a distressed disposal), the process of such sale or disposal being conducted as follows:
a. prior to the sale or other disposal, the Security Agent shall consult with a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent (acting reasonably) with respect to the procedures which may reasonably be expected to be used to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable in the then prevailing market conditions (taking into account all relevant circumstances and with a view to facilitating a prompt and expeditious sale at the best price reasonably obtainable in the prevailing market conditions although there shall be no obligation to postpone any such sale in order to achieve a higher price);
b. subject to (ii) below, the Security Agent shall have implemented (to the extent permitted by applicable law) in all material respects the procedures recommended by such Financial Adviser in relation to such auction or process; and
c. the RCF Lenders, PIL Lenders, Hedge Counterparties, Noteholders, Pari Passu Creditors and creditors of Subordinated Liabilities shall have a right to participate in such auction or process, i.e. that any offer, or indication of a potential offer, that any of them makes shall be considered by the Security Agent or such Financial Adviser against the same criteria as any offer, or indication of a potential offer, by any other bidder or potential bidder.
For the purposes of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, (i) the Security Agent shall be entitled (at the cost of the group) to retain any Financial Adviser as its and/or any of the other Primary Creditors financial adviser to advise and assist in the proposed sale or disposition for such remuneration as the Security Agent in good faith determines is appropriate for the circumstances, (ii) except as required by applicable law, the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to use reasonable efforts to engage in a listing of any or all of any equity interests the subject of such auction or process, including without limitation if recommended by such Financial Adviser; (iii) the Security Agent and other Primary Creditors shall not under any circumstances be required to make representations, warranties or undertakings to any actual or proposed purchaser (other than customary representations in a security enforcement as to power to transfer the relevant equity interests or other assets pursuant to the Transaction Security Documents) or to indemnify any actual or proposed purchaser against any costs, liabilities or similar expenses or losses, and (iv) the Security Agent may (but is not required to) in all circumstances specify that no offer to purchase equity interests or other assets will be entertained unless such offer: (A) is for all (and not some only) of the equity interests or other assets being sold or otherwise disposed of, (B) is for cash consideration payable at closing (and therefore not including, for the avoidance of doubt, any element of deferred consideration) and is not subject to any financing conditions other than customary UK "certain funds" conditions, and/or (C) contemplates a closing of the sale of the equity interests or other assets in not more than three months (or such longer period as the Security Agent may specify) from the time of signing of the sale and purchase agreement in respect of such equity interests or other assets.
137

Turnover
Subject to certain exclusions, if any Credit Facility Lender, PIL Lender, Hedge Counterparty, Noteholder or Pari Passu Creditor (or any of their respective creditor representatives) receives or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of any Collateral or receives any of the proceeds of or arising from the Collateral except in accordance with "--Application o f proceeds" below, that person must:
(i) in relation to amounts not received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent to be held in trust and applied in accordance with "--Application o f Proceeds" below; and
(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Trustee shall only have an obligation to turn over or repay amounts received or recovered by it as described above (i) if it had actual knowledge that the receipt or recovery was an amount received in breach of a provision of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) to the extent that, prior to receiving that knowledge, it had not distributed the amount of that receipt to the Noteholders in accordance with the Indenture. A similar protection will apply to any trustee in respect of any Pari Passu Debt in the form of debt securities.
There is also a general turnover obligation on the creditors of the Subordinated Liabilities to turnover all amounts not received in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.
Application of proceeds
All amounts from time to time received pursuant to the provisions described under "--Turnover" above or recovered by the Security Agent in connection with the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the Collateral or otherwise paid to the Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement for application as set forth below shall be held by the Security Agent on trust and applied in the following order:
(i) first, (A) pro rata and pari passu, in payment of certain amounts owing to the Trustee and any trustee in respect of any Pari Passu Debt documentation and all costs and expenses incurred by the Security Agent and any receiver or delegate appointed by them, and then (B) pro rata and pari passu in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by each other creditor representative (other than in respect of Hedging Liabilities) and any receiver or delegate appointed by them;

(iv) fourth, pro rata and pari passu, in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Super Senior Creditors in connection with the enforcement of the Collateral or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent;
(v) fifth, pro rata and pari passu, in payment to (i) the agent of the RCF Lenders on behalf of the arrangers of the Revolving Credit Facilities and the Credit Facility Lenders and (ii) the Super Senior Hedge Counterparties, for application towards (A) the Arranger Liabilities and the Credit Facility Liabilities, and (B) the discharge of the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities;
138

(vi) sixth, pro rata and pari passu, in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Noteholders, the Pari Passu Creditors and the Non-Super Senior Hedge Counterparties in connection with the enforcement of the Collateral or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent;
(vii) seventh, pro rata and pari passu, in payment to (i) the Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders for application towards the discharge of the Notes Liabilities in accordance with the Indenture; (ii) the Pari Passu Creditors for application towards the discharge of the Pari Passu Debt; and (iii) the Non-Super Senior Hedge Counterparties for application towards the discharge of the Non-Super Senior Hedge Liabilities; and
(viii) eighth, after all the secured creditors have been repaid in full, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant Debtor or other person entitled to it.
Option to purchase
The Noteholders and Pari Passu Creditors may, after the commencement of a consultation period referred to in "--Limitations on enforcement" above, and subject to various conditions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (including the grant of an acceptable indemnity against clawback to the Credit Facility Lenders, the PIL Lenders and the Hedge Counterparties), exercise an option to purchase the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Pension Insurance Line Liabilities and the Hedging Liabilities in full and at par (in the case of Credit Facility Liabilities or the Pension Insurance Line) or the close-out amount owing to them (in the case of Hedging Liabilities).
The Super Senior Creditors may, after the commencement of a consultation period referred to in "--Limitations on enforcement" above, and subject to various conditions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (including the grant of an acceptable indemnity against clawback to the PIL Lenders), exercise an option to purchase the Pension Insurance Line Liabilities in full and at par.
Release of security and guarantees--non-distressed disposals
In circumstances where a disposal is not a distressed disposal (and is otherwise not prohibited by the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (and in certain circumstances, facilities that refinance the Revolving Credit Facility), the Pension Insurance Line Agreement, the Indenture and any Pari Passu Debt documentation), the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent is authorized:
(a) to release the Collateral or any other claim over the relevant asset; and
(b) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a member of the group, to release the Collateral or any other claim over the assets of that member of the group and the shares in and assets of any of its subsidiaries,
provided that, in the case of a disposal to another member of the group, any required replacement security is granted by the transferee before or at the same time as the release (subject to any requirements relating to the release, retaking, amendment or extension of the Collateral under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (and in certain circumstances, facilities that refinance the Revolving Credit Facility), the Pension Insurance Line Agreement, the Indenture or any Pari Passu Debt documentation).
Release of security and guarantees--distressed disposals
In circumstances where a distressed disposal is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent is authorized:
(a) to release the Collateral or any other claim over the relevant asset;
(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release (i) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing
139

liabilities, guaranteeing liabilities (including in relation to the Notes and any Pari Passu Debt) and certain other liabilities; (ii) any Collateral granted over that Debtor's assets and the assets of any of its subsidiaries; and (iii) any other claim of a Debtor or intra-group lender over that Debtor's assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor;
(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor, to release (i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, guaranteeing liabilities (including in relation to the Notes and any Pari Passu Debt) and certain other liabilities; (ii) any Collateral granted over the assets of that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company; and (iii) any other claim of a Debtor or intra-group lender over the assets of that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company;
(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding company of a Debtor, to transfer Intra-Group Liabilities and debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding company of a Debtor or any of their subsidiaries to another Debtor and/or to transfer corresponding claims in respect of any Intra-Group Liabilities and debtor liabilities.
Any net proceeds of the disposal must be applied in accordance with the enforcement proceeds waterfall described above under "--Application o f proceeds".
Amendment
The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended with the consent of more than 66 2/3% by value of each of, the Credit Facility Lenders and the PIL Lenders, the required percentage of Noteholders (as set out in the Indenture), the required percentage of Pari Passu Creditors in respect of each tranche of Pari Passu Debt (as set out in the relevant Pari Passu Debt documentation), the Parent Company and the Security Agent unless the amendment relates to certain specified matters such as ranking, priority, redistribution, turnover, enforcement, non distressed disposals, distressed disposals or the payments waterfall. Such amendments require consent from all Credit Facility Lenders and PIL Lenders, 90% by value of Noteholders, either 90% by value or all of the Pari Passu Creditors, depending on the type of debt each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent such amendments adversely affect it), the Parent Company and the Security Agent.
No amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement may impose new or additional obligations on or withdraw or reduce the rights of any party (other than in a way which affects creditors of that party's class generally) under the Intercreditor Agreement without the prior consent of that party (or, in the case of the Noteholders, the Trustee, and in the case of Pari Passu Creditors which are holders of debt securities, the relevant trustee in respect thereof). The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended without the consent of the Noteholders in certain circumstances set out further in " Description o f Notes--Certain covenants--Additional intercreditor agreements" below.
If the Debtors wish to enter into Pari Passu Debt or other additional or replacement indebtedness ("Additional Indebtedness") which is permitted to share in the Collateral pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (and in certain circumstances, facilities that refinance the Revolving Credit Facility), the Pension Insurance Line Agreement, the Indenture and any then existing Pari Passu Debt documentation, the parties to the Intercreditor Agreement may be required to enter into a replacement intercreditor agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement or to amend the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, provided that such documentation does not otherwise adversely affect the interests of the Credit Facility Lenders, the PIL Lenders the Hedge Counterparties, the Noteholders and any other Pari Passu Creditors. The Intercreditor Agreement will also permit the Security Agent to enter into new or supplemental security and/or release and retake Collateral if certain conditions are met, set out further in "Description o f Notes--Certain covenants--Impairment o f security interest" below.
140

Subject to certain exclusions, in the event that the requisite percentage of Credit Facility Lenders agree to any amendments or consents under the finance documents, the PIL Lenders will (or will be deemed to) give a corresponding consent.
Parallel Debt Provisions
The Intercreditor Agreement will contain customary provisions setting out the basis of appointment, discretions and related provisions regarding the Security Agent as well as a parallel debt, which will also be secured by the transaction security.
Intra-group receivable arrangements
Intra-group receivables
In order to provide for adequate financing within the Group, a number of intra-group receivables agreements have been entered into by and among some of the Group entities under which both upstream and cross stream loans are provided by different group companies to other members of the Group. The intra-group receivables held by the Parent Company, the Issuer, Ovako Sweden AB and Ovako Bright Bar AB will on the Issue Date be part of the Collateral.
Proceeds Loans
On the Issue Date, the Issuer, as lender, will make certain of the net proceeds of the Offering of the Notes available to each of Ovako Sweden AB, Ovako Bright Bar AB, Ovako Bar AB and Ovako Imatra Oy Ab, as respective borrowers, in order to enable such subsidiaries to repay outstanding amounts under the Senior Credit Facilities (the "Proceeds Loans"). The Proceeds Loans will be governed by Swedish law. Security will be granted over the Proceeds Loans and the Proceeds Loans will be part of the Collateral. See "R isks rela tin g to an in vestm en t in th e N otes a n d the

Other indebtedness to be repaid in connection with the transaction
Senior facility
In connection with the Ovako Group restructuring in 2010, a EUR385.0 million and SEK440.0 million senior facilities agreement dated August 10, 2010 was concluded between the Parent Company, certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries and Nordea Bank AB (publ) as the mandated lead arranger, original lender, agent and the security agent (the "Senior Facilities Agreement"). As of March 31, 2014, borrowings under the senior facilities amounted to EUR273.0 million. The facilities subject to the senior facilities agreement are a multicurrency revolving facility, euro term facility A, a euro term facility B and a guarantee facility.
Release of existing security
In connection with the Ovako Group restructuring in 2010, we granted guarantees and security interests over certain shares in the companies in the Ovako Group (including some of the Guarantors), real estate, floating charges, intra group loans, bank accounts and intellectual property rights, to secure the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement.
We expect to use a portion of the proceeds of this offering to repay all amounts outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement and to pay related transaction costs. Upon payment of such amounts, we expect all such security interests to be fully and unconditionally discharged and released.

Description of Notes
Ovako AB (pub!) (the "Issuer") will issue Euro-denominated notes (the "Notes") under an indenture (the "Indenture") among, inter alios, itself, as issuer, Ovako Group AB (the "Parent"), the Issuer's subsidiaries that guarantee the Notes (the "Subsidiary Guarantors" and, together with the Parent, the "Guarantors"), U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as security agent (the "Security Agent"), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this " Description o f Notes" to the Notes include any Additional Notes that are issued. See " Notice to investors". The terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture will not incorporate or include any of, or be subject to, the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The Security Documents referred to below under the caption "--Security" describe the terms of the security that will secure the Notes.
The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Security Documents and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Note, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth below under "--Additional information".
You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading "--Certain definitions". Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under "--Certain definitions" have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. In this description, the term "Issuer" refers only to Ovako AB (publ) and not to any of its Subsidiaries; the term "Parent" refers only to Ovako Group AB and not to any of its Subsidiaries; and the terms "we", "our" and "us" refer to the Parent and, where the context so requires, certain or all of its Subsidiaries.
The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under the Indenture.
Brief description of the notes and the note guarantees
The Notes
The Notes:
 will be general senior obligations of the Issuer;
 will be secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral, but will receive proceeds from enforcement of security over the Collateral or otherwise from the Collateral, only after any obligations secured on a super priority basis have been paid in full. Such obligations include obligations under the Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;
 will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by Liens senior to the Liens securing the Notes, or secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of property and assets securing such Indebtedness;
 will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including Indebtedness incurred under the Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;
 will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; and
 will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantors.
142

The Note Guarantees
The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent and the Subsidiary Guarantors (subject to the guarantee limitations contained in the Indenture). The initial Subsidiary Guarantors will be each of Ovako Sweden AB, Ovako Bright Bar AB, Ovako Forsbacka AB, Ovako Bar AB, Triako Finco AB, Ovako GmbH (Germany), Ovako Finland Oy Ab (Finland) and Ovako Imatra Oy Ab (Finland). The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor:
 will be a general obligation of that Guarantor;
 will be secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral, but will receive proceeds from enforcement of security over the Collateral or otherwise from the Collateral, only after any obligations secured on a super priority basis. Such obligations include obligations under the Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;
 will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by Liens senior to the Liens securing such Note Guarantee or secured by property or assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;
 will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee, including Indebtedness incurred under the Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;
 will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; and
 will be effectively senior to all of such Guarantor's existing and future unsecured Indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing such Note Guarantee.
Certain of the Note Guarantees will be limited in value and subject to certain contractual or other limitations or subordinated under German or other applicable law. These limitations are generally related to local corporate or other law. See " Risk factors--Risks relating to an investment in the Notes and the Guarantees--The Guarantees and security interests on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability".
Not all of the Parent's and the Issuer's Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or a Guarantor. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, Subsidiary Guarantors collectively represented 88.9% of our net sales and 103.9% of our consolidated EBITDA and as of December 31, 2013, they represented 89.6% of our total assets. These figures represent revenue, EBITDA and total assets, as applicable, after intercompany eliminations. Certain of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries have negative EBITDA and total assets.
The operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries and therefore the Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of any of the Issuer's non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-Guarantor Subsidiary's creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-Guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-Guarantor Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the non-Guarantor
143

Subsidiary senior to that held by the Issuer or such Guarantor. As of March 31, 2014, after giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing, on a consolidated basis, the Parent's subsidiaries that will not Guarantee the Notes would not have had any Indebtedness outstanding. See " Risk factors-- Risks related to our structure and indebtedness--Other than providing management services, the Issuer is a holding company and depends on distributions from its subsidiaries to service and repay the Notes; certain covenants in our financing arrangements and other agreements may limit the availability o f operating cash flow to the Issuer".
As of the Issue Date, all of the Parent's Subsidiaries will be "Restricted Subsidiaries" for purposes of the Indenture. Under certain circumstances described below under the caption "--Certain Covenants--Designation o f Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries", the Parent will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as "Unrestricted Subsidiaries". Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.
Principal, maturity and interest
The Issuer will issue EUR300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes in this offering. The Issuer may issue additional Notes ("Additional Notes") under the Indenture from time to time after this offering. The Notes may be issued in one or more series under the Indenture. Any issuance of Additional Notes will be subject to all of the covenants in the Indenture, including the covenant described below under the caption "--Certain covenants--Incurrence o f Indebtedness and issuance o f preferred stock". The Notes and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture ; provided, however, that in the event any Additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes issued in this offering for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such nonfungible Additional Notes will be issued with a separate CUSIP, ISIN or other identifying number so that they are distinguishable from the Notes. The Issuer will issue Notes in minimum denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2019. The redemption price at maturity will equal 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed.
Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate per annum equal to 6.500%. Interest on the Notes will:
 accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;
 be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1, commencing on December 1, 2014;
 be payable to the holder of record of such Notes on May 15 and November 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and
 be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.
Interest on overdue principal and interest, if any, will accrue at a rate 1.0% higher than the then applicable interest rate on the Notes.
The rights of holders of the Notes to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Note is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.
Paying agent and registrar for the notes
The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a "Paying Agent") for the Notes in the City of London for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
144

Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market. The Issuer will undertake to maintain a Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union Directive 2003/48/EC (as amended from time to time) or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting on November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such directive. The initial Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services Limited, U.K. Branch, acting through its London office.
The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a "Registrar") for the Notes. The Issuer will also maintain one or more transfer agents. The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services Limited and the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial Services Limited, U.K. Branch.
The Registrar will maintain a register (the "Register") outside the United Kingdom reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer and a copy of the Register will be sent to the Issuer on the Issue Date and after any change to the Register made by the Registrar, with such copy to be held by the Issuer at its registered office. In case of discrepancies between the Register and the register held by the Issuer at its registered office, the latter will prevail for purposes of Luxembourg law. See "Book-entry, delivery and form".
The Issuer may change the Paying Agents, the Registrar or the transfer agents without prior notice to the holders of Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a daily newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is currently expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).
Methods of receiving payments on the Notes
Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held by the common depositary (or its nominee, as applicable) for Euroclear or Clearstream will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the holder or holders thereof.
Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities ("D e fin itiv e R e g iste re d N o te s") may be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents in the City of London maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by wire transfer or by check mailed to the person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See "--Paying Agent and registrar for the notes".
Transfer and exchange
Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "Rule 144A Global Notes"), and Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "Regulation S Global Notes" and together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the "Global Notes"). The Regulation S Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.
Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the "Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream Banking or Persons that may hold interests
145

through such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under "Plan o f Distribution--Transfer restrictions". In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream Banking will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream Banking pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream Banking and their respective participants.
Book-Entry Interests in the Rule 144A Global Note, or the "Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests", may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note, or the "Regulation S Book-Entry Interests", only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.
Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Book-Entry Interests in Regulation S Global Notes will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under " Notice to investors" and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.
In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.
Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under " Plan o f distribution--Transfer restrictions".
Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, where appropriate, furnish certain
146

certificates and opinions and pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange; p ro v id e d that if the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party to the transfer or exchange, the holder will not be required to pay such Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive Registered Notes:
(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;
(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;
(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or
(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.
The Issuer, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and the Paying Agent will be entitled to treat the registered holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.
Additional amounts
All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors with respect to any Note Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is then incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision thereof or therein or (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent) or any political subdivision thereof or therein (each, a "Tax Jurisdiction") will at any time be required to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors with respect to any Note Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the "Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; p ro v id e d , h o w e ver, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:
(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence of a present or former connection between the holder or the beneficial owner of the Notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, the relevant holder, if the relevant holder is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including being or having been a citizen, resident, or national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein) other than any connection arising from the holding of such Note, the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Note Guarantee or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note or a Note Guarantee;
(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to
147

the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);
(3) any estate, inheritance, gift or similar Taxes;
(4) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to an individual and that are required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting on November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with or introduced, in order to conform to, such directive, or if otherwise required by any law in respect of a payment to an individual or estate of a deceased individual;
(5) Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner of Notes who would have been able to be exempted from such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;
(6) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of Notes, following the Issuer's written request addressed to such holder or beneficial owner (and made at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request, and in all events, at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable to the holder or beneficial owner), to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirement, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation; and provided further that such obligation to provide certification or documentation is not the consequence of the failure of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors to make any previous registration, notice or filing with any competent authority;
(7) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes would not be imposed or withheld but for the application of section 1471 through 1474 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, including any current or future Treasury regulations, other official interpretations thereunder, or any law implementing an intergovernmental approach thereto ("FATCA");
(8) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer or Guarantor to the holder if such holder is a fiduciary or any person other than the beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had such holder been the beneficial owner of such Note; or
(9) any combination of items (1) through (8) above.
In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, and any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, transfer, issuance, or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Note Guarantee or any other document referred to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes after this offering) or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited, solely in the case of taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (5) or (7) above or any combination thereof), and any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee.
If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note
148

Guarantee, each of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer's Certificate must also set forth any other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Issuer and the relevant Guarantor will provide the Trustee with documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee evidencing the payment of Additional Amounts. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and will timely remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee (or to a holder upon written request), within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee or the holder) by such entity.
Whenever in the Indenture or in this " Description o f Notes" there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment under or with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.
Note Guarantees
The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. These Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Note Guarantees to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such limitations, see " Risk factors--Risks relating to an investment in the Notes and the Guarantees--The Guarantees and security interests on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability".
Note guarantees release
The Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor (and of the Parent in the case of clauses (4), (5), (6) and (7)) will be released:
(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Subsidiary Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction)
149

the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by or does not otherwise violate the "Asset Sale" provisions of the Indenture;
(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by or does not otherwise violate the "Asset Sale" provisions of the Indenture and the Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other disposition;
(3) if the Parent designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;
(4) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided below under the captions "--Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance" and "--Satisfaction and discharge";
(5) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes;
(6) in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or as otherwise provided for under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
(7) as described under "--Amendment, supplement and waiver"; or
(8) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to guarantee the Notes pursuant to the covenant described under "--Certain covenants--Limitation on issuances o f Guarantees o f Indebtedness" upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee of Indebtedness by such Restricted Subsidiary which resulted in the obligation to Guarantee the Notes; provided that such Restricted Subsidiary does not Guarantee any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor (unless such other Guarantee is released at the same time).
Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee as specified above, the Trustee will execute any documents reasonably required by the relevant Guarantor in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Guarantee. None of the Issuer, any Guarantor or the Trustee will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.
Security
General
The Notes and the Note Guarantees of the Guarantors will be secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral. Subject to the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, certain other Indebtedness and liabilities will be permitted to be secured by the Collateral now and in the future. The Collateral will be pledged, assigned or transferred pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the obligations that are secured by the Collateral, including holders of the Notes. The Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the security providers and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such limitations, please see " Risk factors--Risks relating to an investment in the Notes and the Guarantees--The Guarantees and security interests on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability".
The Collateral will initially include the following properties and assets:
 all shares of Capital Stock of the Issuer held by the Parent;
 all shares of the Capital Stock of each Subsidiary Guarantor held, directly or indirectly, by the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries;
150

 all shares of the Capital Stock of (i) Aktiebolaget Hillboms Byggnads- och Transportfirma, (ii) Ovako Cromax AB and (iii) Fastighets AB Synaren;
 certain existing Finnish bank accounts of Ovako Imatra Oy Ab;
 certain existing intercompany receivables of the Issuer, including, but not limited to, the Proceeds Loans, the Parent, Ovako Bright Bar AB and Ovako Sweden AB;
 certain Swedish business mortgages over certain movable property in accordance with law and to the extent that the property is related to the business and located in Sweden, and receivables (not including cash, bank accounts, shares and other financial instruments intended for general trading, property which can be the subject of a pledge due to a specific charge or property which can neither be subject to a levy of execution nor included in a bankruptcy or insolvent liquidation) of (i) Ovako Sweden AB of up to SEK200 million and EUR60 million, (ii) Ovako Forsbacka AB of up to SEK35 million, (iii) Ovako Bar AB of up to SEK200 million and EUR40 million;
 pledge over accounts of Ovako GmbH;
 assignment of trade receivables, intercompany receivables and insurance claims of Ovako GmbH;
 security transfer of moveable assets (including trade on stock) of Ovako GmbH;
 floating charges over certain business assets of Ovako Finland Oy Ab and over certain business assets of Ovako Imatra Oy Ab;
 certain intellectual property rights owned by Ovako Sweden AB, Ovako Bar AB and Ovako Imatra Oy Ab;
 certain real property in Sweden and Finland; and
 certain Swedish insurance receivables.
Under the Indenture, the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to maintain Permitted Collateral Liens, and will be permitted to incur certain additional Indebtedness and other liabilities in the future which may share in the Collateral, including additional Permitted Collateral Liens, securing Indebtedness and other liabilities on an equal and ratable pari passu basis with the Notes, subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, including as set forth in the following paragraph, including Indebtedness and other liabilities under the Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations, any Additional Notes and Senior Secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption "--Certain covenants--Incurrence o f Indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock". The amount of such Permitted Collateral Liens will be limited by the covenants described under the captions "--Certain covenants--Liens" and "--Certain covenants-- Incurrence o f Indebtedness and issuance o f preferred stock". Under certain circumstances, the amount of such additional Indebtedness and other liabilities secured by Permitted Collateral Liens could be significant.
The obligations under the Notes, the Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations, any Additional Notes and Senior Secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption "--Certain covenants-- Incurrence o f Indebtedness and issuance o f preferred stock" will be secured equally and ratably by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral. Any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility, Hedging Obligations under agreements or arrangements designed to manage interest rate risk with respect to any Senior Secured Indebtedness and hedging of foreign exchange risk in respect of the Pension Insurance Line, in an amount not to exceed 10.0 million, certain other Hedging Obligations will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral or otherwise from the Collateral. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will, after all obligations under the Pension Insurance Line, Revolving Credit
151

Facility and certain priority Hedging Obligations have been paid from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of all obligations under the Indenture and the Notes (including any Additional Notes), any other Hedging Obligations and any other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and secured by the Collateral on an equal and ratable pari passu basis with the Notes.
The Security Documents will be entered into by, inter alios, the Security Agent or its nominee(s), who will act as Security Agent for the lenders under the Pension Insurance Line Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, for the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and for the counterparties to the Hedging Obligations referred to above.
The proceeds from the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Notes. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Notes will be required to share recovery proceeds with other secured creditors, have certain limitations on their ability to enforce the Security Documents and have agreed that the Collateral may be released in certain circumstances without their consent. See " Risk factors--Risks relating to an investment in the Notes and the Guarantees--The value o f the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes, and there may be limitations on your ability to foreclose on the Collateral".
Each holder of the Notes, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed (i) to have authorized the Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Agent to enter into the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) to be bound thereby. Each holder of Notes, by accepting a Note, appoints the Trustee or the Security Agent, as the case may be, as its trustee or agent under the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and authorizes it to act as such.
Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Indenture, the Pension Insurance Line Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Parent and its Subsidiaries will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, to freely operate the property and assets constituting Collateral, to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing) in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral.
Security documents
The relevant security provider and the Security Agent will, as applicable, enter into Security Documents defining the terms of the Liens that secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees and the other secured obligations that will be secured by the Collateral. Subject to the terms of, and limitations under, the Security Documents, these security interests will secure the payment and performance when due of all of the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and the Security Documents. The terms of the Security Documents will limit the enforcement generally to an effect similar to the limitations on the Note Guarantees. See " Risk factors--Risks relating to an investment in the Notes and the Guarantees--The Guarantees and security interests on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability" and "Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on validity and enforceability o f the guarantees and security interests".
Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents will, as described under the caption " Description o f other indebtedness-- Intercreditor agreement", permit the Trustee and the respective agents for the Pension Insurance
152

Line and the Revolving Credit Facility to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action under the Security Documents following the occurrence of certain acceleration events under the Indenture, the Pension Insurance Line, or as applicable, the Revolving Credit Facility.
In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the obligations of the Issuer and the relevant Guarantor under the Notes, the Indenture and the relevant Note Guarantee cannot be directly secured by certain of the Security Documents. These will instead secure a parallel debt claim mirroring the obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and such Note Guarantee that is acknowledged by the relevant Guarantor by way of an independent acknowledgement of indebtedness in favor of the Security Agent in the Intercreditor Agreement. Such parallel debt claim is (subject to limitations generally to an effect similar to the limitations on the Note Guarantees) at any time equal to the total amounts and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and such Guarantor under the Notes, the Indenture and such Note Guarantee and any payment in respect of the so mirrored obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt claim and any payment in respect of the parallel debt claim will discharge the corresponding mirrored obligations. The parallel debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. Please see "Risk Factors--Risks relating to an investment in the Notes and the Guarantees--The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders o f the Notes, and the holders o f the Notes will have limited rights to enforce remedies under the Security Documents".
Neither holders of the Notes nor the Trustee are a party to the Security Documents. Therefore, neither the Trustee nor the holders of the Notes may, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The holders of the Notes may only take action through the Security Agent. The Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the holders or the Trustee. In certain circumstances, the Trustee will have the ability to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action under the Security Documents.
Release
The Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to the release of the Liens over property and other assets constituting Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees under any one or more of the following circumstances:
(1) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property or assets to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition is not prohibited by, or does not otherwise violate the "Asset Sale" provisions of the Indenture;
(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;
(3) if the Parent designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets of such Restricted Subsidiary;
(4) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes;
(5) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided below under the captions "--Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance" and "--Satisfaction and discharge";
(6) in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or as otherwise provided for under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or
153

(7) as described under "--Amendment, supplement and waiver" and "--Certain covenants--Impairment o f security interest".
The Security Agent and the Trustee will (but only to the extent actually required) take all necessary action reasonably required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be affected by the Security Agent without the consent of the holder or any action on the part of the Trustee. The release of any security interest created by a Security Document governed by Swedish or Finnish law granted by a Swedish Guarantor will always be subject to the prior written consent of the Security Agent, such consent to be granted by the Security Agent.
The requirements of the foregoing sentence shall not apply in relation to any release of any unperfected Swedish Law security interest; provided that no Event of Default is continuing at the time of such release or would result from the same.
Intercreditor agreement
On the Issue Date, the Trustee will enter into an Intercreditor Agreement with, among others, the agent under the Pension Insurance Line, the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations, as described under " Description o f other indebtedness--Intercreditor agreement". Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Pension Insurance Line, will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral or otherwise from the Collateral,followed by obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and Hedging Obligations under agreements or arrangements designed to manage interest rate risk with respect to any Senior Secured Indebtedness and foreign exchange risk with respect to any Pension Insurance Line as well as, up to an amount of 10.0 million, certain other Hedging Obligations. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will, after all obligations under the Pension Insurance Line, Revolving Credit Facility and such priority Hedging Obligations have been paid from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of all obligations under the Indenture and the Notes, any other Hedging Obligations or other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and secured by the Collateral on an equal and ratable pari passu basis with the Notes.
Optional redemption
At any time prior to June 1, 2016, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of the date of redemption, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.
Prior to June 1, 2016, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem, with all or a portion of the net proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional Notes) upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to 106.500% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to the redemption date, subject to the rights of the holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date; provided that at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the Indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and provided, further, that such redemption shall occur within 180 days of the date of the closing of any such Equity Offering.
Prior to June 1, 2016, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem during each twelve month period commencing with the Issue Date up to 10% of the principal amount of the
154

Notes (including Additional Notes) upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to the redemption date, subject to the rights of the holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Except pursuant to the preceding paragraphs and except pursuant to " -- R ed em p tio n fo r changes in ta xes", the Notes will not be redeemable at the Issuer's option prior to June 1, 2016.

On or after June 1, 2016, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on June 1 of the years indicated below, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date:

Year
2016 ........................................................................................................................... 2017 ........................................................................................................................... 2018 and thereafter.................................................................................................

Redemption Price
103.250% 101.625% 100.000%

The Issuer shall give the Trustee notice of any contemplated redemption at least five Business Days prior to the notice being given to the Holders.
Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.
Any redemption and notice may, in the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent.

Redemption for changes in taxes
The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at anytime upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in " -- Selection and n o tic e "), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a "Tax Redemption Date") and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on or before the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes, the Issuer is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts or a Guarantor would be unable for reasons outside their control to procure payment by the Issuer (or another Guarantor that would be able to make the relevant payment without paying Additional Amounts) and, in making payment itself, the relevant Guarantor would be required to pay Additional Amounts, and the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available, and the requirement arises as a result of:
(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws, treaties or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly announced before and which becomes effective on or after the date of this offering memorandum (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of this offering memorandum, such later date); or
(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or application of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which

155

amendment or change has not been publicly announced before and which becomes effective on or after the date of this offering memorandum (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of this offering memorandum, such later date) (each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), a "Change in Tax Law").
The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or the Guarantor, as applicable, would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that there has been such Change in Tax Law which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it.
The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.
The Issuer shall give the Trustee notice of any contemplated redemption at least five Business Days prior to the notice being given to the Holders.
Mandatory redemption
The Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
Repurchase at the option of holders
Change of control
If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to 100,000 or an integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder's Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"), subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice to each holder of the Notes at such holder's registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under " -- Selectio n a n d n o tic e ", stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Notes on the date (the "Change of Control Payment Date") specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with any applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:
(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
156

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the Issuer.
The Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.
The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.
The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption "--Optional redemption", unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.
The Issuer's ability to repurchase the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would constitute a mandatory prepayment event and/or a default due to a breach of undertaking under the Pension Insurance Line and the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Pension Insurance Line and the Revolving Credit Facility may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. The future Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the ability of the Issuer to pay cash to the holders of the Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by its then existing financial resources, and sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. We expect that we would require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Please see "Risk factors--Risks relating to an investment in the Notes and the Guarantees--We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence o f certain events constituting a change o f control as required by the Indenture".
The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of "all or substantially all" of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all", there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to
157

repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.
The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control.
If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any Change of Control Offer in a leading daily newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Lu xem b u rg er W ort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (w w w .b o u rse .lu ).
Asset sales
The Parent will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:
(1) the Parent (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and
(2) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:
(a) any liabilities, as recorded on the balance sheet of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee), that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and as a result of which the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with respect to such liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities;
(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Parent or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 90 days following the closing of the Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;
(c) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (1)(b) or (1)(e) of the next paragraph of this covenant;
(d) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sales having an aggregate Fair Market Value, when taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (d) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of 15.0 million and 2.0% of Tangible Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value);
(e) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Parent and each Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale; and
(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from Persons who are not the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary.
158

Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Parent (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may:
(1) apply such Net Proceeds (at the option of the Parent or Restricted Subsidiary):
(a) to repurchase, prepay or redeem (i) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral and that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, (ii) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, or (iii) any Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on assets or property which do not constitute Collateral; provided that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and, if the Indebtedness being repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, will cause the related commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, repurchased or redeemed (other than in the case of Credit Facilities Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under the caption "--Certain covenants--Incurrence o f Indebtedness and issuance o f preferred stock");
(b) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;
(c) to make a capital expenditure;
(d) to purchase the Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (a "Notes Offer");
(e) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) not classified as current assets under IFRS that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; or
(f) any combination of the foregoing; or
(2) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Proceeds pursuant to clauses (b), (c) or (e) of paragraph (1) above; provided that such binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such acquisition or expenditure is consummated, and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365-day period.
Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Parent (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.
Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant will constitute "Excess Proceeds". Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, when the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds 20.0 million, within ten Business Days thereof, the Issuer will make an offer (an "Asset Sale Offer") to all holders of Notes and may make an offer to all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes or any Note Guarantees to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price for the Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof and the offer price for such pari passu Indebtedness will be no greater than 100% of the principal amount thereof, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption (and subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), and will be
159

payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into (or to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds or if the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered pursuant to a Notes Offer exceeds the amount of the Net Proceeds so applied, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness, if applicable, to be purchased on a pro rata basis or in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream (or in the manner described under "--Selection and notice"), based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in Euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into Euro equivalent determined as of the Business Day immediately prior to the date on which the Asset Sale Offer is announced. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.
The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Notes Offer or an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control or Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control or Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
Selection and notice
Notices of redemption may be made subject to conditions precedent.
If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under " Book-entry, delivery and form", based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection, including by use of a pool factor), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not be liable for selections made by the Paying Agent in accordance with this paragraph.
No Notes of 100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Subject to the final paragraph in this " Selection and Notice", notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.
For Notes which are represented by Global Notes held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream Banking for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Notes shall also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is currently expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.

Certain covenants
Incurrence of Indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock
The Parent will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the Parent will not and will not permit the Issuer or any other Guarantor to issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares of preferred stock; p ro vid e d , h o w e ver, that
(1) the Parent may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock, and the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue preferred stock, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or such preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, in each case, determined on a p ro form a basis (including a p ro form a application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or the preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four quarter period, and
(2) if such Indebtedness to be incurred is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur such Senior Secured Indebtedness if the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio for the Parent's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred is less than 3.5 to 1.0 determined on a p ro form a basis (including a p ro form a application of the net proceeds therefrom) as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or the preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period.
The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, "Permitted Debt"):
(1) the incurrence by the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness under Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) not to exceed 40.0 million, p lu s in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing;
(2) Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness described in clauses (1), (3), (6) and (7) of this definition of Permitted Debt) of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue Date after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions;
(3) the incurrence by the Issuer and the Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by the Notes and the related Note Guarantees to be issued on the Issue Date and any related "parallel debt" obligations created in favor of the Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;
(4) the incurrence by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness represented by Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase money obligations, in each case, incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of design, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal), plant or equipment (whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets) used in the business of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, in an aggregate principal amount, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (4), not to exceed EUR15.0 million at any time outstanding;
161

(5) the incurrence by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was permitted by the Indenture to be incurred under the first paragraph of this covenant or clauses (2), (3), (5) or (13) of this paragraph;
(6) the incurrence by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Parent and any such Restricted Subsidiary; p ro v id e d that:
(a) if the Issuer or any Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the payee is not the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be unsecured and expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations then due with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the Note Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor; and
(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (6);
(7) the issuance by any Restricted Subsidiary to the Parent or to any Restricted Subsidiary of preferred stock; p ro v id e d that:
(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such preferred stock being held by a Person other than the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary; and
(b) any sale or other transfer of any such preferred stock to a Person that is not either the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an issuance of such preferred stock by such Restricted Subsidiary that was not permitted by this clause (7);
(8) the incurrence by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Hedging Obligations in the ordinary course of business and not for speculative purposes;
(9) the Guarantee by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to the extent that the guaranteed Indebtedness was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this covenant; p ro v id e d that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to or p a ri passu with the Notes or a Note Guarantee, then the Guarantee must be subordinated or p a ri passu, as applicable, to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed;
(10) the incurrence by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness in respect of (i) workers' compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, bankers' acceptances, customs, environmental, performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax and other tax guarantees or other guarantees or other similar bonds, instruments or obligations and completion guarantees and warranties, in each case incurred in the ordinary course of business and not in connection with the borrowing of money and (ii) any customary cash management, cash pooling or netting or setting-off arrangements incurred in the ordinary course of business;
(11) the incurrence by the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary providing for customary indemnification, obligations in respect of earnouts or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar obligations, in each case, incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business or assets or Person or any Equity Interests of a Subsidiary, p ro v id e d that the maximum liability of the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the Fair Market
162

Value of non-cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition;
(12) Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in respect of Management Advances;
(13) Indebtedness of any Person outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness incurred to provide all or any portion of the funds used to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary); provided, however, with respect to this clause (13), that at the time of the acquisition or other transaction pursuant to which such Indebtedness was deemed to be incurred (x) the Parent would have been able to incur 1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13) or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Parent would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13);
(14) Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with any Qualified Receivables Transaction;
(15) the incurrence by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at anytime outstanding, not to exceed 25.0 million; and
(16) the incurrence by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently drawn against insufficient funds, so long as such Indebtedness is covered within thirty Business Days.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors may not incur Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or preferred stock pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or under clauses (8) or (15) of the definition of Permitted Debt if, after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or issuance (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), the aggregate amount of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and preferred stock will exceed at any time, exceed EUR10.0 million.
For purposes of determining compliance with this " Incurrence o f Indebtedness and issuance o f preferred stock" covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (16) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant; provided, however, that Indebtedness incurred under clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt may not be reclassified, unless upon such reclassification it no longer has priority with respect to distributions of proceeds of any enforcement of Collateral.
The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; provided, in each such case, that the amount of any such accrual, accretion or payment is included in Fixed Charges of the Parent as accrued.
163

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness incurred under a revolving credit facility; p ro vid ed , h o w ever, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated in non-Euro currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement with respect to Euro the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in Euro will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the Euro-equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the Euro-equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness incurred under a revolving credit facility, except that to the extent that:
(1) such Euro-equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in which case the Refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence; and
(2) the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the Euro-equivalent of such excess will be determined on the date such refinancing Indebtedness is being incurred.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.
The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:
(1) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS;
(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and
(3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of:
(a) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and
(b) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.
Restricted payments
The Parent will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly:
(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the Parent's or any Restricted Subsidiary's Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary) or to the direct or indirect holders of the Parent's or any Restricted Subsidiary's Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Parent and other than dividends or distributions payable to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary);
(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Parent) any Equity Interests of the Parent or any Parent Entity;
(3) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or to any Note Guarantee
164

(excluding any intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Parent and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or among Restricted Subsidiaries of the Parent), except (i) a payment of interest or principal at the Stated Maturity thereof or (ii) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition or retirement of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is contractually subordinated to the Notes or to any Note Guarantee purchased in anticipation of satisfying a scheduled sinking fund obligation, principal installment or scheduled maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of such purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement;
(4) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Debt; or
(5) make any Restricted Investment
(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through (5) above being collectively referred to as "Restricted Payments"), unless, at the time of any such Restricted Payment:
(a) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such Restricted Payment;
(b) the Parent would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving p ro form a effect thereto as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, have been permitted to incur at least 1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption " -- Incurrence o f In d eb ted n ess a n d issuance o f p re fe r re d sto c k "; and
(c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue Date (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (2), (3), (5), (6), (7), (8), (10), (13) and (15) of the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum, without duplication, of:
(i) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Parent for the period (taken as one accounting period) from the fiscal quarter commencing immediately prior to the Issue Date to the end of the Parent's most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit); plus
(ii) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the Fair Market Value of marketable securities received by the Parent since the Issue Date as a contribution to its common equity capital or from the issue or sale of Equity Interests of the Parent (other than Disqualified Stock and Excluded Contributions) or from the issue or sale of convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock of the Parent or convertible or exchangeable debt securities of the Parent, in each case that have been converted into or exchanged for Equity Interests of the Parent (other than Equity Interests and convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock or debt securities) sold to a Subsidiary of the Parent) or from the issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Debt (other than an issuance or sale to a Restricted Subsidiary); plus
(iii) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the Issue Date is (a) sold, disposed of or otherwise cancelled, liquidated or repaid, 100% of the aggregate amount received in cash and the Fair Market Value of the property and marketable securities received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than from a Person that is the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary), or (b) made in an entity that subsequently becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Investment of the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries as of the date such entity becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; plus
165

(iv) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary designated as such after the Issue Date is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged or consolidated into the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, or all of the assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary are transferred to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, the Fair Market Value of the property received by the Parent or Restricted Subsidiary or the Parent's Restricted Investment in such Subsidiary as of the date of such redesignation, merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, to the extent such Investments reduced the Restricted Payments capacity under this clause (c) and were not previously repaid or otherwise reduced; plus
(v) upon the full and unconditional release of a Restricted Investment that is a Guarantee made by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary to any Person after the Issue Date, an amount equal to the amount of such Guarantee; plus
(vi) 100% of any cash dividends or distributions received by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent that such dividends or distributions were not otherwise included in the Consolidated Net Income of the Parent for such period.
The preceding provisions will not prohibit:
(1) the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any redemption within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend or giving of the redemption notice, as the case may be, if at the date of declaration or notice, the dividend or redemption payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture;

(3) the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is contractually subordinated to the Notes or to any Note Guarantee with the net cash proceeds from an incurrence of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness;
(4) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Equity Interests of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary held by any current or former officer, director or employee of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any equity subscription agreement, stock option agreement, restricted stock grant, shareholders' agreement, employment agreements, or similar agreement; p ro v id e d that the aggregate price paid for all such repurchased, redeemed, acquired or retired Equity Interests may not exceed 2.0 million in any calendar year; and p ro vid e d , fu rth er, that such amount in any calendar year may be increased by an amount not to exceed the cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary received by the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary during such calendar year, in each case to members of management or directors of the Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or any of its direct or indirect parent companies to the extent the cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests have not otherwise been applied to the making of Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (c)(ii) of the preceding paragraph or clause (2) of this paragraph;
(5) the repurchase of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon the exercise of stock options to the extent such Equity Interests represent a portion of the exercise price of those stock options;

Any such Lien thereby created in favor of the Notes or any such Note Guarantee pursuant to the preceding clause (1)(b) will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the initial Lien to which it relates or (ii) as otherwise provided under "--Security--Release".
The Parent will not, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien upon any shares of Capital Stock of the Parent, other than Permitted Collateral Liens.
Dividend and other payment restrictions affecting Restricted Subsidiaries
The Parent will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

Merger, consolidation or sale of assets

Neither the Issuer nor the Parent, will, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not the Issuer or the Parent, as the case may be, is the surviving corporation), or (2) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer or the Parent, as the case may be, and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:
(1) either: (a) the Issuer or the Parent, as the case may be, is the surviving corporation; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer or the Parent, as the case may be) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made is an entity organized or existing under the laws of any member state of the Pre-Expansion European Union, Switzerland, Canada, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;
(4) the Parent or, in case of a consolidation or merger or sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition by the Parent, the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Parent), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition has been made, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, (i) would be permitted to incur at least 1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in clause (1) of the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption "-- Incurrence o f Indebtedness and issuance o f preferred stock" or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and
170

(5) the Parent delivers to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel, in each case, stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture comply with this covenant and that the Notes, the supplemental indenture and the indenture constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer and the Parent or, as the case may be, the surviving entity; provided that in giving an opinion of counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to the satisfaction of clauses (3) and (4) above.
Subsidiary guarantors
A Subsidiary Guarantor may not sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person, other than another Subsidiary Guarantor, unless either (a) (i) the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of that Subsidiary Guarantor under its Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which such Subsidiary Guarantor is a party pursuant to a supplemental indenture and appropriate Security Documents reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and (ii) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; or (b) the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture.
General
Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of the properties and assets of it and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to any other Person.
For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer or a Guarantor, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable.
Upon any consolidation or merger, or any sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer or a Guarantor in a transaction that is subject to, and that complies with the provisions of this covenant, the successor Person formed by such consolidation or into or with which the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, is merged or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition, the provisions of the Indenture referring to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, shall refer instead to the successor Person and not to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be), and may exercise every right and power of the predecessor Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be, under the Indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person had been named as the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, therein; p ro v id e d that the relevant predecessor Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be, shall not be relieved from the obligation to pay the principal, interest or Additional Amounts on the Notes except in the case of a sale of all of the Issuer's or such Guarantor's, as the case may be, assets in a transaction that is subject to, and that complies with the provisions of, this covenant.
Clauses (3) and (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant will not apply to any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of any Restricted Subsidiary with or into the Issuer or the Parent and clause (4) of the first paragraph of this
171

covenant will not apply to any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of the Issuer or the Parent with or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer or the Parent, as the case may be, in another jurisdiction for tax reasons.
Transactions with Affiliates
The Parent will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any payment to or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Parent (each, an "Affiliate Transaction") involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of EUR3.0 million, unless:
(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm'slength basis; and
(2) the Parent delivers to the Trustee:
(a) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of EUR10.0 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Parent set forth in an Officer's Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with this covenant and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Parent; and, in addition,
(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of EUR20.0 million, an opinion of an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of international standing, or other recognized independent expert of international standing with experience appraising the terms and conditions of the type of transaction or series of related transactions for which an opinion is required, stating that the transaction or series of related transactions is (i) fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate.
The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:
(1) any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement, consultant, employee benefit arrangements with any employee, officer or director of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, including under any stock option, stock appreciation rights, stock incentive or similar plans, entered into in the ordinary course of business;
(2) transactions between or among (i) the Parent and/or the Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) any Person who is an Affiliate solely because a director of which is also a director of the Parent or any direct or indirect parent of the Parent; provided that such director abstains from voting as a director of the Parent or such direct or indirect parent, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other Person;
(3) transactions in the ordinary course of business with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Parent) that is an Affiliate of the Parent solely because the Parent owns, directly or through a Restricted Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person;
(4) payment of reasonable and customary fees and reimbursements of expenses (pursuant to indemnity arrangements or otherwise) of Officers, directors or employees of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;
172

(5) any issuance of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Parent to Affiliates of the Parent;

(7) Management Advances and the payment of any Management Fees;
(8) any Permitted Investments (other than Permitted Investments described in clauses (3), and (16) of the definition thereof);
(9) the incurrence of any Subordinated Shareholder Debt;
(10) transactions pursuant to, or contemplated by any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and transactions pursuant to any amendment, modification or extension to such agreement, so long as such amendment, modification or extension, taken as a whole, is not more disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes than the original agreement as in effect on the Issue Date;
(11) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture that are fair to the Parent or the Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the members of the Board of Directors of the Parent or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person;
(12) any payments or other transactions pursuant to a tax sharing agreement between the Parent and any other Person or a Subsidiary and any other Person with which the Parent or any Subsidiary files a consolidated tax return or with which the Parent or any Subsidiary is part of a group for tax purposes or any tax advantageous group contribution made pursuant to applicable legislation; p ro v id e d , h o w e ver, that any such tax sharing or arrangement and payment does not permit or require payments in excess of the amounts of tax that would be payable by the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis;
(13) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Transaction; and
(14) pledges of Equity Interests of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to secure Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary.
Designation of restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries
The Board of Directors of the Parent may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption " -- R estricte d p a ym en ts" or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Parent. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Parent may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Parent as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer's Certificate certifying that such designation complied
173

with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption " --R estricte d p a ym en ts". If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption " -- Incu rrence o f In d e b te d n e ss a n d issuance o f p re fe r re d sto c k ", the Parent will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Parent may at anytime designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; p ro v id e d that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption " --Incurrence o f In d e b te d n e ss and issuance o f p re fe rre d sto c k ", calculated on a p ro form a basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
Maintenance of listing
The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the admission to trading of the Notes on the Euro MTF Market for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer determines that it is unable to list or it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and withdrawal from trading of the Notes on the Euro MTF Market, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on another internationally recognized stock exchange or exchange regulated market in western Europe.
Limitation on issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness
The Parent will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer) that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee the payment of, assume or in any manner become liable with respect to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture providing for the Note Guarantee of the payment of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Guarantee will be senior to or p a ri passu with such Restricted Subsidiary's Guarantee of such other Indebtedness.
Simultaneously with the execution of such supplemental indenture, the Parent will cause all of the Capital Stock in such Restricted Subsidiary owned by the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries to be pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees.
Each additional Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to any Guarantees of any Restricted Subsidiary given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less than EUR250 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee was given, of at least A or the equivalent thereof by S&P and at least A2 or the equivalent thereof by Moody's, in connection with the operation of cash management programs established in the ordinary course of business for the benefit of the Parent or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in a violation of applicable law or any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary that, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through measures reasonably available to the Parent or the Restricted Subsidiary.
174

Payments for consent
The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture, to exclude holders of Notes in any jurisdiction where (A)(i) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (ii) the payment of the consideration therefor would require the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its member states), which the Parent in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (B) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.
Lines of business
The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a Permitted Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Limitation on permitted activities
The Parent or the Issuer must not carry on any business or own any assets other than:
(1) the ownership of Capital Stock of their respective Subsidiaries;
(2) the provision of administrative services (excluding treasury services) and management services to its Subsidiaries of a type customarily provided by a holding company to its Subsidiaries and activities reasonably incidental to such services (including entering into contracts with employees) and the ownership of assets necessary to provide such services as well as other normal holding company activities in the ordinary course of business;
(3) incurring Indebtedness or other obligations permitted under the covenant described above under the caption "--Incu rren ce o f In d e b te d n e ss a n d issuance o f p re fe r re d sto c k " (including the provision of Guarantees and activities reasonably incidental thereto, including performance of the terms and conditions of such Indebtedness, to the extent such activities are otherwise permissible under the Indenture) and the granting of Liens permitted under the covenant described above under the caption "--Liens" and entering into any agreements reasonably incidental thereto;
(4) rights and obligations arising under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents, the Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility and any employee incentive scheme;
(5) the ownership of cash and Cash Equivalents;
(6) making Investments in the Notes or other Indebtedness, p ro v id e d such Investments are otherwise permitted under the Indenture;
(7) directly related or reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of its or its Subsidiaries corporate existence (and providing performance guarantees, providing loans to its Subsidiaries or subscribing to equity of the Issuer);
175

(8) without prejudice to the limitation on carrying on any business or owning any assets, making any Investment or other Restricted Payment, in either case, that does not violate the provisions of the Indenture described above under the caption " -- R estricte d p a y m e n ts";
(9) own, lease, manage or otherwise operate any properties or assets related to administrative employees and functions incidental to its existence or properties and assets related to the business or operations set forth in clause (1) to (7) of this covenant; or
(10) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are de m inim is in nature.
Impairment of security interest
(a) The Parent will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, and, with respect to the Issuer Share Pledge Agreement, the Parent will not, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission might or would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and the Parent will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, and, with respect to the Issuer Share Pledge Agreement, the Parent will not, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral; p ro v id e d that nothing in this provision shall restrict (a) the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries from incurring Permitted Collateral Liens; and p ro v id e d , fu rth er, that no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, renewal or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Issuer delivers to the Trustee either (1) a solvency opinion from an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee confirming the solvency of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors or chief financial officer of the relevant Person, which certificate confirms the solvency of the Person granting such security interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, or (3) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes created under the Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced or release and retaking are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking.
(b) At the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the holders of Notes, the Security Agent may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security Documents (or enter into additional or supplemental security documents) to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (ii) (but subject to compliance with
176

paragraph (a) above) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens, (iii) add to the Collateral or (iv) make any other change thereto that does not, in the opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Notes in any material respect.
(c) In the event that the Issuer complies with this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release with no need for instructions from holders of the Notes.
Additional intercreditor agreements
At the request of the Issuer and upon delivery of an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee and the Security Agent, without the consent of holders of the Notes, and at the time of, or prior to, the incurrence by the Issuer or a Guarantor of Indebtedness permitted pursuant to (x) the covenant described under "--Incu rrence o f In d eb ted n ess a n d issuance o f p re fe rre d sto ck " and (y) any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x) the Issuer, the relevant Guarantor, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an "Additional Intercreditor Agreement") on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement, including terms with respect to the limitation on enforcement and release of guarantees and priority as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement (or on terms more favorable to the holders of the Notes); p ro v id e d , that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement or, to the extent applicable, an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall be deemed to have consented on behalf of the holders of the Notes to any payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under "--R estricte d p a ym en ts".

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, neither the Parent nor any Restricted Subsidiary may designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to definition of Unrestricted Subsidiary.
If and while the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the "Reversion Date") one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this "D escrip tio n o f N otes" as the "Suspension Period". Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from Net Proceeds shall be reset to zero.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes; p ro v id e d that (i) with respect to Restricted Payments made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described below under "--R estricted pa ym en ts" had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period; (ii) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (2) of the definition of Permitted Debt; (iii) any transactions with Affiliates entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be
178

permitted pursuant to clause (10) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "-- Transactions w ith A ffilia te s"; (iv) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under "--D ividen d a n d o th e r p a y m en t restriction s a ffe ctin g R estricte d Su bsidiaries" that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "--D ividen d a n d o th e r p a y m e n t restrictio n s a ffe ctin g R estricte d Su b sid ia ries"; and (v) no Restricted Subsidiary shall be required to comply with the covenant described under "-- Lim itation on issuances o f G uarantees o f In d e b te d n e ss" after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee entered into by such Restricted Subsidiary during any Suspension Period.
The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the two conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this heading have been satisfied, provided that such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of the covenants set forth above to be effective.
There can be no assurance that the Notes will achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating.
Reports
For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports in electronic form:
(1) within 120 days after the end of the Parent's fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014, annual reports containing the following information with a level of detail that is substantially comparable and similar in scope to this Offering Memorandum: (a) audited consolidated balance sheet of the Parent as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Parent for the three most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) p ro form a income statement and balance sheet information of the Parent, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions or dispositions (including, without limitation, any acquisitions or dispositions that, individually or in the aggregate when considered with all other acquisitions or dispositions that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates, represent greater than 20% of the consolidated revenues, EBITDA, or assets of the Parent on a p ro form a basis) or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates, in each case unless p ro form a information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below; (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations (including a discussion by business segment), financial condition and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (d) a description of the industry, business, management and shareholders of the Parent, all material affiliate transactions, Indebtedness and material financing arrangements and a description of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; and (e) material risk factors and material recent developments;

179

report relates, represent greater than 20% of the consolidated revenues, EBITDA or assets of the Parent on a pro forma basis) or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report relates, unless pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (1), (2) or (3) of this covenant; (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements (including a discussion by business segment), including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Parent and any material change between the current quarterly period and the corresponding period of the prior year; (d) material developments in the business of the Parent and its Subsidiaries; and (e) any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent annual report with respect to the Parent; and
(3) promptly after the occurrence of (a) a material acquisition, disposition or restructuring (including any acquisition or disposition that would require the delivery of p ro form a financial information pursuant to clauses (1) or (2) above); (b) any senior management change at the Parent; (c) any change in the auditors of the Parent; (d) the entering into an agreement that will result in a Change of Control; or (e) any material events that the Parent announces publicly, in each case, a report containing a description of such events,

If the Parent has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Subsidiaries are Significant Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Parent.
All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS. Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements for the Parent or Subsidiaries of the Parent or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum.
In addition, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer has agreed that it will furnish to the holders of the Notes and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.
So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Parent will also:
(a) within 10 Business Days after furnishing to the Trustee the annual and quarterly reports required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, hold a conference call to discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant reporting period; and
(b) issue a press release to an internationally recognized wire service no fewer than three Business Days prior to the date of the conference call required by the foregoing clause (a) of this paragraph, announcing the time and date of such conference call and either including all information necessary to access the call or directing holders of the Notes, prospective investors, broker dealers and securities analysts to contact the appropriate person at the Parent to obtain such information.
The Issuer will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant (i) on a website maintained by the Parent or any of its Affiliates and (ii) if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, at the specified office of the paying agent in Luxembourg or to the extent and in the manner required by such rules, post such reports on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (w w w .b o u rse .lu ).

Events of default and remedies
Each of the following is an "Event of Default":
(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to the Notes;
(2) default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the principal of, or premium, if any, on, the Notes;
(3) failure by the Issuer or relevant Guarantor to comply with the provisions described under the caption " -- Certain co ven ants--M e rg e r, co n so lid a tio n o r sale o f a sse ts";
(4) failure by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after written notice to the Issuer by the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class to comply with any of the agreements in the Indenture (other than a default in performance, or breach, of a covenant or agreement which is specifically dealt with in clauses (1), (2) or (3) above) or the Notes, the Note Guarantees, any Security Document or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture);
(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, if that default:
(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal or premium, if any, on such Indebtedness at the Stated Maturity thereof, prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a "Payment Default"); or
(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity,
and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates EUR20.0 million or more;
(6) failure by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay final judgments entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of EUR20.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments shall not have been discharged or waived and there shall have been a period of 60 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of an appeal, waiver or otherwise, shall not have been in effect;
(7) (i) breach by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of any material representation, warranty or agreement in any Security Document; p ro v id e d that if such breach is curable under each Security Document pursuant to which such breach occurred, such breach has continued uncured for a period of 15 days; (ii) any security interest created by the Security Documents with respect to Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of 5.0 million ceases to be in full force and effect (except as permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents), or an assertion by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary that any Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of EUR5.0 million is not subject to a valid, perfected security interest (except as permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement); or (iii) the repudiation by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of any of its material obligations under any Security Document;
181

(8) except as permitted by the Indenture, any Note Guarantee is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee; and
(9) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the Parent, the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.
In the case of an Event of Default specified in clause (9) of the preceding paragraph, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may, and the Trustee, upon request of such holders, shall, declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.
Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such holders have offered to the Trustee, and it has received, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except (subject to the provisions described under "A m e n d m e n t, su p p le m e n t an d w a iv er") to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:
(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
(2) holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3) such holders have offered the Trustee, and it has received, security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
(5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.
The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding may, on behalf of the holders of all outstanding Notes, waive any past default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of premium, if any, any Additional Amounts or interest on any Note held by a non-consenting holder (which may only be waived with the consent of each holder of Notes affected).
The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture.
No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and stockholders
No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
182

obligations or their creation. Each holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under applicable securities laws.
Legal defeasance and covenant defeasance
The Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officer's Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes and all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Note Guarantees ("Legal Defeasance") except for:
(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts) or premium, if any, on, such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;
(2) the Issuer's obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;
(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer's and the Guarantors' obligations in connection therewith; and
(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.
In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation to make Change of Control Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Indenture ("Covenant Defeasance") and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all Events of Default described under " -- Even ts o f D e fa u lt a n d rem ed ies" (except those relating to payments on the Notes or, bankruptcy or insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:
(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or such other entity designated or appointed (as agent) by it for such purpose, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in Euro, Euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination of cash in Euro and Euro-denominated European Government Obligations in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts and premium, if any) on the outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a particular redemption date;
(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion reasonably acceptable to the Trustee of United States counsel confirming that (a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion reasonably acceptable to the Trustee of United States counsel confirming that the holders of
183

the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
(4) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer, the Guarantors or others; and
(5) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel, subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.
Amendment, supplement and waiver
Except as provided otherwise in the succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).
Unless consented to by the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), an amendment, supplement or waiver may not:
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described above under the caption " -- R epu rch ase a t th e o p tio n o f h o ld e rs");
(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Note;
(4) impair the right of any holder of Notes to receive payment of principal of and interest on such holder's Notes on or after the due dates therefore or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder's Notes or any Guarantee in respect thereof;
(5) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or premium, if any, on, the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the Payment Default that resulted from such acceleration);
(6) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;
(7) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or premium, if any, on, the Notes;
(8) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by one of the covenants described above under the caption " -- R epurchase a t the o p tio n o f h o ld e rs");
184

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;
(10) release any Liens on the Collateral granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the relevant Security Document and the Intercreditor Agreement;
(11) change the ranking of the Notes or the Note Guarantees; or
(12) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.
Any amendment, supplement or waiver consented to by at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will be binding against any non-consenting holders.
Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document to which they are party:
(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;
(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;
(3) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer's or a Guarantor's obligations to holders of Notes and Note Guarantees in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Issuer's or such Guarantor's assets, as applicable;
(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such holder in any material respect;
(5) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, any Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement to any provision of this "D escrip tio n o f N otes" to the extent that such provision in this "D escrip tio n o f N otes" was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Security Documents, or the Intercreditor Agreement;
(6) to enter into additional or supplemental Security Documents;
(7) to release any Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;
(8) to release the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;
(9) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the Indenture as of the Issue Date;
(10) to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Note Guarantee with respect to the Notes;
(11) to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee under the Indenture; or
(12) to add additional parties to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document to the extent permitted hereunder and thereunder.
The consent of the holders of Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.
In connection with its entry into any amendment, supplement or waiver, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an opinion of counsel and an Officer's Certificate.
185

Satisfaction and discharge
The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder, when:
(1) either:
(a) all Notes that have been authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer, have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or
(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the giving of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee or such other entity designated or appointed (as agent) by it for such purpose as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders, cash in Euro, Euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination of cash in Euro and Euro-denominated European Government Obligations, in amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation of principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;
(2) the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and
(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be.
In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied; p ro v id e d that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).
Judgment currency
The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer or a Guarantor under the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees is Euro. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than Euro in respect of the Notes (whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Parent, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by a Holder or by the Trustee in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will constitute a discharge of the Issuer and the Guarantors only to the extent of the Euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any event the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase.
For the purposes of this indemnity, it will be sufficient for the Holder or the Trustee to certify that it would have suffered a loss had an actual purchase of Euro been made with the amount so received in that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of Euro on such date had not been practicable, on the first date on which it would have been practicable). These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the other obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder or the Trustee (other than a waiver of
186

the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect to any sum due under any Note, any Guarantee or any other judgment or order.
Concerning the trustee
The Issuer shall deliver written notice to the Trustee within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest in its capacity as Trustee it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee.
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.
The Issuer and the Guarantors jointly and severally will indemnify the Trustee for certain claims, liabilities and expenses incurred without gross negligence, or willful misconduct, or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with its duties.

Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations
TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH TREASURY DEPARTMENT CIRCULAR 230, HOLDERS ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT: (A) ANY DISCUSSION OF U.S. FEDERAL TAX ISSUES IN THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE RELIED UPON, AND CANNOT BE RELIED UPON, BY HOLDERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON HOLDERS UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE; (B) SUCH DISCUSSION IS INCLUDED HEREIN BY THE ISSUER IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING (WITHIN THE MEANING OF CIRCULAR 230) BY THE ISSUER OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS ADDRESSED HEREIN; AND (C) HOLDERS SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISER.
it it it it it
The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below). This summary deals only with initial investors in Notes who will hold Notes as capital assets and who purchase Notes at the "issue price," which will equal the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes is sold to the public (not including bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). The discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors, and does not address state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws (including the alternative minimum tax or the net investment income tax). This summary also does not discuss all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types of investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as financial institutions, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt organisations, dealers in securities or currencies, investors that will hold the Notes as part of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar).
As used herein, the term "U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created or organised under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has validly elected to be treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds Notes will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Prospective purchasers that are entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes should consult their tax advisers concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by the partnership.
214

This summary is based on the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, all as of the date hereof and all subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.
THE SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET OUT BELOW IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF ACQUIRING, OWNING, AND DISPOSING OF THE NOTES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN TAX LAW.
Payments of interest
General. Interest on a Note will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on such holder's method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes constitutes income from sources outside the United States. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisers concerning the applicability of the foreign tax credit and source of income rules to income attributable to the Notes.
Foreign Currency Denominated Interest. The amount of income recognised by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the euro received is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.
An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognised with respect to an interest payment denominated in euro in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable year).
Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within each taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS").
Upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or retirement of a Note) denominated in euro, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may recognise U.S. source exchange gain or loss (generally taxable as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the amount previously accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.
Sale and retirement of the Notes
A U.S. Holder generally will recognise gain or loss on the sale or retirement of a Note equal to the difference between the amount realised on the sale or retirement and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis of the Note. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be its U.S. dollar cost (as defined below). The U.S. dollar cost of a Note purchased with euro generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price on the date of purchase. The amount realised does not include the amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as
215

interest income to the extent not previously included in income. The amount realised on a sale or retirement for an amount in euro will be the U.S. dollar value of this amount on the date of sale or retirement, or the settlement date for the sale, in the case of Notes traded on an established securities market, within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations, sold by a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects).
A U.S. Holder will recognise U.S. source exchange rate gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) on the sale or retirement of a Note equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar values of the U.S. Holder's purchase price for the Note (i) on the date of sale or retirement and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. Any such exchange rate gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of accrued but unpaid interest) will be realised only to the extent of total gain or loss realised on the sale or retirement. Except to the extent of changes in exchange rates, gain or loss recognised by a U.S. Holder on the sale or retirement of a Note will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year.
Gain or loss realised by a U.S. Holder on the sale or retirement of a Note generally will be U.S. source. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisers as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale or retirement of Notes.
Disposition of foreign currency
Foreign currency received as interest on a Note or on the sale or retirement of a Note will have a tax basis equal to its U.S. dollar value at the time the foreign currency is received. Foreign currency that is purchased generally will have a tax basis equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of purchase. Any gain or loss recognised on a sale or other disposition of a foreign currency (including its use to purchase Notes or upon exchange for U.S. dollars) generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.
Backup withholding and information reporting
Payments of principal and interest on, and the proceeds of sale, retirement or other disposition of Notes, by a U.S. paying agent or other U.S. intermediary will be reported to the IRS and to the U.S. Holder as may be required under applicable regulations. Backup withholding may apply to these payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fails to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal income tax returns. Certain U.S. Holders are not subject to backup withholding. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption.
Reportable transactions
A U.S. taxpayer that participates in a "reportable transaction" will be required to disclose its participation to the IRS. Under the relevant rules, if the Notes are denominated in a foreign currency, a U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from the Notes as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the regulations (U.S.$50,000 in a single taxable year, if the U.S. Holder is an individual or trust, or higher amounts for other non-individual U.S. Holders), and to disclose its investment by filing Form 8886 with the IRS. A penalty in the amount of U.S.$10,000 in the case of a natural person and U.S.$50,000 in all other cases generally is imposed on any taxpayer that fails to timely file an information return with the IRS with respect to a transaction resulting in a loss that is treated as a reportable transaction. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the application of these rules.
216

Foreign financial asset reporting
U.S. taxpayers that own certain foreign financial assets, including debt of foreign entities, with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000 at the end of the taxable year or $75,000 at any time during the taxable year (or, for certain individuals living outside the United States and married individuals filing joint returns, certain higher thresholds) may be required to file an information report on IRS Form 8938 with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The Notes are expected to constitute foreign financial assets subject to these requirements unless the Notes are held in an account at a financial institution (in which case the account may be reportable if maintained by a foreign financial institution). U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the application of the rules relating to foreign financial asset reporting.

The following summary of certain tax considerations that may arise as a result of holding Notes is based on current Swedish tax legislation and is intended only as general information for Noteholders who are resident in Sweden for tax purposes, unless otherwise indicated. This description does not deal comprehensively with all tax consequences that may occur for Noteholders and is neither intended to be nor should be construed as legal or tax advice. For instance, it does not cover the specific rules where Notes are held by a partnership or as current assets in a business operation. Moreover, the description does not address situations where Notes are held in an investment savings account (Sw. investeringssparkonto). Special tax consequences that are not described below may also apply for certain categories of taxpayers, including investment companies and mutual funds. Prospective purchasers of Notes should consult their own tax advisers for information with respect to the special tax consequences that may arise as a result of acquiring, holding and disposing of Notes, including the applicability and effect of foreign income tax rules, provisions in double taxation treaties and other rules which may be applicable.
Taxation of individuals tax resident in Sweden
Capital gains a n d losses. Individuals who sell their Notes, or have their Notes redeemed or bought back, are subject to capital gains tax. The tax rate is 30%.
The capital gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the sales (or redemption) proceeds, after deduction of sales costs, and the Notes' acquisition cost for tax purposes. The acquisition cost is determined according to the "average method". This means that the acquisition value for all Notes of the same class and type shall be added together and computed collectively, with respect to changes to the holding.
Gains or losses on currency exchange rate fluctuations may arise in relation to Notes where the sales proceeds received are in a foreign currency. However, no special calculations are required if the sales proceeds are exchanged into SEK within 30 days from the time of disposal. In such case, the exchange rate on the date of exchange shall be used when calculating the value of the sales proceeds. The exchange rate on the date of acquisition is generally used when determining the acquisition cost for tax purposes.
As a general rule, 70% of a capital loss is deductible against any other taxable income from capital. However, capital losses on listed Swedish receivables are fully deductible in the income from capital category. According to Swedish case law, full deductibility also applies to capital losses on listed foreign receivables.
If a net loss arises in the income from capital category, a reduction of the tax on income from employment and from business operations, as well as the tax on real estate and the municipal real estate fee, is allowed. The tax reduction is 30% of any part of the net loss not exceeding SEK100,000 and 21% of any part of the net loss in excess of SEK100,000. An excess net loss may not be carried forward to a subsequent fiscal year.
217

In terest. Any interest income received by an individual Noteholder is subject to Swedish tax at a tax rate of 30% in the income from capital category. Interest income is taxable when the income can be disposed of. W ith h oldin g o f tax on in te re st. The legal entity effecting an interest payment to an individual (or an estate of a deceased individual) will normally be required to withhold Swedish preliminary tax (Sw. p relim in a rska tt). The preliminary tax so withheld is normally equal to the final tax on the interest income, which means that there is generally no further tax payable on the interest.
Taxation of Swedish limited liability companies For limited liability companies (Sw. a ktieb o la g ), all income, including interest and capital gains on the Notes, is taxed as income from business operations at a rate of 22%. Deductible capital losses on the Notes may normally be fully off-set in the income from business operations category. Interest income and currency exchange fluctuations are normally taxable, or deductible, as the case may be, on an accrual basis. Specific rules may apply to Notes held as a hedge for foreign currency exposure.
Taxation of Noteholders that are not tax resident in Sweden Payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a Noteholder are not subject to Swedish income tax, provided that such a holder is not resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and provided that such a holder does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the Notes are effectively connected. Under domestic tax rules, an individual is resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes if he/she (i) is domiciled in Sweden; (ii) has its habitual abode in Sweden; or (iii) has been domiciled earlier in Sweden and, after having moved abroad, continues to have an essential connection with Sweden. A limited liability company is tax resident in Sweden if it is incorporated under the laws of Sweden. Swedish withholding tax, or Swedish tax deduction, is not imposed on payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to a non resident Noteholder. Noteholders of who are not resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and who are not carrying on business operations from a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the Notes are attributable are generally not liable for Swedish capital gains taxation on the disposal of Notes. The Noteholders may be subject to tax in their country of residence.

Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on validity and enforceability of the guarantees and security interests
The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Sweden, and the Guarantors are registered under the laws of Sweden, Finland and Germany.
European Union
Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the "EU Insolvency Regulation"), the court that shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company in the court of the EU Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its "centre of main interest" (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its "centre of main interest" is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.
The term "centre of main interest" is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its "centre of main interests" in the EU Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the "centre of main interest" of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the perception of the company's creditors as regards the centre of the company's business operations may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its "centre of main interest."
If the "centre of main interest" of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings with respect to the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one EU Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another EU Member State. If the "centre of main interest" of a debtor is in one EU Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open "territorial proceedings" only in the event that such debtor has an "establishment" in the territory of such other EU Member State. An "establishment" is defined to mean a place of operations where the company carries on non transitory economic activity with human means and goods. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other EU Member State. Where main proceedings have been opened in the EU Member State in which the company has its center of main interests, any proceedings opened subsequently in another EU Member State in which the company has an "establishment" (secondary proceedings) are limited to "winding up proceedings" listed in Annex B of the EU Insolvency Regulation.
Where main proceedings in the EU Member State in which the company has its "center of main interests" have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another EU Member State where the company has an establishment if either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU Member State in which the company's "center of main interests" is situated under that EU Member State's law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor which is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the other EU Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the "establishment".
219

If the company does not have an establishment in any other EU Member State, no court of any other EU Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings with respect to such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation.
The courts of all EU Member States (other than Denmark) must give to the judgment of the court of the main proceedings the same effect in all EU Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The liquidator appointed by a court in a EU Member State which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company's "center of main interests" is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that EU Member State in another EU Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other EU Member State) subject to certain limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU Member State where the company has assets.
Any EU Member State may refuse to recognize insolvency proceedings opened in another EU Member State or to enforce a judgment handed down in the context of such proceedings where the effects of such recognition or enforcement would be manifestly contrary to that State's public policy, in particular its fundamental principles or the constitutional rights and liberties of the individual.
In the event that the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer.
Sweden
Applicable insolvency law
The Issuer and the Swedish guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Sweden and as such any insolvency proceedings applicable to the Issuer and the Swedish guarantor including any and all of its assets (in Sweden and abroad) will, as a matter of Swedish law, be governed by Swedish insolvency law (Sw. le x fo ri concursus).
In addition, a Swedish party will in principle be subject to insolvency proceedings covered by the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency proceedings (the "Insolvency Regulation") (which includes all collective insolvency proceedings available under Swedish law in respect of bodies corporate) if it has its center of main interest ("COMI") in Sweden. The COMI is presumed, in the case of a company or body corporate, to be the place of its registered office. Accordingly, if the Swedish party is registered in Sweden, Swedish courts will be entitled to open main insolvency proceedings against it and apply the laws of the relevant insolvency proceedings. If the COMI of a debtor is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) may open "territorial insolvency proceedings" or, after the commencement of main proceedings, "secondary insolvency proceedings," in the event that such debtor possesses an "establishment" in the territory of such other Member State.
Under Swedish law, a debtor company may be subject to two types of insolvency proceedings: bankruptcy pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (Sw. K onku rslag (1987:672)), as amended (the "Swedish Bankruptcy Act"), and reorganization pursuant to the Swedish Company Reorganization Act (Sw. Lag (1996:764) om fo re ta g srek o n stru k tio n ), as amended (the "Swedish Reorganisation Act").
Bankruptcy pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act
G eneral. Pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act, if a company is unable to pay its debts when they fall due and such inability is not merely temporary, it is deemed insolvent and can be declared bankrupt following a bankruptcy petition filed with the court by the debtor or by a creditor of the debtor (who does not have satisfactory security for its claim).
220

In the event of bankruptcy the court will appoint a receiver in bankruptcy (Sw. ko n ku rsf rva lta re) who will work in the interest of all creditors with the objective of selling the debtor's assets and distributing the proceeds among the creditors.
The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings are to wind up the company in such a way that the company's creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business for a certain period or to close it down, depending on what the receiver considers best for all creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to distribute the proceeds in accordance with the mandatory priority rules. In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the company. The company's directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or dispose of the company's assets. A creditor having security over a real property or a movable asset may demand that such asset be sold by the receiver without undue delay, provided the underlying claim is not disputed or has been confirmed in a non-appealable decision. This rule does not, however, apply to property that is necessary for the continuation of the debtor's business. The receiver may thus postpone such sale if the receiver determines that the bankruptcy estate would either incur a considerable loss or that the implementation of a composition would become substantially more difficult, provided that a postponement is not unreasonable to the creditor. Enforcement of security in a bankruptcy is further described under the section titled "--Enforcement of security in bankruptcy" below.
E ffe c t o f b a n kru p tcy on th e b a n kru p tcy d e b to r's contracts. The declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts; instead, the receiver may, in relation to certain contracts, in its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself become party to any such existing contracts. A clause in such a contract which provides that the contract is terminated by reason of a bankruptcy petition or similar proceeding is likely to be deemed unenforceable. If the estate enters into such a contract and performance by the creditor is due, the creditor may generally demand that the estate perform its obligations as well or, if a grace period has been granted, request that the estate, without unreasonable delay, provide acceptable security for its performance. If performance by the creditor is not due, the creditor may request security where this is necessary in order to protect the creditor against loss. If the estate does not enter into the contract within a reasonable time after the creditor's demand or if it does not comply with the creditor's request to provide security, the creditor may terminate the contract.
O rd er o f p rio ritie s. When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish Rights of Priority Act (Sw. Frm nsrttslag (1970:979)), as amended (the "Swedish Rights of Priority Act"), which states the order in which creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have equal right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor's assets. However, preferential or secured creditors have the benefit of payment before other creditors. Moreover, the priority of a claim could also be affected if it is subordinated, for instance, if the creditor has entered into an agreement stipulating such subordination.
There are two types of preferential rights: specific and general preferential rights. Specific preferential rights apply to certain specific property and give the creditor a right to payment from such property. General preferential rights cover all property belonging to the insolvent company's estate in bankruptcy, which is not covered by specific preferential rights, and give the creditor a right to payment derived from such property. Claims that do not carry any of the above mentioned preferential rights or exceed the value of the security provided for such claim (to the extent of such excess), are non-preferential and are of equal standing as against each other.
Reorganization of a company pursuant to the Swedish Reorganization Act
G eneral. The Swedish Reorganization Act provides companies facing difficulty in meeting their payment obligations with an opportunity to resolve these obligations without being declared
221

bankrupt. The debtor or a creditor of a debtor may petition for company reorganization. If a creditor petitions for company reorganization the debtor's consent to the reorganization is required. Prerequisites for an approval of a petition for company reorganization is that it can be assumed that the debtor is unable to pay its due debts or such inability will occur shortly and there is a possibility that the reorganization will be successful in resolving the company's financial difficulties. Corporate reorganization proceedings shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months from commencement but may under certain conditions be extended for up to one year.
A d m in istra to r. An administrator is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities of the debtor in order to accomplice the reorganization and safeguards the interests of creditors. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except that, for important decisions such as (i) paying a debt or granting security for a debt that arose prior to the order of reorganization, (ii) assume new obligations or (iii) transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of significant importance to the business, the consent of the administrator is required. However, the absence of such consent does not affect the validity of the transaction.
R eo rg a n iza tion p la n , cre d ito rs' m ee tin g a n d cre d ito rs' co m m ittee. Upon opening of corporate reorganization proceedings, the administrator must notify the creditors of the reorganization proceedings and will draw up a reorganization plan specifying the proposed action to be taken to resolve the debtor's financial difficulties. A creditors' meeting will be held at which the creditors will be given the opportunity to express their opinions as to whether the reorganization should continue. Upon the request of any of the creditors, the court shall appoint a creditors' committee. The administrator shall, if possible, consult with the creditors' committee prior to taking any important decisions.
M o rato riu m . The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating contracts with the debtor. Furthermore, the opening of corporate reorganization proceedings entails limitations on the contracting party's right to terminate a contract due to the debtor's delay. Such limitations are similar to what is stated above in respect of a bankruptcy estate's right to enter into existing contracts. However, the limitations are not applicable where a creditor has security over, inter alia, financial instruments or receivables originating from a loan granted by a credit institution. During the reorganization procedure, the debtor's business activities continue in the ordinary course of business. However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor will subject to certain exceptions be stayed. Moreover, the debtor may not pay a debt that fell due prior to the order without the consent of the administrator. Such consent may only be granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so. A moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security during corporate reorganization proceedings unless the security assets are in the physical possession of the secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such creditor, which is for example the case with a share pledge over the shares in a Swedish limited liability company where the share certificates of such company have been physically delivered to the secured creditor or the agent.
Public com position proceedings. A debtor may apply to the court requesting public composition proceedings (Sw. o ffen tlig ta cko rd ), which means that the amount of a creditor's claim may be reduced. The proposal for a public composition must meet certain requirements, such as that a sufficient proportion of the creditors which are allowed to vote, in respect of a sufficient proportion of the outstanding claims vote in favor of such public composition. Creditors with set-off rights and secured creditors will not participate in the composition unless they wholly or partly waive their set off rights or priority rights. Should the security not cover a secured creditor's full claim, the remaining claim will, however, be part of the composition. A specific creditors' meeting is convened to vote on the proposed composition. The public composition is binding on all creditors that were entitled to participate, i.e., also creditors who have not attended the creditors' meeting will be bound. The obligations of a guarantor under a guarantee provided in respect of a creditor's claim which has been reduced by way of public composition will not be reduced correspondingly but will remain valid up to the original amount of such creditor's claim.
222

Liquidation due to capital deficiency
Pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. A k tieb o la g sla g (2005:551)), as amended (the "Swedish Companies Act"), whenever a company's board of directors has a reason to assume that, as a result of losses or reductions in the value of the company's assets or any other event, the company's equity is less than half the registered share capital, the company's board of directors shall prepare a special balance sheet (Sw. kon trollbalansrakn in g) and have the auditors examine it. The same obligation arises if the company in connection with enforcement pursuant to Chapter 4 of the Swedish Enforcement Code (Sw. U tsokn in gsbalk (1981:774)) is found to lack sizable assets. If the special balance sheet shows that the equity of such company is less than half of the registered share capital, the board of directors shall, as soon as possible, issue notice to call a shareholders' meeting which shall consider whether the company shall go into liquidation (initial shareholders' meeting). The special balance sheet and an auditor's report with respect thereto shall be presented at the initial shareholders' meeting.
If the special balance sheet presented at the initial shareholders' meeting fails to show that, on the date of such meeting, the equity of the company amounts to the registered share capital and the initial shareholders' meeting has not resolved that the company shall go into liquidation, the shareholders' meeting shall, within eight months of the initial shareholders' meeting, reconsider the issue whether the company shall go into liquidation (second shareholders' meeting). Prior to the second shareholders' meeting, the board of directors shall prepare a new special balance sheet and cause such to be reviewed by the company's auditors. The new special balance sheet and an auditor's report thereon shall be presented at the second shareholders' meeting. A shareholders' resolution on liquidation of the company shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. B o la g sverket), which shall appoint a liquidator. Should the shareholders not resolve on such voluntary liquidation where required (which are where (i) a second shareholders' meeting is not held within the period of time stated above, or (ii) the new special balance sheet which was presented at the second shareholders' meeting was not reviewed by the company's auditor or fails to show that, on the date of such meeting, the equity of the company amounts to at least the registered share capital), the court may put the company into compulsory liquidation and appoint a liquidator. The liquidator takes over management and control of the company and shall sell the company's assets and settle the company's debts with the proceeds. The liquidator shall give notice to the company's unknown creditors and creditors that have not lodged their claims with the liquidator within six months following such notice will have forfeited their rights to their claims.
Limitations on the validity and value of a guarantee or security interest
Certain provisions of the Swedish Companies Act may limit the holders of the Notes right to payment from Guarantors incorporated in Sweden. The Guarantees of and security granted by such Guarantors are limited in accordance with the below restrictions relating to corporate benefit and are subject to limitation language limiting the liability of such entities thereunder if required by the below restrictions relating to distribution of assets.
P ro h ib ited loans and secu rity. A Swedish limited liability company may not provide a guarantee or a pledge for the obligations of another company, unless they belong to the same group of companies and the parent company of that group is domiciled within the European Economic Area (EEA).
C orporate b e n e fit rules. Furthermore, if a Swedish limited liability company provides any security interest or guarantee for the obligations of another party without receiving sufficient corporate benefit in return, such security interest or guarantee will, in whole or in part, be considered a distribution of assets, which will be lawful only (i) to the extent there is sufficient coverage for the restricted equity capital of the Swedish limited liability company after the distribution (i.e., at the time the guarantee is provided or the security is granted) and (ii) if it is considered prudent by the Swedish limited liability company to undertake such distribution after having taken into
223

consideration the equity requirements imposed by the nature, scope and risks relating to the Swedish limited liability company's business or the Swedish limited liability company's need to strengthen its balance sheet, liquidity or financial position in general. Where the Swedish limited liability company is a parent company, the latter assessment is also made on a group level. A guarantee or security granted for a another party's obligation may also, in certain circumstances, be deemed to constitute a distribution of assets if, at the time the guarantee or security interest is provided, the obligor of such obligation could be deemed unable to fulfill its obligation to indemnify the Swedish limited liability company if the guarantee is utilized, the security is enforced or if the security provider does not otherwise receive corporate benefit.
Financial assistance. It should also be noted that laws relating to financial assistance in Sweden prohibit limited liability companies incorporated in Sweden from providing guarantees or granting security or other credit support for obligations of any person where such obligations are being incurred for the purpose of acquiring shares in the company itself or in any other superior member of the same group of companies and the parent company of that group is domiciled in Sweden.
Establishing a security interest
G eneral. In order to create a valid security interest under Swedish law, the asset subject to such security interest must meet the following criteria: (a) there must be an underlying debtorcreditor relationship in respect of the obligations which the security purports to secure; (b) the pledgor must grant the security interest, typically in the form of a pledge agreement; and (c) an act perfecting the security interest must take place. The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type.
Under Swedish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest by the secured party and the grantor, for any security to be validly created, the grantor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest. Any security interests purported to be created under Swedish law over assets which the security provider may remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from until the occurrence of an enforcement event would therefore not be effective until an enforcement event has occurred and the security interests have been perfected. Normally, a three month hardening period will apply following such delayed perfection. Such unperfected secured assets are vulnerable under applicable provisions of Swedish law of being set aside as a preference in any Swedish insolvency proceedings affecting the security provider. This will be the case for example for dividends pledged as Collateral under Security Documents governed by Swedish law to secure the Notes. Such security interests will not be perfected at the Issue Date, and not until an enforcement event occurs. Thus, a security provider must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the secured assets, and arrangements providing for the release of a security interest over an asset in connection with the disposal thereof or upon the occurrence of other circumstances would be at risk of impairing the validity of the security.
Shares. In the case of shares, the perfection of the pledge is achieved by transferring the share certificates in Sweden to the possession of the secured party in respect of a private limited liability company or a public limited liability company which is a coupon company (Sw. ku p o n g b o la g ). The secured party is not entitled to vote for the shares but is, absent agreement to the contrary, entitled to any bonus shares and any new shares issued in rights issues. Unless the secured party and the pledgor agree otherwise, the pledgor is entitled to all dividends until the bankruptcy date. The right to future dividends can however be pledged to the secured party or to a third party.
Claims in g en era l. Pledges can also be granted and perfected in receivables and other claims (including dividends). Security over receivables and claims is perfected by way of notification to the debtor of the underlying claim. There is no requirement as to the form for such notification. However, in order to obtain the intended result, the pledgor or the secured party should state that the claim has been pledged to the secured party and the notice must also effectively
224

prohibit the debtor of the underlying claim from paying the pledgor. The intra-group receivables (granted by each of the Issuer, Ovako Sweden AB and Ovako Bright Bar AB) and dividends pledged as Collateral under Security Documents governed by Swedish law to secure the Notes will not be perfected on the Issue Date, and will not be perfected until an enforcement event. For dividends security is perfected by way of notification to the company that dividends may not be paid to the pledgor.
Business m o rtg a g es a n d real p ro p e rty m o rtg a ges. In the case of Swedish business mortgages and real property mortgages, the perfection of the pledge is achieved by transferring the Swedish business mortgage certificates and real property mortgage certificates to the possession of the secured party.
Patents and tradem arks. In the case of patents and trademarks, the perfection of the pledge over Swedish patents and trademarks is achieved by register the pledge agreement with the Patent and Registration Office (Sw: Patent- och R eg istrerin g sverket) or in case of Community Trademarks) register the pledge agreement with the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market ("O H IM ").
Pre-bankruptcy enforcement
G eneral. In case of enforcement outside bankruptcy, an enforcement process is initiated by the creditor obtaining an enforcement order from the Swedish Enforcement Authority (Sw. K ro n o fo g d e n ) or a court judgment. Upon obtaining such enforceable instrument against a debtor, a creditor may apply to the Swedish Enforcement Authority for enforcement of its claim.
If (i) agreed upon between a pledgor and a secured party and (ii) the secured creditor or its agent is in physical possession of the security assets, the secured creditor or the agent may under certain circumstances enforce the pledge without having obtained an enforceable instrument. Certain categories of properties may however only be enforced through the Swedish Enforcement Authority (such as business mortgages and real property). Enforcement of security over shares, receivables, patents, trademarks and contractual rights can be carried out by the security holder itself. A provision granting the secured party or its agent such right of enforcement is typically included in any pledge agreement between the pledgor and the secured party or its agent. However, the secured party has a general duty of care (Sw. vrdplikt) towards the pledgor which implies, inter alia, that a fair market value should be obtained if the pledged asset is enforced and that the pledgor should be given prior notice (where reasonably practicable and not detrimental to the interests of the secured party) of the contemplated enforcement.
E n fo rce m e n t o f secu rity th rou g h sale. The secured party is typically entitled to enforce the security through a sale of the security asset. However, certain restrictions apply to the procedure for such a sale. The pledgor must be given prior notice of the contemplated enforcement and also of the time and location of the sale. Furthermore, sufficient notice must be given to prospective purchasers in order to create reasonable preconditions for a market price being obtained in the sale. Where the secured party has been granted the right to enforce the security through a private sale, such sale must be made to a party unaffiliated with the secured party unless the market price of the security can be independently and objectively established and the security is sold at such price. If the security involves bearer documents (for example share certificates) the bearer documents may have to be presented in Sweden.
Enforcement of security through collection of payment. Pledges over receivables and other claims are, if the receivable or claim has fallen due, primarily enforced through the secured party collecting the payment as opposed to selling the receivable.
Enforcement of security in bankruptcy
An enforcement in bankruptcy of a security interest in assets other than real property and business mortgages can in principle be carried out in the same manner as outside bankruptcy. However, where a security holder seeks to enforce such security itself, certain statutory notice requirements apply. A creditor holding a possessory pledge over moveable property may arrange
225

for the sale of the property at a public auction (but not sell the property privately unless the receiver consents). However, financial instruments and currency are exempt from the requirement for the receiver's consent. The secured party may either sell such assets immediately or assume ownership (against reduction of the secured debt with the market value of such assets or, if the market value of the assets exceeds the outstanding debt, against repayment to the debtor of the surplus), provided the realization is done in a commercially reasonable manner. Should the security consist of unlisted shares in the subsidiary of the debtor, the receiver must still be given an opportunity to redeem the shares prior to the sale or deduction.
Lim itatio n s on e n fo rc e a b ility o f claim s (in clu din g d ivid en d s) o f Sw ed ish g u a ra n tors. The security over intra-group receivables (granted by each of the Issuer, Ovako Sweden AB and Ovako Bright Bar AB) and dividends under Security Documents governed by Swedish law will be perfected at a later stage, which will increase the risk for recovery in an insolvency. In particular, under the Swedish Bankruptcy Act, in a bankruptcy or in a company reconstruction where a composition among creditors has been approved by the court, any security granted may be recovered if (a) it was not provided for at the time the debt it secured arose or if it was not perfected without delay following the coming into existence of such debt, unless in the circumstances it was nevertheless ordinary, and (b) it was granted later than three months before the "relevant date" (broadly, the date when the petition for bankruptcy or company reconstruction was lodged). Such security may also be recovered if provided to a related party earlier than three months but later than two years before the relevant date, unless it can be shown that the debtor was not insolvent at the time of the action and did not become insolvent as a result of it. The security over intra-group receivables (granted by each of the Issuer, Ovako Sweden AB and Ovako Bright Bar AB) and dividends will only be perfected at a later stage and will therefore be subject to the additional risk of recovery in a subsequent bankruptcy.
Recovery in bankruptcy and in reorganization
In bankruptcy and--if certain conditions are met--company reorganization proceedings, transactions can (in certain circumstances and subject to a time limit) be reversed and the assets shall then be returned to the bankruptcy estate or the company subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among others and subject to further prerequisites, situations where the debtor has (a) conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of its other creditors; (b) created a new security interest, granted a guarantee or security that was either not stipulated at the time when the secured obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time and the delay is not considered to be ordinary; or (c) paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable compared to the value of the debtor's assets or if the payment is made by using unusual means of payment. In the majority of situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions that were made during the three months preceding the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. In certain situations longer time limits apply and in others, there are no time limits. These include, among others, situations where the other party to an agreement or other arrangement is deemed to be a closely related party to the debtor, such as a subsidiary or parent company.
Foreign currency. Whereas Swedish courts may award judgments in currencies other than SEK, judgments will be enforced in Swedish Kronor, generally at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of enforcement rather than at the date of judgment.
Secu rity g ra n ted in fa vo r o f an a g en t. It is generally possible under Swedish law to grant security interests in favor of an agent acting on behalf of the secured parties. However, it is not established by judicial precedent or otherwise by law that a power of attorney or a mandate of agency, including the appointment of an agent (including any agent for service of process), can be made irrevocable. Therefore, any powers of attorney or mandates of agency may be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the party giving such powers.

Finland
There are two primary insolvency regimes under Finnish law. The first, company restructuring (Fi. yrityssaneeraus), is intended to investigate whether the business has a reasonable chance to continue and, if so, to rehabilitate the company's viable business, ensure its continued viability and make arrangements with creditors. The second, bankruptcy (Fi. konkurssi), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the assets of a debtor to its creditors.
Company restructuring
If a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, and it is likely that a company restructuring may remedy the insolvency or prevent its recurrence otherwise than for a short period, an application for company restructuring can be made to a court by the debtor or by one or more creditors. Furthermore, the initiation of restructuring proceedings is possible--in theory, irrespective of the company's solvency situation--when at least two creditors whose total claims represent at least one-fifth of the debtor's known debts and who are not related to the debtor file a joint application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor's application for company restructuring. If there are no specific legal barriers to company restructuring and, consequently, the court approves the application and initiates restructuring proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint an administrator (Fi. selvittaja).
The administrator appointed by the court looks after the creditors' interests in the restructuring proceedings, prepares an inventory of the company's assets and administration debts and prepares a proposal for the restructuring programme. The court will often appoint a creditors committee to assist and supervise the administrator. Despite the initiation of the restructuring proceedings, the directors of the company remain in control of the business but their powers are somewhat limited. The administrator supervises the operation of the company's business. After restructuring proceedings have been initiated, the debtor may not, without the consent of the administrator:
(i) take new loans (except for such loans which are within the ordinary course of business and the amount and terms of which are not unusual);
(ii) transfer the company or a part thereof or any of its assets which are required for its business purposes;
(iii) grant rights to the assets covered under (ii) above (except in the ordinary course of business);
(iv) dispose of inventories other than in the ordinary course of business and with customary terms;
(v) terminate agreements which are necessary for carrying on business;
(vi) grant security for other person's debt (except within the ordinary course of business and provided that the risks involved are not unusual);
(vii) take other actions, which are unusual or material; or
(viii) petition for bankruptcy.
During the restructuring proceedings, the creditors of the debtor company generally exercise their powers through the creditors committee. The creditors committee has a supervisory role and is not involved in the day-to-day management of the company.
During the restructuring proceedings, the administrator has the duty to:
(i) compile a list of the assets and restructuring debts of the company, as well as a report of any factors likely to affect the financial status of the company;
(ii) monitor the activities of the company;
(iii) to the extent necessary, conduct an audit of the activities of the company prior to the commencement of the restructuring proceedings;
227

(iv) initiate any proceedings for the revocation of transactions;
(v) prepare a proposal for the restructuring program; and
(vi) manage the restructuring proceedings pursuant to the Finnish Company Restructuring Act (Fi. Laki yrityksen san eerauksesta) (47/1993, as amended).
The administrator has a duty to perform his functions with regard to the interests of the creditors as a whole as well as with regard to the interests of the company. The administrator has a general duty of care and shall act fairly and honorably whilst in office.
All existing debts and claims against the company are suspended as of the commencement of the company restructuring. The suspension as a main rule prohibits the enforcement and placing of security, the repayment and enforcement of the restructuring debts (although debts arising after filing for company restructuring may be both repaid and enforced) and the seizure of assets. Restructuring debt, by definition, refers to all debt that has arisen prior to filing for restructuring, irrespective of when this debt falls due. The suspensions are in force until a restructuring program has been confirmed by the district court or the proceedings have been dismissed. Once the company restructuring program has been confirmed by the court, the company may pay the restructuring debts only in accordance with the program. All agreements entered into by the debtor remain in force and may not be terminated by a creditor, with certain exceptions. The administrator has the right to end certain agreement upon initiation of the restructuring proceedings.
Creditors with equal ranking have an equal standing in the arrangements of the restructuring debts within the restructuring program. Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Finnish Company Restructuring Act (Fi. Laki yrityksen saneerauksesta) (47/1993), the following measures may be taken with respect to unsecured debts in the restructuring program: (i) change the repayment schedule; (ii) order that debt payments be considered as payments against principal first, and as payments of interest and other credit costs only second; (iii) reduce the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of a debt; and (iv) reduce the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt. Consequently, the restructuring procedure could result in holders of the Notes receiving a right to recover considerably less than they would otherwise be entitled to recover under the Guarantee. It is to be noted, however, that the restructuring may not lead to a worse outcome for the creditors than the bankruptcy of the debtor.
Secured debt means restructuring debt where the creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security interest to property that belongs to or is in the possession of the debtor, insofar as the value of the security at the commencement of the proceedings would have been enough to cover the amount of the creditor's claim after the deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority, i.e. the amount of the creditor's claim exceeding the value of the security does not qualify as secured debt but, instead, will constitute unsecured debt and may, thus be subject to the measures described above. Regarding floating charges (Fi. yrityskiin n itys), only 50% of the value of the charged assets will be considered as secured debt.
The administrator determines the value of the security. The part of the debt for which the value of the security is insufficient is considered unsecured debt, and may thus be restructured as unsecured debt (e.g. haircut). Should the security be deemed worthless or the standing of the creditor sufficiently junior in relation to other creditors with the same security, the debt may be even considered unsecured in its entirety.
The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) change the repayment schedule; (ii) order that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and other credit costs second; or (iii) reduce the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of the debt. Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor's security interest, the security arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with other fully adequate security. Payments on a secured debt shall be determined so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be repaid
228

within a reasonable period, not to materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the consent of the creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, not to materially exceed one-half of the original credit period. As for reducing interest and other credit costs, a court will take into consideration the length of the remaining credit period, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the reduction in interest and credit costs.
Restructuring of both unsecured and secured debt may take place only to the extent deemed necessary for the success of the restructuring proceedings.
All restructuring measures are to be applied similarly to all similar bond-based debts (i.e. to such debtors that would, outside company restructuring proceedings, have an equal right to receive payment on their claim).
Bondholders are primarily each regarded as individual creditors to the debtor. The bondholders may, however, appoint a trustee to represent the bondholder collective in relation to the debtor and the administrator.
Bankruptcy
A debtor or its creditor may apply for bankruptcy from a bankruptcy court of competent jurisdiction when the debtor has failed to pay its debts and the inability to pay is not temporary. If the application is approved, an estate administrator (or several estate administrators) of the bankruptcy estate (Fi. p esanh oitaja) will be appointed by the court.
Bankruptcy covers all liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and use the proceeds received therefrom in payment of the creditors' claims. In order to achieve the objective of bankruptcy, the debtor's assets are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the estate administrator. The estate administrator must act for the common benefit of all creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the creditors in matters falling within the decision-making powers of the creditors. The creditors are represented through the creditor's meeting, and a creditors' committee may be appointed by the court.
As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement, a creditor must lodge a claim in bankruptcy in writing (a "letter of lodgement"), by delivering it to the estate administrator no later than the deadline set by the estate administrator. The obligation to lodge a claim binds even secured creditors. Failure to lodge a claim may lead to the expiration of the debt. A creditor who holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third party must, at the request of and within a time limit set by the estate administrator, provide the information on receivables and collateral that should be provided in a letter of lodgement. A creditor who holds a floating charge over the assets of the debtor as security of a claim against the debtor in bankruptcy or a debt owed by some other debtor shall lodge the claim as provided in the Finnish Bankruptcy Act. If a claim is denominated in a currency other than euro, a value in euro for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is determined using the exchange rate of the date of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings.
A creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor must, when giving notice of the set-off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a letter of lodgement.
Similar creditors have an equal right to payment from the funds of the bankruptcy estate in the proportion to the amount of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. The Act on the Ranking of Claims (Fi. Laki velko jien m aksunsaantijarjestyksesta) (1578/1992, as amended) determines the order in which debts are settled. The following creditors have precedence over unsecured creditors to receive disbursement from the estate: (i) secured creditors and holders of retention rights have priority to the proceeds relating to the relevant asset; (ii) creditors of the administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate, creditors with claims on the basis of contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the debtor) has entered into, any liabilities for which the bankruptcy estate is responsible by operation of law and creditors of a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceeding; and (iii) creditors
229

with claims that are secured by a floating charge will receive prior to other claims a disbursement of 50% of the net proceeds of the charged assets (after the claims of creditors with a better priority position have been satisfied). The rights of the above-mentioned preferential creditors may adversely affect the interests of holders of the Notes. Bankruptcy of any of the Guarantors organized in Finland could result in holders of the Notes recovering considerably less than they would have otherwise been entitled to recover under the applicable Note Guarantee. Further, it should be noted that debt incurred after the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, such as debt the estate has committed to, is prioritized and effectively reduce disbursable funds, and security with higher priority naturally affects the value of the security of the secured creditor with a lower priority.
The Finnish Act on the Ranking of Claims specifies which debt is ranked with the lowest priority. Such debt may be, for example, any interest accrued after the commencement of the bankruptcy, capital loans, or bonds issued with a lower priority in relation to other indebtedness by the debtor. In practice, there rarely remains disbursable funds to even partially cover claims with the lowest priority. The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding taxes and other fiscal charges. The assets of the bankruptcy estate are to be disposed of in the most advantageous manner so as to maximize the aggregate net proceeds. However, secured creditors that are secured pursuant to a fixed charge over movable or immovable property may exercise their right to enforce such collateral regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy estate may at its own discretion prohibit the sale for a maximum of two months. The bankruptcy estate may sell collateral belonging to the estate only if the creditor protected by the collateral consents to the same or if the court grants a specific permission.
Effect of bankruptcy on the bankruptcy debtor's contracts
As such, the debtor's contracts are not automatically terminated upon the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Contract clauses by which contracts are immediately terminated upon bankruptcy are generally considered null and void, and are thus unenforceable. Pursuant to the Finnish Bankruptcy Act, the bankruptcy estate is generally entitled to become party to any contracts of the debtor by notifying the creditor of this within a reasonable time. As noted above, debt arisen from such a contract entered into by the bankruptcy estate is prioritized over bankruptcy debts.
If a bankruptcy estate is willing to become party to a contract, the law entitles a creditor to request acceptable collateral from the bankruptcy estate to secure the performance of the contract. Should the bankruptcy estate be unwilling or unable to provide such collateral to the creditor, the creditor is entitled to terminate the contract.
Fraudulent conveyance law
Pursuant to the Finnish Act on the Recovery of Assets to Bankruptcy Estate (Fi. Laki takaisinsaannista konkurssipesaan) (758/1991, as amended) (the "Recovery Act"), certain acts performed by a debtor may be reversed if the rights of creditors have been prejudiced by those acts. According to the Finnish Company Restructuring Act and the Finnish Enforcement Code (Fi. U losottokaari) (705/2007, as amended), the grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act are also to be applied in restructuring and enforcement proceedings.
The bankruptcy estate administrator, the restructuring administrator and certain creditors may seek to recover assets of the debtor in connection with bankruptcy, restructuring or enforcement proceedings. The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action for recovery against the debtor's counterparty in a separate court proceeding or file an objection.
Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such date) may be recovered if: (i) the transaction, either by itself or
230

together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a creditor at the expense of other creditors, (b) places property beyond the reach of other creditors, or (c) increases debts to the detriment of the creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent or, in case of a transaction considered to be a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift, over-indebted; (iii) the counterparty of the transaction knew or should have known of the insolvency or over-indebtedness, or of the relevance of the transaction to the debtor's economic situation; and (iv) the counterparty knew or should have known the facts mentioned above in paragraph (i), on the basis of which the transaction is considered improper. The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery Act, which covers all transactions concluded between the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had qualified knowledge of all the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions between the debtor and certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor's sphere of interest (as defined in the Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction and such persons are assumed to have had knowledge of the issues described above in (i) and (ii).
Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of the good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through foreclosure; (ii) the payment of debts; and (iii) the granting of security. Payment received by a creditor through foreclosure effected by the relevant authority later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company reorganization or foreclosure is filed with the court (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor's sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered. Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or foreclosure is filed with the court or relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor's sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) unusual means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the amount of payment was considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be held as customary. Security given later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or foreclosure is filed with the court or the relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor's sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the granting of the credit; or (ii) the possession of the security had not been transferred, or any similar act perfecting the security had not been taken without unjustified delay after the granting of the credit.
When a transaction is recovered, the property that has been received from the debtor is returned to the bankruptcy estate or the debtor. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the compensation that has been paid for the property. If the funds have been placed beyond the reach of the creditors and the party that paid the funds knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor, there is no obligation to return the funds. If the property to be returned no longer exists, or is otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value of the property must be made. In addition, should the return of certain property cause inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay compensation equal to the value of the property instead of returning the property. The Recovery Act also sets forth an obligation to compensate for any decrease in value of the recovered property.
Accordingly, the validity of the Guarantees or any payment made thereunder may be challenged under the Recovery Act and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful. If the granting of a Guarantee or a payment thereunder is successfully challenged under the Recovery Act, then the granting of such a Guarantee could be nullified or the payment recovered. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of a Guarantee, and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to a Guarantee could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes, i.e. the holders of Note may be ordered to return any proceeds received pursuant to a Guarantee.
231

Limitations
The Guarantee granted by the Finnish Guarantor and any future guarantor incorporated in Finland will be limited by a general limitation that limits the scope of the guarantee to the extent the grant of such guarantee would be contrary to certain mandatory provisions of the Finnish Companies Act (Fi. O sakeyhtidlaki) (624/2006, as amended). Pursuant to such limitation, the beneficiaries of the Guarantee agree to enforce the guarantee against any Finnish guarantor only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in a breach of the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies Act by that Finnish guarantor. Certain significant limitations to a company's ability to grant guarantees are included in sections 1 and 10 of chapter 13 of the Finnish Companies Act regulating the unlawful distribution of funds and prohibited financial assistance. Pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act, a Finnish limited liability company, such as the Finnish Guarantor, is prohibited from providing loans, guarantees, assets or security for the purpose of a third party acquiring shares in such company or its parent companies. Further, the Finnish Companies Act provides that no guarantee or security may be granted (or any other transaction entered into) by a Finnish limited liability company without commercial grounds, i.e., unless doing so is in the company's own commercial interest. In assessing the existence and scope of corporate benefit to the company, all relevant benefits and risks to the company are to be taken into account. In the context of the Guarantee, among other things, other guarantees and security granted or to be granted by the Finnish Guarantor for the other financing arrangements of the Group in connection with, in te r alia, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Pension Insurance Line are to be taken into consideration. The actual scope of the Guarantee by the Finnish Guarantor may therefore be substantially less than the aggregate amount of liabilities expressed to be guaranteed and, in fact, it is possible that owing to the application of mandatory Finnish law relating to unlawful profit distribution, as applied to the Guarantee, no liabilities or obligations will under Finnish law, be held to be effectively guaranteed.
Establishing security interest
General
In order to create a valid security interest under Finnish law, the following criteria must generally be met: (a) there must be an underlying debtor-creditor relationship in respect of the obligations which the security purports to secure; (b) the pledgor must grant the security interest, typically in the form of a pledge agreement; and (c) an act perfecting the security interest must take place. The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type.
Under Finnish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest (pledge) by the secured party and the grantor (pledgor), for any security (pledge) to be validly created, the grantor (pledgor) must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest (pledge). Any security interest (pledge) purported to be created under Finnish law over assets which the grantor (pledgor) may remain in possession of, retain exclusive or shared control over, entitled to operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from until the occurrence of an enforcement event would therefore not be effective until an enforcement event has occurred and the security interest (pledge) has been perfected. Such unperfected security interest (pledge) is vulnerable of being set aside in any insolvency proceedings affecting the grantor (pledgor) and may, potentially, be declared void.
Shares
In the case of shares, the perfection of the pledge is achieved in respect of a private limited liability company by (i) transferring the share certificate(s) (if issued) to the possession of the secured party and/or (ii) notifying the company of the pledge and by the company recording the pledge in its register of shares.
Bank accounts and claims in general
Pledges can also be granted and perfected in receivables and other claims (including bank accounts). Security over receivables and claims is perfected by way of notification to the debtor
232

of the underlying claim. There is no requirement as to the form for such notification. However, in order to obtain the intended result, the pledgor or the secured party should state that the claim has been pledged to the secured party and the notice must also effectively prohibit the underlying debtor from paying the pledgor. For bank accounts this means that the accountholder cannot be allowed to dispose of the account, including withdrawing funds from the account. For claims/receivables, such as dividends, this means that the underlying debtor must be instructed to make payments to the pledgee (instead of the pledgor). The bank accounts and any claims/ receivables pledged as Collateral to secure the Notes will not be perfected on the Issue Date, and will not be perfected until an enforcement event.
Floating charges and real estate mortgages
In the case of Finnish floating charge promissory notes and real estate mortgage notes, the perfection of the pledge is achieved by transferring the duly issued and registered Finnish floating charge promissory notes and real estate mortgage certificates the possession of the secured party.
Patents and trademarks
In the case of patents and trademarks, the perfection of the pledge over Finnish patents and trademarks is achieved by registering the pledge with the Finnish Patent and Registration Office (Fi: P a te n tti-ja rekisterihallitus) or, in case of Community Trademarks, registering the pledge with the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market ("OHIM"), or in case of European patents, registering the pledge with the European Patent Office.
Security is granted under security agreements governed by Finnish law (the ''Finnish Security Agreements") by (a) Ovako Finland Oy Ab as a Finnish Guarantor over, inter alia, (i) a share pledge over the shares of Ovako Imatra Oy Ab and (ii) floating charge promissory note(s) and (b) Ovako Imatra Oy Ab as a Finnish Guarantor over, inter alia,(i) bank accounts and deposits situated in Finland, (ii) floating charge promissory note(s), (iii) real estate mortgage certificates and (iv) certain registered intellectual property rights (trademarks and patents)and (c) Triako Finco AB over the shares of Ovako Finland Oy Ab. With regard to pledges over bank accounts, the relevant Finnish Guarantor remains entitled to exercise control over the pledged bank accounts (including withdrawing monies) until the bank account pledge may be enforced pursuant to the relevant Finnish Security Agreement and the security agent has instructed the account holding bank to block the relevant Finnish Guarantor's access to the bank account. Therefore, the bank account pledge created under the Finnish Security Agreement has not been duly perfected under Finnish law and is thus vulnerable to being set aside or being declared void. In relation to share pledges under the Finnish Security Agreements and the pledges over dividends thereunder, the relevant companies whose shares have been pledged may make payments of the dividends to the relevant pledgor until the pledge may be enforced pursuant to the Finnish Security Agreement and the security agent has instructed the relevant companies whose shares have been pledged to make all payments to the security agent. Therefore, the pledge of dividends created under the Finnish Security Agreements has not been duly perfected under Finnish law and is thus vulnerable to being set aside or being declared void.
Limitations on the recovery of the creditors with claims that are secured by a floating charge have been discussed above under " -- C om pany R estru ctu rin g " and "--B a n kru p tcy".
Enforcement of security
General
Enforcement can take place either outside of bankruptcy proceedings or during bankruptcy proceedings. Instead, in company restructuring proceedings, a moratorium applies and enforcement is generally not possible. The terms of the relevant security agreement regulate the enforcement, however, subject to constraints set by mandatory Finnish law.
233

Complex, case specific legal issues often apply to enforcement. These aspects are discussed below on a general level only.
Enforcement outside of bankruptcy proceedings
Depending on the type of security arrangement / asset under security, the secured creditor may, generally, enforce the security independently (such as security over shares, bank accounts and receivables) or through public enforcement authorities (such as floating charges and real estate mortgages).
When enforcing a security, the secured creditor has a duty to take into account, in an appropriate way in the circumstances, the interests of the pledgor and those of other potential interested parties, such as any second lien pledgees or floating charge holders. In practice, this means, in te r alia, that the secured creditor may not sell the secured assets for a price lower than fair market value in the then current circumstances. This duty of care is generally deemed to apply irrespective of the terms of the security agreement.
When the secured creditor enforces security outside of bankruptcy proceedings and to the extent that the net proceeds exceed the creditor's secured claim, the secured creditor must hold the excess proceeds for the account of any second lien pledgees, floating charge holders and/or the pledgor, as appropriate.
Enforcement during bankruptcy proceedings
In a bankruptcy scenario where the secured creditor enforces the security independent from the concurrent bankruptcy proceedings (which is possible in respect of e.g. security over shares, bank accounts, receivables and IPR, but not for floating charges), the secured creditor will use the enforcement proceeds to satisfy its secured claim. The secured creditor shall then render to the bankruptcy liquidator an account of the proceeds of the enforcement and transfer to the bankruptcy liquidator the net proceeds from the enforcement that exceed the creditor's secured claim.
After bankruptcy proceedings have been initiated, there are four options available for the enforcement of a real estate mortgage:
(i) Private (or public) sale by the liquidator with the consent of the mortgagee(s).
(ii) If the mortgagee(s) does not give its consent for the liquidator to effect a private (or public) sale, the liquidator may seek the court's approval for the sale.
(iii) Despite the bankruptcy proceedings, the mortgagee can proceed to seek a court order to allow the mortgagee to independently enforce the mortgage by arranging the sale of the underlying real property through public enforcement authorities.
(iv) After three years have passed since the commencement of the bankruptcy, public sale by the liquidator without the consent of the mortgagee(s) or a court order.
In a bankruptcy scenario where the bankruptcy liquidator enforces the security, the bankruptcy liquidator will distribute the enforcement proceeds to the secured creditor up to the amount of the creditor's secured claim, whereas any excess proceeds will form a part of the assets of the estate (to be distributed to creditors).
Irrespective of whether the enforcement in bankruptcy was carried out by the secured creditor independently or by the bankruptcy liquidator, should the enforcement proceeds not suffice to satisfy the creditor's secured claim, the outstanding balance of the secured creditor's claim will constitute an ordinary unsecured claim towards the bankruptcy estate and will rank p ro rata with the claims of other unsecured creditors.
Enforcement during company restructuring proceedings
If company restructuring proceedings have been initiated against the pledgor, the pledgee can no longer enforce the pledge independently (nor accelerate the underlying loans against the
234

pledgor) and any enforcement procedures already initiated (but not completed) will be discontinued. The prohibition to enforce the pledge is in force until the court has passed a decision to either accept or reject the restructuring program proposed by the administrator. This moratorium does not, however, apply where the security in question qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Finnish Act on Financial Collateral (888/2010, as amended).
If the restructuring program is accepted by the court, the enforcement of pledges is likely to be covered by the restructuring program. Should the proposed program be rejected, the most likely outcome is the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings.
Security granted in favor o f an agent
Under Finnish law security should be granted in favor of the relevant pledgees/secured parties and not in favor of an agent alone. The pledgees/secured parties may, however, be represented by an agent who can enter into the relevant security agreement for and on behalf of the pledgees/secured parties based on a power of attorney or a mandate of agency. It is generally considered under Finnish law that an irrevocable authorization and an irrevocable appointment of agent may nevertheless be revoked at any time by the principal.
Liquidation due to capital deficiency
The Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act (Fi. O sakeyhtiolaki) (624/2006, as amended) (the "Finnish Companies Act") requires a company to give notification to the Finnish Patent and Registration Office should its equity become negative, but does not include any provisions mandating the board of directors of a company to file for bankruptcy or place the company into liquidation due to the financial standing of the company. However, the law includes provisions concerning the managements' liability for damages deliberately or negligently caused to the company, or due to violation of the duty of care. A director may therefore be de facto required to file the company for bankruptcy or apply for liquidation, which may adversely affect the value of any securities or guarantees given by the company.
Germany
Insolvency. In the event of insolvency of a Subsidiary Guarantor or a provider of Collateral organized under the laws of Germany and/or having its centre of main interests in Germany (the "German Providers") any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. See also " --Eu ropean U n io n ".
The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (De. In so lvenzo rd n u n g ), may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, in te r alia, in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post petition interest as well as security interests and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.
The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.
Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (De. U berschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of illiquidity (De. Z a h lu n g su n fa h ig keit), meaning that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due. A debtor is considered over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets unless, given the circumstances, it is predominantly likely (De. u b e rw ieg e n d w ahrscheinlich) than not that the debtor's business can survive as a going concern. If a limited liability company (De. G esellsch a ft m it b esch ra n k ter H a ftu n g ), a stock corporation (De. A k tie n g e se llsch a ft--A G ), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (De. Societas Europaea--SE), any other limited liability company or any company not having an individual as
235

personally liable shareholder finds itself in a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management board or managing directors of such company are obliged to file for insolvency without delay but not later than three weeks after such illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness was established. In addition, only the debtor can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of impending illiquidity (De. d ro h en d e Z a h lu n g su n fa h ig keit), if there is the imminent risk for the company of being unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due, whereas impending illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings.
The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (De. In so lve n ze ro ffn u n g sverfa h ren ). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor's assets during these preliminary proceedings as far as these protective measures are reasonable to protect the debtor's assets and/or to ensure the continuation of the debtor's business.
As part of such protective measures the court may appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (De. v o rla u fig e r In so lven zverw a lter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor's property and to assess whether the debtor's net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator.
During preliminary proceedings a "preliminary creditors' committee" (De. vorlaufiger Glaubigerausschuss) usually needs to be set up if the debtor satisfies two of the following three requirements: a balance sheet total in excess of EUR4,840,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted), revenue of at least EUR9,680,000 in the twelve months prior to the last balance sheet date and/or fifty or more employees. Also in a case where less than two of the aforementioned requirements are satisfied a preliminary creditors' committee may be set up under certain circumstances upon the request of the debtor, the preliminary insolvency administrator or a creditor. The preliminary creditors' committee will be able to participate in certain important insolvency court decisions. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator or an insolvency administrator (De. vorlaufige Insolvenzverw alter and Insolvenzverw alter), orders for "debtor in possession" proceedings (De. A n o rdn u n g d e r Eigenverw altung), and appointments of preliminary trustees (De. Sachwalter).
The court orders the opening (De. Ero ffn u n g sb esch lu ss) of main insolvency proceedings (De. e ro ffn e te s In so lvenzverfa h ren ) if certain requirements are met, in particular if (i) the debtor is in a situation of impending illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the debtor) or illiquidity and/or over-indebted and (ii) there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open main insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (De. A b w e isu n g m angels M asse).
Upon the opening of main insolvency proceedings, the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator (De. Insolvenzverw a lter) who is appointed by the insolvency court unless debtor-in-possession (De. E ig en verw a ltu n g ) is ordered. The creditors are only entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors' assembly (De. erste G laubigerversam m lung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e. sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. In addition, the insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor's operations and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (De. M asseschulden) will be
236

preferred to any insolvency claims of unsecured creditors (this also includes such portion of an in rem secured creditor's claim which exceeds the amount obtained through a disposal of the relevant collateral).
All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (De. A u sso n d eru n g srech t)), wishing to assert claims against the debtor in person need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Act. Any judicial enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). If, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor acquires through execution (i.e., attachment) a security interest in part of the debtor's property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon opening of the insolvency proceedings. Accordingly, unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Secured creditors are not entitled to enforce their security interests after an insolvency petition has been filed to the extent the Insolvency Code authorizes the insolvency administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral (though, between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence, such stay on enforcement requires a court order) but have only certain preferential rights (De. A b so n d eru n g srech te ) in the insolvency proceedings. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured creditor remains entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security. However, even though the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the secured creditor retains a right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds. As a consequence, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (De. Feststellu n g sko sten ) and (ii) realising the secured assets (De. V erw ertu n g sko sten ), which, in aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims.
If a Subsidiary Guarantor grants security over its assets to other creditors than holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of such other creditors' secured claims (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant collateral). With any remaining amounts and any proceeds arising from the realization of the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor, the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (De. M asseglaubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims--De. In so lve n zfo rd e ru n g e n ), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate (De. Insolvenzm asse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full.
The remaining amounts (the "excess proceeds") resulting from the disposal of collateral provided to such other creditors or any unencumbered assets may not be sufficient to satisfy the claims of the holders of the Notes against a German Subsidiary Guarantor under its Guarantee. In addition, it may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are distributed to unsecured creditors.
A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (De. Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance
237

with specific majority rules (with secured creditors being grouped in a separate class). Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-to-equity-swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity swap if it does not consent to such debt-to-equity swap.
If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness it may also file for preliminary "debtor in possession" proceedings (De. Sch u tzsch irm verfah ren). In such a case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months if an independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor's business is not obviously futile (De. o ffen sich tlich aussichtslos) and that the debtor is not already illiquid. During such period, the debtor shall, together with its creditors and a preliminary trustee (De. v o rla u fig e r Sachw alter), prepare an insolvency plan which ideally will be implemented in formal "debtor in possession" proceedings (De. Eig en verw a ltu n g ) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.
Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity has, from an insolvency law point of view, to be dealt with separately on an entity by entity basis (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather the claims of and vis-a-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. In 2013, the German Federal Ministry of Justice (De. Bundesjustizministerium) has released a draft Bill to Facilitate the Handling of Group Insolvencies (De. E n tw u rf ein es G esetzes z u r E rle ich te ru n g d e r B ew a ltig u n g von K o n zern in so lven zen ). While the draft Bill does not propose to abolish the principle of separate insolvency proceedings in relation to each group entity, it stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Act in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (1) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceedings; (2) the appointment of an identical person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (3) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors' committees; and (4) certain parties may apply for ''coordination proceedings" (De. K o o rd in a tio n sverfa h ren ) and the appointment of a ''coordination insolvency administrator" (De. K o o rd in a tio n sverw a lter) with the ability to propose a ''coordination plan'' (De. K oord in a tio n sp la n ). It is currently unclear if and when, and whether in its current or modified form, this Bill might be adopted by parliament.
Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors.
Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.
Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or ''escape clauses'' entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (De. in so lve n zb e zo g e n e K u n d ig u n g sre ch te o d e r Losungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.
Lim itation on en fo rcem en t. The German Guarantor is incorporated in the form of a GmbH (Limited Liability Company, De. G esellsch aft m it b esch ra n k ter H aftun g). Consequently, the
238

granting of collateral (including a guarantee) by the German Guarantor is subject to certain provisions of the G m bH-G esetz (Limited Liability Company Act), including rules on capital maintenance.
As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbH-Gesetz ("Sections 30 and 31") prohibit a GmbH disbursing its assets to its shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH's net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (De. Stam m kapital). The granting of guarantees, share pledges and other security by a GmbH in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are generally considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 (which may even lead to the directors of such company becoming personally liable vis-a vis the company), it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called "limitation language" in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or limited liability partnership with a GmbH as its sole general partner (a GmbH &Co. KG) incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security interests agree, subject to certain exemptions, to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the GmbH's (or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner's) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the security documents relating to Guarantees or Collateral provided by a German GmbH will contain such limitation language and the relevant Guarantee and Collateral will be limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee by the German Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.
German capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court decisions. Future court rulings may further limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make payments on the Guarantees, of the secured parties to enforce the Collateral or of the beneficiaries of the Guarantees to enforce the Guarantees.
H ardening p e rio d s a n d fra u d u le n t tran sfer. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a German collateral provider, which would most likely be based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the guarantee or security interest provided by that entity could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator (De. In so lvenzverw a lter) under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code (De. Insolvenzord n u n g ).
Under these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge (De. an fech ten ) acts (De. R ech tsh an dlun gen ) and legal transactions (De. R ech tsgeschafte) that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as granting them any security interest (including guarantees). The administrator's right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event such a transaction is successfully avoided, the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received or to waive the guarantee or the benefit of the security interest.
In particular, a transaction (which term includes the provision of security (including guarantees) and the repayment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be avoided according to the German Insolvency Act, inter alia, in the following cases:
 Any legal act (De. Rechtshandlung) granting a creditor or enabling a creditor to obtain, a security (including a guarantee) or satisfaction for a debt (De. B efried ig u n g) can be avoided if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was
239

illiquid (De. za h lu n g su n fa hig , i.e., unable to pay its debt when due) and the creditor had knowledge thereof, or (ii) after a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings has been filed and the creditor had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being illiquid;
 Any legal act (De. Rechtshandlung) granting a creditor or enabling a creditor to obtain, a security (including a guarantee) or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor had no right, no right at the respective time or no right as to the respective manner, can be avoided if the transaction was effected in the month prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such filing; if the transaction was effected in the second or third month prior to the filing, it can be avoided if at the time of the transaction (i) the debtor was illiquid, or (ii) the creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental to the creditors of the debtor;
 Any legal act (De. Rechtshandlung) transaction effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors of the debtor or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against the debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, can be avoided if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid and the other party to the transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the debtor and the other party to the transaction had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being illiquid;
 Any legal transaction (De. R echtsgeschaft) whereby a debtor grants a guarantee or security interest for a third party debt might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (De. u n en tgeltlich ); a gratuitous transaction can be avoided if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the debtor;
 Any legal act (De. R ech tsh an dlu n g) entered into by the grantor of the guarantee or security interest in the last ten years prior to the filing of a petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter with the intent to prejudice its creditors can be avoided if the beneficiary of the transaction had knowledge of such intent at the time of the transaction;
 Any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor's intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term 'affiliated party' includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor's share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;
 Any legal act (De. Rechtshandlung) transaction with respect to the claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan (De. G esellsch afterdarleh en) or an equivalent claim can be avoided (i) in the event it provided security, if the transaction was effected in the last ten years prior to the filing of a petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter or (ii) in the event it resulted in satisfaction, if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; and
 Any legal act (De. R echtsgeschaft) whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party can be avoided if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and if a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (De. G arant o r Burge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).
240

In this context, "knowledge" is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., a company subject to the German insolvency laws) was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor's intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor's impending illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor's creditors.
If any of the Guarantees or Collateral by any of the German Providers was avoided or held unenforceable for any reason, a holder of the Notes would cease to have any claim or benefit in respect thereof. Any amounts received from a transaction that had been avoided would have to be repaid to the insolvent estate.
Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (De. V ollstrecku n gstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to avoid certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Act on Avoidance (De. A n fe ch tu n g sg e se tz). The prerequisites differ to a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.
In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor's (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor's (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (De. B u n d esg erich tsh o f) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of b o n o s m ores (De. Sitte n w id rig k e it). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (De. Zusam m enbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.
Parallel d eb t. Under German law, certain "accessory" security interests such as pledges (De. Pfan drechte) require that the pledgee and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The holders of the Notes, will not be party to the security documents relating to the Collateral. In order for the holders of the Notes to benefit from Collateral under "accessory" security documents, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a "parallel debt". Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes and the Guarantees. The pledges governed by German law will directly secure the parallel debt. The parallel debt procedure has not been tested in court under German law, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German law. Further, if the parallel debt is novated from the Security Agent to a new security agent or another third party, any German law governed accessory security interests such as pledges (De. Pfan drechte) would extinguish and would therefore need to be re-created with the consequence that hardening periods would start again from the date of re-creation of security.
241

Book-entry, delivery and form
General
Certain defined terms used but not defined in this section have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture as described in "D escrip tion o f N o tes". Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by one global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "Rule 144A Global Note"). Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in offshore transactions (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S will initially be represented by one global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "Regulation S Global Note" and, together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the "Global Notes"). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with, or on behalf of, a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream.
Ownership of beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (the "Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests") and ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the "Regulation S BookEntry Interests" and, together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the "Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants and must be in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set out in the Indenture and in any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or of any other jurisdiction, as described under "Im p o rta n t in fo rm a tio n ". Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers' securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, owners of Book-Entry Interests will not be entitled to receive definitive Notes in certificated form ("Definitive Registered Notes").
Instead, Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, the respective book-entry registration and transfer systems maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of BookEntry Interests will not be considered the owners or "holders" of Notes for any purpose.
So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its respective nominee), as applicable, will be considered the sole holder of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. Accordingly, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.
The Notes will be issued in denominations of EUR100,000 and in integral multiples of EUR1,000 in excess thereof.
None of us, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Trustee or any other of our other respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.
Definitive Registered Notes
Under the terms of the Indenture, to the extent permitted by Euroclear and Clearstream, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes only:
(1) if either Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days; or
242

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or Clearstream following an "Event of Default" under and as defined in the Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.
Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described in the immediately preceding clause, their current procedure is to request that we issue, or cause to be issued, Definitive Registered Notes.
In any such event described in clauses (1) or (2), we will instruct the Registrar to issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or us, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and certain certification requirements and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of the Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.
To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.
The Registrar will send a copy of the register to the Issuer on the Issue Date and after any change to the register of holders of the Notes made by the Registrar, with such copy to be held by the Issuer and at its registered office.
We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.
So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Issuer will publish a notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in a newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Lu xem b u rg er W ort). Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at the office of the paying agent so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Redemption of the Global Notes
In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream (or its respective nominee), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The common depositary will surrender such Global Note to the Registrar for cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the common depositary will request the Registrar or the Trustee to mark down, endorse and return the applicable Global Note to reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such partial redemption. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at anytime, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their participants' accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate (including the pool factor); provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than EUR100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.
Payments on Global Notes
We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the relevant Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent in euro
243

for onward payment to common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common depositary will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts free and clear of, without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under "D escrip tio n o f N otes--A d d itio n a l a m o u n ts". If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under "D escrip tion o f N otes--A d d itio n a l am o unts" we will pay such Additional Amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts received by any holder of the relevant Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding are not less than the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.
Under the terms of the Indenture, we, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and the Paying Agent will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:
 any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, or indirect participant or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;
 any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or
 the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream and any nominee thereof, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.
Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such participants.
Currency of payment for the Global Notes
The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will be paid to holders of Book-Entry Interests in such Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream in euro.
Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of us, the Trustee or the Initial Purchasers or any of our or their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment.
Action by owners of Book-Entry Interests
Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under
244

the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of such Notes, reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certifiable form and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.
Transfers
Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and Clearstream's rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.
The Global Notes will each bear a legend to the effect set forth under "Plan o f d istrib u tio n -- Tran sfer re strictio n s". Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under "Plan o f d istrib u tio n -- Transfer re strictio n s".
Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A under the Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act) and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the U.S. or any other jurisdiction. Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, any sale or transfer of interests to U.S. persons will not be permitted unless the resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A.
Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under "Plan o f d istrib u tio n -- Tra n sfer re strictio n s" and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.
In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note. Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in "N otice to in vesto rs" Book-Entry Interests may be transferred and exchanged as described under
"D escription o f Notes-- Transfer and exchange."
Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as described under "D escrip tio n o f N otes-- Tra n sfer an d exch a n g e" and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See "Plan o f d istrib u tio n -- Tran sfer re strictio n s".
Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream
All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. We have provided the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at anytime. Neither we, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor the common depositary are responsible for those operations or procedures.
We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.
Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.
Global clearance and settlement under the book-entry system
The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective system's rules and operating procedures.
Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at anytime. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.
Initial settlement
Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.
We expect that the delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about May 23, 2014, which will be the fifth business day following the date of pricing of the Notes
246

(such settlement cycle being herein referred to as "T+5"). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes on the date of pricing or any of the next succeeding business days will be required to, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle T+5, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade Notes on the day of pricing or the next succeeding business day should consult their advisors.
Secondary market trading
The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser's and the seller's accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.
Special timing considerations
You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for business.
In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or in Brussels if Euroclear is used.
Clearing information
The Notes have been accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers and common codes for the Notes are set forth under "L istin g a n d G en eral In fo rm a tio n ".
Trustees' powers
In considering the interests of the holders of Notes, while title to the Notes is registered in the name of a nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Trustee may have regard to, and rely on, any information provided to it by those clearing systems as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its accountholders with entitlements to Notes and may consider such interests as if such accountholders were the holders of the Notes.
Enforcement
For the purposes of enforcement of the provisions of the Indenture against the Trustee, the persons named in a certificate of the holder of the Notes in respect of which a Global Note is issued shall be recognized as the beneficiaries of the trusts set out in the Indenture to the extent of the principal amounts of their interests in the Notes set out in the certificate of the holder, as if they were themselves the holders of Notes in such principal amounts.
247

Plan of distribution

Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the purchase agreement among us, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers dated the date hereof (the "Purchase Agreement"), we have agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite their names below:

Initial Purchaser
J.P. Morgan Securities plc .......................................................................... Nordea Bank Danmark A/S ........................................................................ Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch...........................................................
Total ............................................................................................................

Principal Amount of Notes
EUR150,000,000 EUR 90,000,000 EUR 60,000,000
EUR300,000,000*

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all of the Notes being sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement if any of them are purchased.
The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and any other selling terms without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates and agents. Any Initial Purchaser that is not a broker-dealer registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will effect offers to sell and sales of the Notes into the United States or to nationals or residents of the United States only through one or more registered broker-dealers in compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations. One or more of the Initial Purchasers may sell the Notes through affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities in jurisdictions in which they are otherwise not licensed or authorized to make direct sales of the Notes. As Nordea Bank Danmark A/S is not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a U.S. registered broker-dealer, it will effect offers and sales of the Notes solely outside of the United States.
The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions precedent, the delivery of officer's certificates, certain legal opinions and the approval of certain matters by their counsel.
In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that:
 We will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of our debt securities having a tenor of more than one year (other than the Notes) for a period through and including the date that is 90 days after the date of this offering memorandum without the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities plc.
 The Issuer and Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers and their controlling persons and certain other persons against certain liabilities in connection with the Offering, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.
The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or qualified for sale under the securities laws of any U.S. state or any jurisdiction outside the United States. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they propose to resell the Notes
 to QIBs in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A; and
 outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.
In connection with sales outside the United States, each Initial Purchaser has acknowledged and agreed that it will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S.

248

persons (other than "distributors" within the meaning of Regulation S) (a) as part of its distribution at any time or (b) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the Offering or the date the Notes were originally issued. Each Initial Purchaser will send to each dealer to whom its sells the Notes in reliance on Regulation S during the 40-day distribution compliance period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. In addition, until the expiration of the 40-day distribution compliance period, an offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the Securities Act.
You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities.
Each purchaser of the Notes, by its purchase of the Notes, will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements as set forth under "Notice to investors".
Transfer restrictions
The Notes and Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or qualified for sale under the securities laws of any U.S. state or any jurisdiction outside the United States and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Accordingly, the Notes will be subject to significant restrictions on resale and transfer as described under "N otice to in vesto rs". Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers who are registered as such under the Exchange Act. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of this Offering and (ii) the issue date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.
In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area that has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a "Relevant Member State"), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the "Relevant Implementation Date"), the offer is not being made and will not be made to the public of any Notes which are the subject of the Offering contemplated by this offering memorandum in that Relevant Member State, other than:
 to legal entities which are authorized or regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorized or regulated, whose corporate purpose is solely to invest in securities;
 to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive;
 to fewer than 100 (or 150, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the relevant provision of the 2010 PD Amending Directive) natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive) subject to obtaining the prior consent of the Issuer; or
 in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive; provided that no such offer of the Notes shall require us or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.
For the purposes of this provision, the expression an "offer of Notes to the public" in relation to the Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any
249

means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State and the expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive 2003/71/EC, as amended, and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State (and amendments thereto, including the 2010 PD Amending Directive, to the extent that such directive has been implemented in the Relevant Member State), and the expression "2010 PD Amending Directive" means Directive 2010/73/EU.
In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that:
 it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not apply to us or the Guarantors; and
 it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.
No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See "N o tice to In ve sto rs".
The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.
Liquidity
The Notes are a new issue and new class of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under "--Tran sfer re strictio n s" and "N o tice to In ve sto rs." We have applied, through our Luxembourg Listing Agent, to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and have the Notes admitted to trading on the Euro MTF thereof; however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or such listing will be maintained.
The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. Any such market-making activity will be, among others, subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the Notes and may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Notes, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. See "R isk factors-- Risks relating to an in vestm en t in th e N otes a n d the
250

Guarantees-- There is no established trading m arket fo r the Notes. I f a m arket fo r the N otes does n o t develop, yo u r ability to sell the Notes may be lim ited".
Stabilization
In connection with this Offering, the Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on behalf of the Stabilizing Manager) may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, over-allot Notes or effect transactions with a view to stabilizing or maintaining the market price of the Notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. Such transaction may include over-allotment, stabilizing bids, syndicate covering transactions or the imposition of penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. We nor the Initial Purchasers make no representation that the Stabilizing Manager will undertake any such stabilization action nor with respect to the direction or magnitude of any stabilization action taken. Such stabilization action, if commenced, may begin on or after the date of adequate public disclosure of the final terms of the offer of Notes and may be ended at any time, but must end no later than the earlier of 30 calendar days after the date on which the Issuer received the proceeds of the issue and 60 calendar days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be affected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.
Settlement
It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on the cover of this offering memorandum, which will be the fifth business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act) following the date hereof (such settlement cycle being referred to as "T+5"). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering or the next succeeding business day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+5, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.
Other activities and relationships
Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment banking, commercial banking and other financial advisory and commercial dealings with us and our associates. They have received (or will receive) customary fees and commissions for these transactions. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are mandated lead arrangers of and will be lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. We expect that Nordea Bank AB (publ), an affiliate of Nordea Danmark A/S, will act as mandated lead arranger and facility agent under our new Revolving Credit Facility.
In addition, per December 31, 2013, Nordea Bank AB (publ) owned profit participating debentures issued by Triako Holdco AB in the amount of EUR9,813,880 (representing 87.25% of the total outstanding amount thereof). Triako Holdco AB is the direct shareholder of the Parent Company and not a part of the restricted group of companies.
We intend to use part of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to repay in full our obligations under our Senior Credit Facilities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are
251

lenders under our existing Senior Credit Facilities including Nordea Bank AB (publ), which also acts as mandated lead arranger, facility agent and security agent under our Senior Facilities Agreement and will therefore receive part of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. In addition, Nordea Bank AB (publ) will act as mandated lead arranger, agent and lender under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and agent and issuing bank under the Original Pension Insurance Line.
252

Notice to investors
Because of the following restrictions, purchasers are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, sale, resale, pledge or other transfer of the Notes. The Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Notes and the Guarantees are being offered and sold only (i) to "qualified institutional buyers" (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) ("QIBs") in compliance with Rule 144A and (ii) to persons other than U.S. persons (as defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act) ("Foreign Purchasers") in offshore transactions (as defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act) in compliance with Regulation S.
In addition, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the Offering and the closing date of this Offering an offer or sale of the Notes (including the Guarantees) within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A.
Each purchaser of the Notes hereunder (other than each of the Initial Purchasers) will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows (terms used in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A and Regulation S are used herein as defined therein):
(1) it is not an "affiliate" (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Issuer or acting on behalf of the Issuer and it is either:
(i) a QIB and is aware that any sale of the Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A and the acquisition of the Notes will be for its own account or for the account of another QIB; or
(ii) a Foreign Purchaser purchasing the Notes outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.
(2) it is purchasing the Notes (including the Guarantees) for its own account or an account with respect to which it exercises sole investment discretion: in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any state securities laws and it and any such account (i) is a QIB, and is aware that the sale to it is being made in reliance on Rule 144A or (ii) is a Foreign Purchaser and is aware that the sale is being made in accordance with Regulation S;
(3) it acknowledges that the Notes (including the Guarantees) have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or with any securities regulatory authority of any jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold except as set forth below;
(4) it acknowledges that neither the Group nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing the Group or the Initial Purchasers, has made any representation to it with respect to the Offering or sale of any Notes, other than the information contained in this offering memorandum, which offering memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this offering memorandum. It also acknowledges that it has had access to such financial and other information concerning the Group and the Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes;
(5) it understands and agrees that if in the future it decides to resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any Notes (including the Guarantees) or any beneficial interests in any Notes (including the Guarantees) prior to the date which is one year (or such shorter period of time as permitted by Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any successor provision thereunder)
253

after the later of the date of original issue and the last date on which the Issuer or any affiliate of the Issuer was the owner of the Notes (or any predecessor thereto), it will do so only (A) (i) to the Issuer, the Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof, (ii) to a person whom the seller, and any person acting on its behalf, reasonably believes is a QIB that is purchasing for its own account or for the account of a QIB or QIBs, in a transaction complying with Rule 144A, (iii) in an offshore transaction in compliance with Regulation S or (iv) pursuant to any other available exemption from registration under the Securities Act, or (B) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, and in each of such cases in accordance with any applicable securities law of any state of the United States;
(6) it agrees to, and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any purchaser of the Notes from it of the resale restrictions referred to in clause (3) above, if then applicable;
(7) if it is a person other than a Foreign Purchaser, it understands and agrees that the Notes initially offered to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A will be represented by a Rule 144A Global Note, and that before any interest in the Rule 144A Global Note may be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred to a person who is not a QIB, the transferee will be required to provide the Trustee with a written certification (the form of which certification can be obtained from the Trustee as to compliance with the transfer restriction referred to above);
(8) if it is a Foreign Purchaser in a sale that occurs outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S, it acknowledges that until the expiration of the "distribution compliance period" (as defined below), it shall not make any offer or sale of the Notes to a U.S. person or for the account or benefit of a U.S. person within the meaning of Rule 902 under the Securities Act. The "distribution compliance period" means the 40 day period following the issue date for the Notes;
(9) it understands that the Notes will bear a legend to the following effect:
THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE. BY ITS ACQUISITION HEREOF, THE HOLDER FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ISSUER AND THE GUARANTORS AND ANY OF THEIR SUCCESSORS IN INTEREST (1) REPRESENTS THAT (A) IT IS A "QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER" (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT) OR (B) IT IS NOT A U.S. PERSON AND IS ACQUIRING THIS NOTE IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION, (2) AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT PRIOR TO THE DATE WHICH IS [IN THE CASE OF RULE 144A NOTES: ONE YEAR] [IN THE CASE OF REGULATION S NOTES: 40 DAYS] (OR SUCH SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME AS PERMITTED BY [RULE 144] [REGULATION S] UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY SUCCESSOR PROVISION THEREUNDER) AFTER THE LATER OF THE DATE OF ORIGINAL ISSUE AND THE LAST DATE ON WHICH THE ISSUER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE ISSUER WAS THE OWNER OF THE NOTES (OR ANY PREDECESSOR THERETO) (THE "RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE") RESELL, PLEDGE OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS NOTE OR A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN THIS NOTE EXCEPT (A) TO THE ISSUER, THE GUARANTORS OR ANY SUBSIDIARY THEREOF, (B) TO A PERSON THAT THE SELLER, AND ANY PERSON ACTING ON ITS BEHALF, REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER IN A TRANSACTION COMPLYING WITH RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (C) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES TO NON U.S. PERSONS IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION IN COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (D) PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (E) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, AND IN EACH OF SUCH CASES IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAW OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES AND (3) AGREES THAT IT WILL DELIVER TO EACH PERSON TO WHOM THIS NOTE IS TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND. PROVIDED THAT THE ISSUER, THE TRUSTEE AND THE REGISTRAR SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT

Enforcement of judgments
The Issuer is organized under the laws of Sweden and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Sweden, Finland and Germany. None of the directors of the Issuer are residents of the United States, and many of the directors, officers and other executives of the Issuer and the Guarantors are neither residents nor citizens of the United States. All or a substantial portion of the Issuer's and the Guarantors' assets and the assets of the Issuer's and the Guarantors' non-U.S. resident directors and officers are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process in the United States upon the Issuer or the Guarantors or such persons in courts in jurisdictions inside the United States, in each case, in any action, including any actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state or territory within the United States despite the fact that, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the relevant Issuer and the relevant Guarantors have appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service of process in New York. In addition, there is doubt as to the enforceability, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, of liabilities predicated upon securities laws of the United States or of any state or territory within the United States. Awards of punitive damages and other types of penalty in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may be unenforceable in Sweden.
If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or any Guarantor, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in which our Guarantors are located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.
Sweden
Pursuant to the provisions of the Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of December 22, 2000 on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, as amended (the "Brussels I Regulation"), a judgment entered against a company in the courts of a Member State (as defined therein, i.e., all Member States of the EU) and which is enforceable in such a Member State will be directly enforceable in Sweden only upon the satisfaction of the following requirements: (a) that a motion for enforcement has been filed with and granted by the Svea Court of Appeal in Stockholm as provided by law and has been granted and (b) that the formal requirements in the Brussels I Regulation have been fulfilled. However, upon an appeal against the declaration of enforceability pursuant to the Brussels I Regulation, the Svea Court of Appeal may stay the proceedings.
With regard to the provisions of the 1988 and 2007 Lugano Conventions on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (the "Lugano Convention"), a judgment entered against a company in the courts of a Contracting State (as defined in the Lugano Convention) and which is enforceable in such a state, will be directly enforceable in Sweden only upon the satisfaction of the following requirements: (a) that a motion for enforcement has been filed with the Svea Court of Appeal in Stockholm as provided by law and has been granted; and (b) that the formal requirements in the Lugano Convention have been fulfilled.
Judgments entered against any Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not a member state under the terms of the Brussels I Regulation or a contracting state under the terms of the Lugano Convention (e.g., the United States) would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of law without retrial on the merits. If the party in whose favor the final judgment is rendered brings a new suit before a competent court in Sweden, the party may however submit to the Swedish court the final judgment that has been rendered in the United States. As a starting point, a judgment by a court in the United States will be regarded by a court, administrative tribunal or executive or other public authority of Sweden only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which the judgment relates, and a Swedish court may choose to rehear the dispute ab initio.
258

Finland
Certain guarantors are organized under the laws of Finland. Certain of the directors and members of the Executive Committee of the Guarantors and the Issuer are non-residents of the United States. All or a substantial portion of the assets of such non-resident persons and of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon such persons or the Issuer or to enforce against them in U.S. courts judgments obtained in such courts.
We have been advised by our Finnish counsel that there is no treaty on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters between the United States and Finland. Courts in Finland will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court.
Under Finnish law, a Finnish title for execution (i.e., a Finnish court judgment) is required for such recognition and enforcement; in seeking a Finnish court judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to the matter in dispute. The application by a Finnish court of foreign law in a matter brought before it is subject to (a) the foreign law not being contrary to such mandatory rules of Finnish law that due to their public nature or general interest would be considered applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law; and (b) the application of the foreign law not resulting in an outcome contrary to the public policy (ord re pu b lic) of the Finnish legal system.
As to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law and a Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation of actual losses and damages as proven by the claimant. A feature of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect to any claims presented lies, with certain rare exceptions, with the claimant. A party to legal proceedings in Finland is also ordinarily expected to plead its case primarily on the basis of the evidence in its own possession.
U.S. notions of discovery, including the expectation that broadly defined categories of documents and information in the possession of third parties will be readily accessible for use as evidence, are not recognized under Finnish law. The availability of documentation in the possession of counterparties or third parties is limited, and a party seeking to obtain such documents is required to be able to specify such documents with relative precision. Depositions are also a form of taking evidence unknown to Finnish law. In Finland, witness testimony is usually only taken at a separate oral main hearing (comparable to a U.S. trial) after the preparatory phase of the proceedings.
Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or moratorium as well as other similar mandatory laws affecting creditor's rights generally.
Germany
The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of court judgments, other than arbitral awards, in civil and commercial matters.
A final and conclusive judgment for payment of a specific amount of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. It may be recognized and enforced by a separate action of exequatur by the competent German courts in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (De. Z ivilp ro zesso rd n u n g ). In such an action, a German court will generally not review the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court. A favourable exequatur decision is, however, excluded, if:
 the courts of the state to which the foreign court belongs do not have jurisdiction according to German law;
259

 the judgment was given in default of appearance and the defendant invokes such default or the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings properly or within sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his or her defense;
 the judgment is irreconcilable with a judgment given in Germany or a previous, recognizable foreign judgment or the proceedings leading to such judgment are irreconcilable with proceedings that were filed (De. rechtshangig) previously;
 such recognition entails results which are obviously irreconcilable with fundamental principles of German law (De. o rd re p u b lic), including without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (De. G ru n d rech te); or
 the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is not guaranteed. Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having received an enforcement or exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. Federal or state courts. However, even if a U.S. judgment is recognized in Germany, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforced under all circumstances. In particular, the remedies need to be of a specific kind and type for which an enforcement procedure exists under German law. Also, if circumstances have arisen after the date on which such foreign judgment became res judicata, a defence against execution may arise. If an original action is brought before a German court, and the court does not decline jurisdiction, the court may apply not only EU and German rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of the EU and German law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions, particularly those relating to certain remedies, if the relevant application violates German public policy. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization. liquidation or moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditor's rights generally. German courts usually deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages. They are regarded to be in conflict with fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In as far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to the trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.

Fair value of financial instruments:
Ovako's financial instruments include derivatives, unlisted equities, loan receivables, accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing liabilities, trade payables and other liabilities. Derivatives are measured at fair value in Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13 i.e. fair value determined using valuation techniques with observable market data, either directly (such as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices). Other financial instruments are measured at amortised cost. Interest-bearing liabilities are recognised net of prepaid financing fees.

THIS IS A TRANSLATION FROM THE SWEDISH ORIGINAL
REVIEW REPORT
Ovako Group AB, org. nr 556813-5361 The Board of Directors Introduction We have reviewed the condensed interim report for Ovako Group AB as at March 31,2014 and for the three months period then ended. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation and presentation of this interim report in accordance with IAS 34 and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim report based on our review. Scope of review We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements, ISRE 2410 Review of Interim Reports Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A review consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, ISA, and other generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. The procedures performed in a review do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim report is not prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with IAS 34 and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act regarding the Group, and in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act regarding the Parent Company.

Interest bearing liabilities are recognised net of deferred financing costs, i.e. at amortised cost, see also Note 21. Available for sale financial assets include unlisted equities which are measured at acquisi tion value.
Information on the fair value of financial a s s e ts and liabilities:
Fair value of loans and receivables and other financial liabilities: For cash and cash equivalents, and for current receivables and liabilities, the fair value is considered to be equal to the carry ing amount. The fair value of interest-bearing liabilities has been calculated based on the discounted value of future payments, including interest and amortisation. In the calculation, manage ment has found no reason to presume changes have occurred in the interest margin that existed when the loans were raised. The difference between the carrying amount and fair value of non-current interest-bearing debt is primarily due to the deferred financing costs which reduced the carrying amount. Fair values of available for sale financial assets: Available for sale financial assets include unlisted equities which are measured at acquisition value and for which information on fair value cannot be reliably estimated.

Fair value of derivatives for hedge accounting: The fair value of derivatives is estimated with reference to quoted market prices. When such parameters are unavailable, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applica ble yield curve for the duration of the derivative and alternative pricing models for comparable derivatives. Foreign currency derivatives are estimated using the quoted exchange rate and the yield curve from a quoted interest rate that matches the contract maturity date. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on a suitable yield curve from a listed stock exchange.
M e a su re m e n ts of a s s e t s and liabilities are cla ss ifie d in a fair value hierarchy a s follows:
Level 1: Fair value is determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments; Level 2: Fair value is determined based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and Level 3: Fair value is determined based on inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. Ovako's derivatives are Level 2. Interest-bearing liabilities are Level 3.

NOTE 19. PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

The group has entered into a number of pension plans in accordance with local regulations and agreements. These include both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Certain group companies have specific pension plans for management personnel.
In Sweden, there are both defined contribution plans, for which pension payments are managed by insurance companies, and defined benefit plans, for which the group's pension obligations are secured in the Swedish PRI/ FPG system.
Pension benefits in Finnish companies are secured by local insurance companies and a voluntary pension agreement cov ered by supplemental insurance. Pensions in Finland are mainly covered by the statutory TEL pension system. Some individual agreements may cover early retirement or disability. There are other long-term service benefits in some instances, such as com pensation for long service.
The plans of other foreign subsidiaries are structured in accordance with local rules and customary practice.
The group's cost for defined contribution plans, excluding special payroll tax, amounted to EUR 6.7 (7.6) million. Cash flows associated with defined benefit plans are expected to amount to EUR 3.5 million in 2014.

Defined benefit plans: The largest plan, which accounts for approximately 90% of the group's pension liabilities in the balance sheet, is the Swedish plan secured in the Swedish PRI/FPG system. The average maturity of this liability is approximately 15 years. In addition, the UK subsidiary has a funded defined benefit pension and life assurance plan that was closed to new subscribers as of 31 December 2009. This plan continues to have a deficit and payments are being made to the fund as planned. Other smaller plans include a plan for senior executives (current and former) in Germany, which is also closed to new subscriptions, and a plan for medical and drug costs for certain employees and former employees in the USA.

Financing agreement
In conjunction with the change of ownership in 2010, Ovako Group AB and subsidiaries entered into a new financing agree ment totalling EUR 385 million. The agreement includes two loans, originally of EUR 100 million (Facility A, which matures in Sep

tember 2015) and of EUR 210 million (Facility B, which matures in September 2016), plus a revolving credit facility of EUR 75 million. EUR 5 million of the revolving credit has been set aside for bank guarantees. Facility A is amortised over the term of the loan, both through voluntary repayments and in accordance with the terms of the loan, while Facility B matures in full in September 2016.
At year-end the liability for Facility A amounted to EUR 42.0 (57.1) million, and the liability for Facility B amounted to EUR 210.0 (210.0) million. In addition, EUR 20 (0) million of the revolving credit has been utilised, which means that total utilised credit at 31 December therefore amounted to EUR 272.0 (267.1) million. EUR 4.3 (3.8) of the revolving credit facility was set aside in the form of issued bank guarantees, which means the unutilised facility amounts to EUR 50.7 (71.2) million.
The interest rate for the loans is EURIBOR 1 month plus lend ing margin. The terms of the group's financing agreement have been renegotiated during the year resulting in an annual increase of financing costs slightly above EUR 3 million.
Under the terms of the loan, the company must ensure compli ance with covenants based on cash flow, interest coverage ratio, leverage, capital expenditures and EBITDA. The company was in compliance with all covenants at the reporting date. All shares in large group subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral for the loans. In addition, the subsidiaries have issued property mort gages and floating charges. See also Note 29. Arrangement fees were paid in conjunction with the drawdown. Arrangement fees are amortised over the term of the loan and recognised as a prepaid expense that reduces interest-bearing-liabilities. Rearrangement fees paid in connection with the renegotiation in 2013 are also amortised over the average remaining term of the loan.

The group's finance policy, adopted by the Board of Directors, provides guidance on managing these financial risks. The pur pose of the policy is to establish general financial targets, alloca tion of responsibilities and threshold limits in respect of financial risks, and to describe actions that can be taken to mitigate these financial risks within the framework of strategic and operational financial risk management of the group and its business units.
The main objective of group financial risk management is to mitigate the adverse impacts of financial risks on consolidated earnings, cash flows and equity and to assure adequate liquidity.
The group shall not engage in hedging transactions or financial transactions that are unrelated to operating activities or may otherwise be regarded as inappropriate management of the group's financial exposure. Purely speculative financial transac tions are not permitted.
The majority of the group's financial transactions and financial risk management are managed centrally through group treasury.
MMaarrkkeett rriisskkis the risk of market changes in interest rates and exchange rates or other prices that affect the group's revenues and/or financial position. Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk of changes in exchange rates that adversely affect the company's earnings, equity and competitive ness. Currency risk is treated as translation exposure or transac tion exposure.
Translation exposure arises from translation of currencies in subsidiaries' financial statements to the group's presentation currency. Translations that cause fluctuations in consolidated equity comprise investments in subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro (EUR). Since all major subsidiaries, including those in Sweden, use the euro as their functional currency translation exposure is very limited.
Transaction exposure arises from exchange rate changes in net cash flow from business transactions in currencies other than the functional currency. These changes affect profit and loss and the balance sheet continually throughout the year The group's borrowings are denominated in EUR and are intended to act as hedges against anticipated operating inflows in euro. Other currency flows that arise in connection with purchases and sales are short-term in nature.

Ovako is exposed to currency risk because the group's functional currency is the EUR, while a portion of revenues and a large share of expenses are denominated in other currencies. The greatest currency risk is linked to the Swedish krona (SEK) primarily because a large part of Ovako's production costs are in SEK. Appreciation of the Swedish krona by 10% in relation to the euro would have an estimated annualised negative impact on consolidated operating profit of approximately EUR 19 (19) million based on 2013 (2012) sales and not taking into account foreign exchange hedges.
Most of Ovako group's sales are in euro. The currency split for sales in 2013 was approximately as follows: 61 (62) % EUR, 28 (28) % SEK and 11 (10) % other currencies (mainly GBP and USD). The underlying purchase prices of key raw materials, such as iron scrap and alloys, are set in global or European markets and the functional purchasing currency is thus USD or EUR, even if the actual purchase may be invoiced in SEK.
Management may from time to time decide to hedge contractual net exposures from sales and purchases in currencies other than the functional currency to hedge margins. No currency deriva tives have existed for most of 2013 (or in 2012), but in November 2013 the group signed a foreign exchange forward contract that hedges approximately 37% of the estimated net outflow in SEK during 2014, with a total value of approximately EUR 75 million. Hedge accounting is applied and the currency derivatives are designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, where the initial gross flows in SEK amounting to a certain amount are hedged each month. Further information is provided in Note 13. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk refers to the risk that changes in market rates will have an adverse impact on consolidated earnings. At 31 De cember 2013, the group had one interest rate swap with a value of EUR 150 million at fixed rates, which will mature in 2014. In the previous year the group also had an additional interest rate swap of EUR 120 million that matured in 2013. An increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points (1 percentage) would impact total comprehensive income for the year before tax by EUR 1.4 (3.8) million as a result of revaluation of the interest rate swap. Hedge accounting is applied since interest rate derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Further information is provided in Note 13. Electricity price risk Electricity price risk refers to the risk that changes in market prices for electricity will have an adverse impact on consolidated earnings.
The group's normal annual consumption of electricity is approximately 1 TWh. To mitigate price volatility that causes fluctuations in cash flows and earnings, the group uses hedging measures by which portions of the variable price of electricity are transferred to a fixed price, as well as purchase contracts with a fixed price. At year-end 2013, anticipated future electricity consumption was hedged as follows: 57 % for 2014 and 38 % for 2015. Of these hedging measures, electricity derivates account for 42 and 28 percent respectively, whereas fixed price contracts account for 15 and 10 percent respectively. The cash flow from the electricity derivatives amounts to EUR 16.2 million and EUR 10.6 million, respectively, during 2014 and 2015. A rise of 10% in the price of electricity compared to the price at 31 December 2013 would have an impact on Ovako's comprehensive income, before tax, of approximately EUR 2.1 (3.6) million due to revaluation of the derivatives.
The group uses hedge accounting for electricity derivatives since these have been designated as cash flow hedges. Further information is provided in Note 13.

NOTE 23. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT, cont. LLiiqquuiiddiittyy aanndd rreeffiinnaanncciinngg rriisskk is the risk of the group having insufficient access to the funds necessary to meet its obligations.
The group's financing is achieved through the financing agree ment signed in 2010, as further described in Note 21. As described in Note 21, there are loan covenants, which may pose a risk to the company's access to capital. Total credit utilised at 31 December amounted to EUR 272.0 (267.1) million including utilisation of revolving credit of EUR 20 (0) million. Of the revolving credit facility totalling EUR 75.0 million, EUR 4.3 (3.8) has been set aside in the

form of issued bank guarantees, which means the unutilised facility amounts to EUR 50.7 (71.2) million.
Surplus liquidity is used primarily to repay debt. When this is not possible, the surplus funds are invested within internally defined limits with banks that are counterparties to the group's credit agreements.
The maturity structure of debt over future years is presented in Note 21. The table below shows contractual undiscounted pay ments including amortisation, interest and interest-rate derivatives linked to the financing agreement.

CCrreeddiitt rainskd icsoduenfitneerpdaarstythreiskrisk that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations. The group is exposed to credit and counterparty risk against financial counterparties when funds are deposited, when positive cash balances are maintained with banks and when financial derivatives are acquired. These risks are minimised by contracting only with financially stable banks or other counterparties.
Beyond the foregoing, credit risks are associated with trade receivables. Exposure to credit risk in trade receivables is ma naged according to the principles set out in the Credit Manage ment Rules and Guidelines established by group management. According to these principles credit risk in trade receivables is managed primarily through credit risk insurance, but also bank guarantees, advance and cash payment requirements and letter of credit to reduce the credit risk. A credit limit is established for each customer by Ovakos' insurance company or Ovakos' internal credit control. The non-covered part of the trade receivables should not exceed 2% of estimated yearly invoicing. At year-end,

over 95% of Ovako's outstanding trade receivables were covered by credit insurance. The five largest customers (groups including subsidiaries) account for approximately 30% of consolidated sales and trade receivables.

AUDITOR'S REPORT

Independent auditor's report

To the annual meeting of the shareh o ld ers of O vako Group A B , corporate identity num ber 556813-5361

Report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts
We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of Ovako Group AB for the year 1January 2013 - 31 December 2013. The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included in the printed version of this document on pages 25-59. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the CEO for the annual accounts and consolidated accounts The Board of Directors and the CEO are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these annual accounts in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and of the consolidat ed accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards , as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors and the CEO determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annu al accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error

Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accord ance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all mate rial respects, the financial position of the group as of 31 Decem ber 2013 and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Report ing Standards, as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.
We therefore recommend that the annual meeting of sharehold ers adopt the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the group. RIneapdodrtitioonn otothoeurrlaeguadlitaonfdthreegaunlnautoarl yacrecqouuinrtesmaenndtsconsolidated accounts, we have also audited the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss and the administration of the Board of Directors and the CEO of Ovako Group AB for the financial year 1 January 2013 - 31 December 2013.

Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these annual accounts and consolidated accounts based on our audit. We con ducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evi dence about the amounts and disclosures in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. The procedures selected depend on the auditor'sjudgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts and consoli dated accounts, whether due to fraud or error In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the annu al accounts and consolidated accounts in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonable ness of accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors and the CEO, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the annu al accounts and consolidated accounts.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. Opinions In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accord ance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all materi al respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 31 December 2013 and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the CEO The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appro priations of the company's profit or loss, and the Board of Direc tors and the CEO are responsible for administration under the Companies Act. Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion with reasonable assur ance on the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss and on the administration based on our audit. We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing stand ards in Sweden.
As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors' proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss, we examined whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.
As a basis for our opinion concerning discharge from liabili ty, in addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidat ed accounts, we examined significant decisions, actions taken and circumstances of the company in order to determine wheth er any member of the Board of Directors or the CEO is liable to the company. We also examined whether any member of the Board of Directors or the CEO has, in any other way, acted in contraven tion of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Arti cles of Association.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Opinions We recommend to the annual meeting of shareholders that the profit be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the stat utory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the CEO be discharged from liability for the finan cial year

n o t e 1. s u m m a r y o f s ig n if ic a n t a c c o u n t in g p o l ic ie s

General Information Ovako Group AB (company registration number 556813-5361) and domiciled in Stockholm is owned by Triako Holdco AB (company regis tration number 556813-5379), which is the Swedish parent o f the group. Triako Holdco AB is 100 % owned by Oven Luxco Sarl in Luxembourg. Triton Fund III controls, directly and indirectly, 83.34% of equity in the Ovako group.
The registered address of both Ovako Group AB and Triako Holdco AB is Box 5013, 194 61 Upplands Vsby. Consolidated financial state ments have also been prepared for Triako Holdco AB.
The object of the company's business is to own and manage shares in other companies that develop, manufacture and sell steel products, and to engage in related business.
The annual report and consolidated financial statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2012 were authorised by the Board of Directors for publication on 1 March 2013. The consolidated and parent company financial statements will be presented to the annual general meeting for adoption on 23 April 2013.
Consolidated financial statements
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements for the 2012 financial year have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) for the finan cial year beginning 1January 2012. Recommendation R FR 1 Supple mentary Accounting Rules for Groups issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board has also been applied.
The financial statements are presented in euro (EUR) rounded to the nearest million. All individual figures (including subtotals and totals) are rounded to the nearest million. From the presentation perspective, individual figures may not therefore precisely reflect their sum totals.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis unless otherwise explained in the accounting policies.
The accounting policies below have, unless stated otherwise, been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
Uncertainty related to judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as other disclosures.
Estimates and related assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors believed to represent the best available parameters for measuring assets and liabilities. Actual outcomes may differ from the estimates. The estimates and judgements discussed in this section are those judged most important to understanding the group's financial statements.
Impairment testing
The carrying amounts of the group's non-current assets are tested to determine whether there is any indication o f impairment loss when events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount will not be recovered. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is measured as the discounted present value of future cash flows expected to arise from the asset or the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. No indica tions of impairment in the group's non-current assets were found during the financial year. There is no goodwill recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
Pension benefit assumptions
Pension benefit obligations are based on actuarial valuations. A discount rate is used to measure the present value o f the defined benefit obligation. These assumptions are assessed at least once a year for all plans in each

country. Other assumptions, which may relate to demographic factors such as age of retirement, mortality rates and employee turnover, are reviewed less frequently and usually based on public statistics in each country.
Valuation o f inventories
Valuations of inventories contain estimates of net realisable value and assumptions pertaining to cost distribution and normal capacity, which may affect the carrying amount.
Business combinations Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost is calculated as the sum of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition-date fair value and the value of any non-controlling influence in the acquiree, either at fair value or proportionate share of identifiable net assets in the acquiree. Acquisition and transaction costs are recognised as they arise as either an operating expense or a finance expense, depending on the nature o f the expense.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company Ovako Group AB and all companies in which the parent directly or indirectly holds more than 50% ofvoting rights or, on another basis, directly or indirectly exerts controlling influence.
Equity holdings in subsidiaries have been eliminated using the acquisi tion method. The financial statements of group companies are incorpo rated in the consolidated financial statements as of the date the group obtains control over the acquiree until such control ceases. Intra-group transactions, receivables, liabilities, unrealised gains and intra-group dividends are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are eliminated only to the extent there is no evidence of impairment loss.
Associates are companies in which the Ovako group holds more than 20% ofvoting rights or over which the group otherwise has significant but not controlling influence. At the end of the year, Ovako had one asso ciate in which the equity interest exceeded 20%. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. The share of the profits or losses of associates is recognised in profit and loss and the share of total equity constitutes the value of the investment in the balance sheet.
Foreign currency translation Transactions are recorded in the functional currency of the respective unit. The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment (determined e.g. through the prices of its goods and services) in which group companies operate.
Transactions in foreign currencies (other than the functional currency) are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the transaction date. Mon etary assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate. Exchange gains and losses arising upon translation are recognised in profit and loss. Exchange gains and losses related to trade receivables or trade payables are treated as adjustments to the respective item and included in operating profit and loss. Exchange differences related to financing are included in finance income and expense. Non monetary items are translated at the rate in effect at the transaction date.
In the consolidated financial statements, the income statements of foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the group's presentation currency have been translated to E U R at the average rate for the reporting period. The balance sheets of subsidiaries have been translated to EU R at the closing rate. Foreign currency translation differ ences arising from translations of income statements and balance sheets are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve, which is a separate component of equity. Foreign currency translation differences arising from the transla tion of net investments in foreign subsidiaries are also transferred to the translation reserve via other comprehensive income.

Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost adjusted for cumulative depreciation and impairment, if any. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the asset are capitalised as a component o f cost if the time required to bring the asset to working condition for its intended use or sale is material. In accordance with Ovako's definitions, borrowing costs are capitalised for capital expenditures amounting to at least E U R 20 million and which are expected to take at least 12 months to complete. There were no capital expenditures in 2012 (2011: None) for which bor rowing costs were capitalised. The cost of self-constructed assets includes expenditures for materials, direct payroll costs and a reasonable share of production-related overheads. To the extent assets consist of components with material differences in useful lives, they are depreciated separately using `component depreciation'. Expenditures for major repairs and main tenance are included in the carrying amount of the asset and depreciated over the remaining useful life to the extent they increase the economic benefit derived from the asset. Customary expenditures for repairs and maintenance are recognised as an expense as incurred. Items o f property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset to an estimated residual value. Estimated useful lives are:

Buildings Process machinery and equipment Computers Other machinery and equipment

10-40 years 15-20 years
3-5 years 3-10 years

Residual values and estimated useful lives of items o f property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each reporting date. If they differ materially from earlier estimates, they are adjusted to the new estimate. Capital gains or losses arising from the disposal of items of property, plant and equipment are recognised in other operating income or expense.

Government grants and comparable assistance Government grants and comparable assistance are recognised in profit and loss in the period in which the underlying expenses are incurred. The group received no significant government grants during the report ing period. Group companies that are parties to the EU emission trad ing scheme have been allotted emissions credits with no performance requirements attached.

Intangible assets Ovako's intangible assets comprise mainly software, licences, trademarks and comparable rights. These intangible assets are recognised in the balance sheet at cost less cumulative amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset to an estimated residual value. The estimated useful life of intangible assets is normally between 5 and 10 years. Residual values and estimated useful lives of items of intangible assets are reviewed at each reporting date. I f they differ materially from earlier estimates, they are adjusted to the new estimate.

Research and development costs Research costs are recognised in profit and loss as incurred. The group has no development costs that meet the criteria for capitalisation under IAS 38 Intangible Assets.

Impairment of assets Annually on the reporting date, the carrying amount of consolidated goodwill, if any, is assessed and an impairment loss recognised if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. At 31 December 2012 no consolidated goodwill (2011: None) had been recognised in the balance sheet. The group's other non-current assets are assessed annu ally to determine whether there any indications of impairment. If such indications are found, the recoverable amount o f the asset is estimated. The recovery value is the higher of net realisable value and value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to arise for an asset or cash generating unit containing goodwill. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or cash generat ing unit exceeds the recoverable amount. Within the Ovako group, the recoverable amount is based on value in use and calculated at the cash generating unit level or the individual asset level when it is possible to identify separate cash flows for the asset.
Leases Determination of whether an agreement is, or contains, a lease depends upon the substance o f the agreement when it is made; whether perfor mance of the contract depends on the use of a specific asset or assets or if the agreement conveys a right to control the asset, even if the right is not explicitly laid out in the agreement. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers to the lessee substantially all risks and rewards incident to ownership o f the leased property. Finance leases are initially recognised in the balance sheet at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the asset. Leases in which the lessor substantially retains all risks and rewards incident to ownership are classified as operating leases. Lease payments for operating leases are recognised as an expense in profit and loss over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, where cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The weighted average cost method is used when it provides a more reliable picture of certain types of inventory items. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes the cost of materials, direct labour, other direct costs and an allocation o f allocatable indirect costs based on normal capacity. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs for completion and costs to sell.
Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefits are calculated without discounting and are recognised as a cost when the related services are rendered. A provision is reported for the expected cost o f bonus payments when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation to make such payments due to services being rendered by employees and the commitment can be reliably calculated.
Post-employment benefits Ovako has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. Plans are classified as defined contribution pension plans when the group's obligations are limited to the amount that the company has agreed to pay. Pension expenses for the defined contribution plans are recognised in profit and loss as the employees perform their services. Obligations are calculated without discounting as payments for all these plans are due within 12 months.
The Projected Unit Credit Method is applied to calculate allocations to defined benefit plans, which in summary means that each period o f service gives rise to a component that contributes to the final total obligation and that each such component is measured independently to build up the amount of the obligation at the end of the reporting period. The obligation is discounted to a present value at the end o f the reporting period, from which the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.

F-50

CONSOLIDATED FiNANCiAL STATEMENTS

In addition, the calculations are affected by actuarial assumptions, such as mortality rates, employee turnover rates and estimated salary trends. Actuarial gains and losses arise when an assumption changes or when actual outcome deviates from the assumption. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in comprehensive income for the year.
The discount rate used to calculate the present value o f defined benefit obligations outside Sweden is the yield on high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds with a similar maturity as the obligation. Pension liabilities in Sweden account for approximately 89 percent o f the group's pension benefits obligations, and secured housing bonds are used to establish the discounting rate for this liability.
When there is a difference between how pension expenses are determined in a legal entity and in the group, a provision or receivable is recognised for special employer's contribution based on this difference. No present value is calculated for the provision or receivable.
Share-based payments The group currently has no share-based incentive programmes.
Provisions A provision is recognised when the group has a present legal or con structive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be estimated reliably. The expected future cash flow is discounted to calculate provisions when the time value of money is material. A provision for restructuring will be recognised only if the group has adopted a detailed formal plan and the restructuring has either com menced or been publicly announced.
Income taxes The group's recognised tax expense comprises tax on the taxable income of group companies for the period and adjustments, if any, for taxes for previous periods and changes in deferred tax. Current income taxes are calculated based on the tax rates and tax rules in effect in each country. Deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are calculated using the balance sheet method based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and fiscal amounts of assets and liabilities. The most significant temporary differences arise from non-current assets, unutilised loss carry forwards, unrealised intra-group gains and provisions. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are determined at the rates in effect for the period when the asset is realised or the liability paid based on tax rates (and legislation) enacted or announced at the reporting date. The effects of deferred tax assets and tax liabilities recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised according to the same prin ciples. Income tax is recognised in profit and loss for the year, except when the underlying transaction is recognised in other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the tax effect is recognised in other comprehen sive income or equity.
Revenue recognition Revenue from goods sold is recognised when the seller has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration that has been or will be received, less VAT,discounts and returns. Interest, dividends and royalties are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits of the transaction will flow to the enterprise and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or financial liability is recognised on the balance sheet when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A receivable is recognised when the company has performed a service/supplied a product and the counterparty is contractually obliged to pay, even if an invoice has not yet been sent. Accounts receivable are

entered on the balance sheet when an invoice is sent. A liability is entered when the counterparty has rendered a service or supplied a product and there is a contractual obligation to pay, even if an invoice has not yet been received. Accounts payable are recognised when an invoice is received. A financial asset is removed from the balance sheet when the rights in the agreement are realised, expire, or the company loses control of them. The same applies to part of a financial asset. A financial liability is removed from the balance sheet when the obligation in the agreement is fulfilled or otherwise expires. The same applies to part of a financial liability. Pur chases and sales of derivatives are recognised on the trade date.
Financial instruments are initially recognised at acquisition cost corre sponding to the fair value of the instrument, plus transaction costs, except for derivatives, for which transaction costs are immediately expensed. A financial instrument is classified on initial recognition based on, among other things, the purpose for which it was acquired. A ll financial assets and liabilities are classified into the following categories:  Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit
and loss: Ovako has no financial instruments classified in this category. The sub-category of financial instruments held for trading includes derivatives not used for hedge accounting. Ovako currently has no financial instruments classified in this category.  Held to maturity investments: Ovako has no financial instruments classified in this category.  Loan receivables and trade receivables: Ovako's trade receivables, other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents are included in this category.  Available-for-sale financial assets: This category comprises financial assets that are not classified in any other category, such as equities and investments in both listed and non-listed companies. This category includes Ovako's shares in unlisted companies.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables include assets arising on transfer of cash, goods or services to a debtor. They are included as current or non-current depend ing on the maturity date. Loans issued by the group are recognised at amortised cost. An impairment of a loan or receivable is recognised when there is objective evidence of impairment. Such indications may be absent or delayed payments, significant financial difficulties o f the debtor, or that it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation. Trade receivables are recognised at the original amount billed less any impairment losses. The valuation of impaired loans is based on the estimated credit risk of each item on the reporting date.
Cash and bank balances
Cash and bank balances include liquid bank balances and cash in hand as well as short-term bank deposits with a remaining maturity from acquisi tion date of three months or less.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Ovako's financial assets available for sale include unlisted equities, for which fair value cannot be determined reliably. These are valued at cost less any impairment losses.
Financial liabilities at amortised cost
Accounts payable and loans payable are classified as other financial liabilities. Accounts payable are short-term and are measured without dis counting at nominal value. Loans payable are classified as other financial liabilities, which means they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs, etc.
Loan arrangement costs are capitalised over the term of the loan and recognised as prepayments that reduce interest-bearing-liabilities. Charges paid for loan commitments are reported as transaction costs for borrowing to the extent it is probable that all or part of the credit limit will be utilised. In such cases, the charge is reported when the credit limit is utilised. When there is no evidence that it is probable that all or part

F-51

CONSOLIDATED FiNANCiAL STATEMENTS

of the credit limit will be utilised, the charge is reported as a prepayment for financial services and allocated over the maturity of the relevant loan commitment.
Derivatives and hedge accounting Financial derivatives are classified either as hedging instruments or instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss. Derivatives are initially measured at cost and subsequent to initial recognition are measured at fair value at each reporting date. The fair value of electricity forwards and interest rate swaps is based on observable market data at the reporting date. Ovako had no currency forwards in the balance sheet at the end of the year. The group applies hedge accounting for forward contracts related to electricity prices and interest rate swaps that meet the hedging criteria defined in IAS 39. Changes in the value of hedging instruments that are part of an effective cash flow hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income and shown in the hedge reserve in equity, while hedge ineffectiveness is recognised immediately in profit and loss. The cumulative change in value of such derivatives is transferred to net profit or loss in the same period as the hedged item affects profit and loss.
Future accounting policies The following describes the new IFRSs that will have, or are expected to have, an impact on the consolidated financial statements. The new IFRSs published by the IASB on 31 December 2012 and that are not described below are not expected to have any effect on the consolidated financial statements. Ovako does not intend to apply the new IFR Ss early.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures - Amendments
Amendments to IFR S 7 introduce new disclosure requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. The new disclosure requirements mean that disclosure must be provided for financial assets and financial liabilities have been offset in the balance sheet. Disclosure should also be provided for financial assets and financial liabilities subject to various types of framework agreement or similar agreements allowing setoff, whether they are offset or not. The amendments enter into force on 1 January 2013 and will also apply to interim reports during the first year. The amendments have been approved by the EU. The group has identified the financial instruments affected by these new disclosure requirements. The amendments have no substantive impact on amounts in the financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 is a new standard that is being developed to replace IAS 39 Fi nancial Instruments: Classification and measurement. The first part of the revision of the standard has been published and relates to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 con tains two primary measurement categories for financial assets: fair value or amortised cost. Classification is determined at initial recognition based on the group's business model and the contractual cash flows characteristics. For financial liabilities there are no major changes compared to IAS 39. The biggest change relates to liabilities that are designated at fair value. In these cases, the portion of the fair value change that is attributable to its own credit risk is recognised in other comprehensive income rather than profit and loss, unless this causes inconsistencies in the statements. The standard is currently expected to take effect not earlier than 1 January 2015. The EU has not yet approved the standard. Until all parts of the standard are complete the group has chosen not to evaluate the impact of the new standard.
IFRS 10 Consolidated financialstatements
IFRS 10 replaces the section of IAS 27 relating to presentation of consolidated accounts. The treatment of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in separate financial statements will remain in IAS 27. IFRS 10 builds on existing principles as it identifies control as the determining

factor for assessing whether a company should be included in the con solidated financial statements. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination o f control where this is difficult to assess. The standard is effective from 1 January 2013, but the E U has decided to postpone the first application to 1January 2014. The introduction of IFR S 10 is not expected to affect which companies the group currently consolidates, but may affect the assessment of which companies will be consolidated in the future.
IFRS 12 Disclosure o f interests in other entities
IFRS 12 includes disclosure requirements for subsidiaries, joint arrange ments, associates and unconsolidated structured entities. The standard is effective from 1January 2013, but the E U has decided to postpone the first application to 1 January 2014. The introduction of IFR S 12 is expected to affect the disclosures currently provided for subsidiaries. However, the group has not yet assessed the way in which disclosures may be affected.
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement
IFR S 13 contains uniform rules for measuring fair value where other standards permit or require reporting or disclosure of fair values. The standard is designed to ensure that fair value measurement will be more consistent and less complex in that the standard provides a precise defini tion and a common framework of IFR S fair value measurement and associated disclosures. The standard is effective from 1January 2013 and the EU has approved the standard. The group considers that the introduc tion of IFRS 13 will not affect the measurement at fair value, i.e. how the value is calculated, but the introduction of IFRS 13 will require additional disclosures about fair value in both interim reports and the annual report.
IAS 1 Presentation of financialstatements - Amendments
Amendments to IAS 1 introduce new presentation requirements for other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income is changed so that items to be reclassified as profit and loss must be reported separately from items that will never be reclassified. The amendments enter into force for the financial year beginning 1 July 2012 or later and have been approved by the EU. Based on the changes in value recognised in other comprehensive income, the group will be affected in that there will be both items reclassified to profit and loss (cash flow hedging) and items not reclassified to profit and loss (revaluation of pensions, see below).
IAS 19 Employee benefits - Amendments
Amendments to IAS 19 provide, among other things, new accounting principles for defined benefit pension plans. The corridor approach and the ability to immediately recognise actuarial gains and losses disappear. In addition, the interest rate for calculating pension liabilities must also be used for estimated returns on pension assets. Furthermore, revalua tions are recognised in other comprehensive income, i.e. actuarial gains and losses and the difference between actual and expected returns on pension assets must be recognised in other comprehensive income. The amendments enter into force for financial years commencing 1January 2013 or later and have been approved by the EU. Within the group there are defined benefit pension plans and the group has already chosen to recognise actuarial gains and losses directly in other comprehensive income. However, the amendments introduced in IAS 19 with regard to the calculation o f pensions will mean some changes, and the revaluation that will in future be recognised in other comprehensive income will not have exactly the same composition as previously recognised.

Information on measurement methods etc: Derivatives are measured at fair value. Loans and receivables and other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. Interest-bearing liabilities are recognised net of deferred financing costs, i.e. at amortised cost, see also Note 21. Available for sale financial assets include unlisted equities which are measured at cost. For further information on interest-bearing liabilities, see Note 21. Further specification of derivatives can be found in Notes 16 and 22.
Information on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities:
Fair value o f loans and receivables and other financial liabilities:
For cash and cash equivalents, and for current receivables and liabilities, the fair value is considered to be equal to the carrying amount. The fair value of interest-bearing liabilities has been calculated based on the discounted value o f future payments, including interest and amortisation. In the calculation, management has found no reason to presume changes have occurred in the interest margin that existed when the loans were raised. The difference between the carrying amount and fair value of non-current interest-bearing debt is primarily due to the deferred financing costs which reduced the carrying amount.
Fair values o f available for sale financial assets:
Available for sale financial assets include unlisted equities which are measured at cost and for which information on fair value cannot be reliably estimated.
Fair value o f derivatives for hedge accounting:
The fair value of derivatives is estimated with reference to quoted market prices. When such parameters are unavailable, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the derivative and alternative pricing models for comparable derivatives. Foreign currency hedges are estimated using the quoted exchange rate and the yield curve from a quoted interest rate that matches the contract maturity date. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on a suitable yield curve from a listed stock exchange.
Measurements of assets and liabilities are classified in a fair value hierarchy as follows: Level 1: Fair value is determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2: Fair value is determined based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and Level 3: Fair value is determined based on inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. Ovako's derivatives are Level 2.

The group has entered into a number of pension plans in accordance with local regulations and agreements
In Sweden, which accounts for 90 (89) % of the group's pension liabilities, there are both defined contribution plans, for which pension payments are managed by insurance companies, and defined benefit plans, for which the group's pension obligations are secured in the Swedish PRI/ FPG system. Certain group companies have specific pension plans for management personnel.
The plans of foreign subsidiaries are structured in accordance with local rules and customary practice.
Pension benefits in Finnish companies are secured by local insurance companies and a voluntary pension agreement covered by supplemental insurance. Pensions in Finland are mainly covered by the statutory TyEL pension system. Some individual agreements may cover early retirement or disability. There are other long-term service benefits in some instances, such as compensation for long service.
The current pension system in the Netherlands is implemented within the Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds (industrial sector pension fund) 'Stichting Pensioenfonds Metaal en Techniek'(Pension Fund for the Engineering, Mechanical and Electric Contracting Sector). These are defined benefit plans but are treated as defined contribution plans in the annual accounts because sufficient parameters are unavailable to perform defined benefit plan calculations under IAS 19.
Ovako has a pension and life assurance plan for its employees in the UK. The plan was created as a defined benefit plan, which had a deficit at 31 December. The plan was closed to new subscribers as of 31 December 2009.
Ovako North America Inc offers defined contribution plans open to all employees who have worked for the company for at least six months. The company also has a post-employment medical insurance plan for certain employees and former employees.
Employees in Germany are covered by public pension schemes. The president and two other key management personnel also have a supple mental, defined benefit plan. The majority of the defined benefit pension plan refers to supplemental insurance for former executives. The pension liability is insured.
Employees in Italy are covered by national pension schemes and the T R F severance pay system with no additional pension plans. The T R F liability is recognised as a defined benefit pension plan.
The French pension liability is covered by pensions under French law and collective agreements (A ARCO/AGIRC). Accordingly, the company does not have its own pension plan. Ovako Redon SAS has a defined benefit pension liability created for the IFC components of the mandatory pension (a retirement indemnity plan).
Pensions in Poland and Russia are covered by government pension schemes.
The group's cost for defined contribution plans amounted to EUR 7.6 (8.4) million. Cash flows associated with defined benefit plans are expected to amount to approximately EU R 3.4 million in 2013.

Financing agreement In conjunction with the change of ownership in 2010, Ovako Group AB and subsidiaries entered into a new financing agreement totalling EU R 385 million. The agreement includes two loans, originally of EU R 100 million (Facility A, which matures in September 2015) and of EU R 210 million (Facility B, which matures in September 2016), plus a revolving credit facility of EU R 75 million. E U R 5 million of the revolving credit has been set aside for bank guarantees. Facility A is amortised over the term of the loan, both through voluntary repayments and in accordance with the terms o f the loan, while Facility B matures in full in September 2016.
At year-end the liability for Facility A amounted to E U R 57.1 (86.0) million, and the liability for Facility B amounted to E U R 210.0 (210.0) million. Total unutilised credit at 31 December therefore amounted to

E U R 267.1 (296.0) million. E U R 3.8 million of the revolving credit was utilised in the form of issued bank guarantees, which means the unutilised facility amounts to E U R 71.2 (75.0) million.
The interest rate for the loans is the average annual IBO R plus lending margin. Under the terms of the loan, the company must ensure compliance with financial covenants based on cash flow, interest coverage ratio, leverage in relation to E B IT D A and capital expenditures. The company was in compliance with all covenants at the reporting date. A ll shares in large group subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral for the loans. In addition, the subsidiaries have issued property mortgages and floating charges. See also Note 29. Arrangement fees were paid in conjunction with the drawdown. Arrangement costs are amortised over the term of the loan and recognised as a reduction of interest-bearing-liabilities.

n o t e 23. f in a n c ia l RISK MANAGEMENT
The group is exposed to various types of financial risks including market risks, liquidity and refinancing risks and credit and counterparty risks.
The group's finance policy, adopted by the Board o f Directors, pro vides guidance on managing these financial risks. The purpose of the policy is to establish general financial targets, allocation o f responsibili ties and threshold limits in respect of financial risks, and to describe actions that can be taken to mitigate these financial risks within the framework of strategic and operational financial risk management of the group and its business units.
The main objective of group financial risk management is to mitigate the adverse impacts of financial risks on consolidated earnings, cash flows and equity and to assure adequate liquidity.
The group shall not engage in hedging transactions or financial transactions that are unrelated to operating activities or may otherwise be regarded as inappropriate management of the group's financial expo sure. Purely speculative financial transactions are not permitted.
The majority o f the group's financial transactions and financial risk management are managed centrally through group treasury.
Market risk Market risk is the risk of market changes in interest rates and exchange rates or other prices that affect the group's revenues and/or financial position.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk of changes in exchange rates that adversely affect the company's earnings, equity and competitiveness. Currency risk is treated as translation exposure or transaction exposure.
Translation exposure arises from translation of currencies in subsidiaries' financial statements to the group's presentation currency. Translations that cause fluctuations in consolidated equity comprise investments in subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro (EUR). Since all major subsidiaries, including those in Sweden, use the euro as their base currency translation exposure is very limited.

Transaction exposure arises from exchange rate changes in net cash flow from business transactions in currencies other than the base currency. These changes affect profit and loss and the balance sheet continually throughout the year. The group's borrowings are denominated in EU R and are intended to act as hedges against anticipated operating inflows in euro. Other currency flows that arise in connection with purchases and sales are short-term in nature and normally not hedged. Management may decide from time to time to hedge contracted exposure from sales and purchases in currencies other than the base or trading currency to secure margins, but no currency hedges existed during the year.
Ovako is exposed to currency risk because the group's base currency is the EU R , while a portion of revenues and a large share of expenses are denominated in other currencies. The greatest currency risk is linked to the Swedish krona (SEK ) primarily because a large part of Ovako's production costs are in SEK. Appreciation of the Swedish krona by 1% in relation to the euro would have an estimated annualised negative impact on consolidated operating profit of E U R 1.9 million based on sales and purchase volumes for 2012.
Most of Ovako group's sales are in euro. The currency split for sales in 2012 was approximately as follows: 62 % EU R, 28 % SE K and 10 % other currencies (mainly GBP and USD). The underlying purchase prices o f key raw materials, such as iron scrap and alloys, are set in global or European markets and the functional purchasing currency is thus USD or EUR, even if the actual purchase price may be billed in local currency. Accordingly, these purchases function as de facto hedges of inflows in EU R and USD.
The group's currency risk is managed by group treasury, which is re sponsible for monitoring and managing total currency risk for the group.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that changes in market rates will have adverse impact on consolidated earnings. The group's finance policy is to hedge at least two-thirds of the fixed rate term on the total debt portfolio over a three-year period. At 31 December 2012, the group had two inter est rate swaps with a total value of EU R 270 million at fixed rates, which will mature in 2013 (EU R 120m) and 2014 (EU R 150m). Assuming the loan debt is unchanged at the end of the year, a change in market interest rates of 100 basis points (1 percentage point) would impact pre-tax earn ings by EU R 0.0 million.
Electricity price risk
Electricity price risk refers to the risk that changes in market prices for electricity will have an adverse impact on consolidated earnings.
The group's normal annual consumption of electricity is approximately 1 TW h. To mitigate price volatility that causes fluctuations in cash flow and earnings, hedging measures are used by which portions of the vari able price of electricity are transferred to a fixed price. At year-end 2012, anticipated future electricity consumption was hedged according to the following contracts: 62 % for 2013,44 % for 2014 and 23 % for 2015. A rise of 10 % in the price o f electricity compared to the spot price at 31 December 2012 would have a positive impact on Ovako's compre hensive income, before tax, of approximately E U R 0.3 million, taking into account the hedging contracts that exist and with the same annual consumption as in 2012.
The group uses hedge accounting for electricity derivatives since these have been designated as cash flow hedges. Find more details on these derivatives in Note 13.

CONSOLIDATED FiNANCiAL STATEMENTS

n o te 23. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CoNT.

liquidity and refinancing risk Liquidity and refinancing risk is the risk of the group having insuffi cient access to the funds necessary to meet its obligations.
The group's financing is achieved through the financing agreement signed in 2010, as further described in Note 21. As described in Note 21, there are loan covenants, which may pose a risk to the company's access to capital. Total credit utilised at 31 December amounted to EU R 267.1 (296.0) million. O f the revolving credit facility totalling EU R 75.0 million, E U R 3.8 million was utilised in the form of issued bank guarantees, which means the unutilised facility amounts to EU R 71.2 (75.0) million.

Surplus liquidity is used primarily to repay debt. I f this is impossible, the surplus funds are invested within internally defined limits with banks that are counterparties to the group's credit agreements.
The maturity structure of debt over future years is presented in Note 21. The table below shows contractual undiscounted payments including amortisation, interest and interest-rate derivatives linked to the financing agreement.
The calculation assumes that the IBO R interest rate is unchanged from the rate at 31 December 2012. Cash flows for derivatives are stated net.

Credit and counterparty risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations. The group is exposed to credit and counterparty risk against financial counterparties when funds are deposited, when positive cash balances are maintained with banks and when financial derivatives are acquired. These risks are minimised by contracting only with financially stable banks or other counterparties.
Beyond the foregoing, credit risks are associated with trade receivables. Exposure to credit risk in trade receivables is managed according to the principles set out in the Credit Management Rules and Guidelines established by group management. These rules require, among else, that 99% of annual sales must be covered by credit insurance. A credit limit is established for each customer, which is set by the company's insurance company or internal credit control. Credit risk in trade receivables is man aged primarily through credit risk insurance. Credit risk is also reduced through bank guarantees, advance and cash payment requirements and letters of credit. At year-end, approximately 95% of Ovako's outstanding trade receivables were covered by credit insurance. The five largest custom ers (groups including subsidiaries) account for approximately 30% of consolidated sales and trade receivables.

INDEPENDENT AUDiTOR'S REPORT

Independent auditor's report
To the annual general meeting of shareholders in ovako Group AB, org. nr 556813-5361

Report on the annual accounts and consolidated financialstatements We have audited the accompanying annual accounts and consolidated financial statements of Ovako Group A B for the financial year ending 31 December 2012. The formal annual accounts and consolidated financial statements are included on pages 23-55 of the printed version of this document.
The responsibility o f the Board o f Directors and the CEO for the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements The Board of Directors and the C E O are responsible for the prepara tion and fair presentation of the annual accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the E U and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors and the C E O determine are necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
The auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We have conducted the audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing practices in Sweden. These standards require us to comply with standards of professional ethic and that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves obtaining audit evidence by means ofvarious proce dures about the amounts and other disclosures in the annual accounts and the consolidated financial statements. The auditor selects which procedures to perform, in part based on assessment of the risk of material misstatement in the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error. In the course o f this risk assessment, the auditor considers the components of internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropri ate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness o f the accounting policies applied and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors and the C EO , as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the annual accounts and the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate as a basis for our audit opinion.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and provide a fair presenta tion, in all material respects, of the financial position of the group at 31 December 2012 and of its financial results and cash flows, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory Board of Directors' Report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and the consoli dated financial statements.
We therefore recommend that the annual meeting of shareholders adopt the income statements and balance sheets for the parent company and the group.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements, we have also examined the proposed disposition of the com pany's profit or loss and the administration of the Board o f Directors and the C E O of Ovako Group AB for the financial year ending 31 December 2012.
Responsibility o f the Board o f Directors and the CEO The Board o f Directors is responsible for preparing the proposed disposi tion of the company's profit or loss, and it is the Board of Directors and the C E O that are responsible for management of the company under the Swedish Companies Act.
The auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to an express an opinion with reasonable assurance on the proposed disposition of the company's profit or loss and the man agement of the company, based on our audit. We have conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.
As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors' proposed dis position of the company's profit or loss, we have examined whether the proposal is in conformity with the Companies Act.
As a basis for our opinion concerning discharge from liability, in addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements, we have examined significant decisions, actions taken and circumstances of the company in order to be able to determine whether any director or the C E O are liable to the company. We have also exam ined whether any director or the C E O have, in any other way, acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles ofAssociation.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate as a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and provide a fair presentation, in all material respects, of the financial position of the parent company at 31 December 2012 and o f its financial results and cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.

Opinion We recommend that the annual meeting o f shareholders resolve to allocate profit as proposed in the Board of Directors'report and discharge the directors and the C E O from liability for the financial year.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CORPORATE INFORMATION Triako Midco AB (registration number 556813-5361) is owned by Triako Holdco AB (registration number 556813-5379). Triako Holdco AB is the group's Swedish parent company and was founded by the pri vate equity firm Triton on 1 July 2010 in Stockholm. Triako Holdco AB is wholly owned by Oven Luxco Sarl, Luxembourg. The Triton III fund directly and indirectly controls 83.14% of equity in the Ovako group.
The registered address of both Triako Holdco AB and Triako Midco AB is Box 5013, 194 61 Upplands Vsby, Sweden. Consolidated finan cial statements are also prepared for Triako Holdco AB.
The object of the company's business is to own and manage shares in other companies that develop, manufacture and sell steel products and to engage in related business.
On 2 July 2010, Triako Holdco AB formed two holding companies, Triako Midco AB and Triako AB (which was subsequently renamed Ovako AB). On 29 September 2010, Ovako AB acquired all shares in the Swedish companies Ovako Bar AB, Ovako Bright Bar AB, Ovako Hofors A B and Ovako Tube & Ring A B from Ovako Holdings AB (owned by Ovako Holdings BV/the Pampus family in Germany). On 7 July 2010, Ovako AB formed a holding company,Triako Finco AB, which on 20 August 2010 formed a Finnish holding company,Triako Finco Oy, which was subsequently renamed Ovako Finland Oy. Ovako Finland Oy acquired all shares in Ovako Imatra Oy AB (formerly Ovako Bar Oy AB) from Ovako Holdings AB on 29 September 2010. The cost of all shares in the Ovako companies was EU R 131 million.
The aforementioned companies and subsidiaries thereof comprise the Ovako group. Disclosures about all subsidiaries are provided in Note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Ovako transaction was finalised on 29 September 2010, at which point Triako Holdco AB obtained control over the acquired companies. The comparative figures for 2010 in the consolidated income statement reflect net profit for Triako Midco AB for 2 July - 31 December 2010 and for its acquired subsidiaries for 29 September - 31 December 2010.
Previously the Swedish krona, the functional currency of the parent was changed to the euro (EUR) effective 1January 2011. The euro is the presentation currency for the group. Assets and liabilities are measured on a historical cost basis except for items measured under IFR Ss at fair value, as explained in the accounting policies outlined below.
Effective 1 January 2011, all holding companies and larger Swedish subsidiaries of the group have adopted the euro as the functional curren cy.The change was forward-looking. The majority of sales are transacted in euro and the prices of underlying purchases of materials, such as scrap and alloys, are set in global or European markets. The real functional cur rency of such raw materials is thus USD or EUR, even though the actual price may be determined in local currency. These purchases thus hedge inflows in EU R and USD. In addition, the acquisition and the credit facilities established in 2010 were also denominated in euro, whichjusti fies the change to euro as the functional currency because cash outflows from financing function as hedges of expected net cash inflows in euro. The change to euro as functional currency also ameliorates the effect of finance income and costs on profit and equity arising from movements in the SE K /E U R exchange rate.
On 8 May 2012, the Board of Directors authorised publication of the annual report and consolidated financial statements for the financial year ending 31 December 2011. The consolidated and parent company financial statements will be presented to the annual general meeting for adoption on 15 May 2012.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Consolidated financial statements Basis o f preparation The consolidated financial statements for the 2011 financial year have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) for the financial year beginning 1 January 2011. Recommendation RFR 1 Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board has also been applied.
The financial statements are presented in euro (EUR) rounded to the nearest million. All individual figures (including subtotals and totals) are rounded to the nearest million. From the presentation perspective, individual figures may therefore precisely reflect their sum totals.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis unless otherwise explained in the accounting policies.
Uncertainty related to judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the financial statements requires management to makejudgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as other disclosures.
Estimates and related assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors believed to represent the best available parameters for measuring assets and liabilities. Actual outcomes may differ from the estimates. The estimates and judgements discussed in this section are those judged most important to understanding the group's financial statements.
Impairment testing
The carrying amounts of the group's non-current assets are tested to determine whether there is any indication of impairment loss when events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount will not be recovered. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is measured as the discounted present value of future cash flows expected to arise from the asset or the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. No indications of impairment in the group's non-current assets were found during the financial year. There is no goodwill recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
Pension benefit assumptions
Pension benefits obligations are based on actuarial valuations. A discount rate is used to measure the present value of the defined benefit obligation. The rate should correspond to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds or, if no deep market in corporate bonds exists, govern ment bonds (see also `Employee benefits'concerning determination of the discount rate for Swedish pension benefits obligations). These assumptions are assessed at least once a year for all plans in each country. Other assumptions, which may relate to demographic factors such as age of retirement, mortality rates and employee turnover, are reviewed less frequently and usually based on public statistics in each country.
Valuation o f inventories
Valuations o f inventories contain estimates o f net realisable value and assumptions pertaining to cost distribution and normal capacity, which may affect the carrying amount.
Business combinations Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost is calculated as the sum of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition-date fair value and the value of any non-control ling influence in the acquiree, either at fair value or proportionate share of identifiable net assets in the acquiree. Acquisition and transaction costs are recognised as they arise as either an operating expense or a finance expense, depending on the nature of the expense. See Note 2 Business combinations for details of acquisitions during the reporting period.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company Triako Midco AB and all companies in which the parent directly or indirectly holds more than 50% ofvoting rights or, on another basis, directly or indirectly exerts controlling influence.
Equity holdings in subsidiaries have been eliminated using the acqui sition method. The financial statements of group companies are incor porated in the consolidated financial statements as of the date the group obtains control over the acquiree until such control ceases. Intra-group transactions, receivables, liabilities, unrealised gains and intra-group dividends are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are eliminated only to the extent there is no evidence of impairment loss.
Associates are companies in which the Ovako group holds more than 20% ofvoting rights or over which the group otherwise has significant but not controlling influence. At the end of the year, Ovako had one as sociate in which the equity interest exceeded 20%. Investments in associ ates are accounted for using the equity method. The share of the profits or losses of associates is recognised in profit or loss and the share of total equity constitutes the value of the investment in the balance sheet.

Foreign currency translation

Transactions are recorded in the functional currency of the respective unit. The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment (determined e.g. through the prices of its goods and ser vices) in which group companies operate.
Transactions in foreign currencies (other than the functional cur rency) are translated at the exchange rate in effect at transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate. Exchange gains and losses arising upon translation are recognised in profit and loss. Exchange gains and losses related to trade receivables or trade payables are treated as adjustments to the respective item and included in operating profit or loss. Exchange differences related to financing are included in finance income and expense. Non-monetary items are translated to the rate in effect at transaction date.
In the consolidated financial statements, the income statements of foreign subsidiaries have been translated to EU R at the average rate for the reporting period. The balance sheets of subsidiaries have been trans lated to EU R at the closing rate. Foreign currency translation differences arising from translations of income statements and balance sheets are recognised in a foreign currency translation reserve, which is a separate component of equity. Foreign currency translation differences arising from the translation of net investments in foreign subsidiaries are also transferred to the translation reserve via other comprehensive income.
The exchange rates used in the consolidated financial statements for translations of the balance sheets and income statements of subsidiaries are:

Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost adjusted for cumulative depreciation and impairment, if any. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the asset are capitalised as a component of cost if the time required to bring the asset to working condition for its intended use or sale is material. In accordance with Ovako's definitions, borrowing costs are capitalised for capital expenditures amounting to at least EU R 20 million and which are expected to take at least 12 months to complete. There were no capital expenditures in 2011 (2010: none) for which borrowing costs were capitalised.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes expenditures for materials, direct payroll costs and a reasonable share of production-

related overheads. To the extent assets consist of components with material differences in useful lives, they are depreciated separately using `component depreciation'. Expenditures for major repairs and maintenance are included in the carrying amount of the asset and depreciated over the remaining useful life to the extent they increase the economic benefit derived from the asset. Customary expenditures for repairs and maintenance are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset to an estimated residual value.

Estimated useful lives: Buildings Process machinery and equipment Computers Other machinery and equipment

10-40 years 15-20 years 3-5 years 3-10 years

Residual values and estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each reporting date. If they differ materially from earlier estimates, they are adjusted to the new estimate.
Capital gains or losses arising from the disposal of items of prop erty, plant and equipment are recognised in other operating income or expense.

Government grants and comparable assistance Government grants and comparable assistance are recognised in profit and loss in the period in which the underlying expenses are incurred. The group received no significant government grants during the reporting period.
Group companies that are parties to the EU emission trading scheme have been allotted emissions credits with no performance requirements attached.

Intangible assets Ovako's intangible assets comprise mainly software, licences, trademarks and comparable rights. These intangible assets are recognised in the bal ance sheet at cost less cumulative amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset to an estimated residual value.
The estimated useful life of intangible assets is normally between 5 and 10 years.
Emission credits have not been capitalised in the balance sheet because actual emissions do not exceed the emission credits allotted with no performance requirements attached.

Research and development costs Research costs are recognised in profit and loss as incurred. The group has no development costs that meet the criteria for capitalisation under IAS 38 Intangible Assets.

Impairment of assets Annually on the reporting date, the carrying amount of consolidated goodwill, if any, is assessed and an impairment loss recognised if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. At 31 December 2011, no consolidated goodwill (2010: none) had been recognised in the balance sheet.
The group's other non-current assets are assessed annually to deter mine whether there any indications o f impairment. If such indications are found, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. The recovery value is the higher o f net realisable value and value in use.
Value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to arise for an asset or cash generating unit containing goodwill. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or cash generat ing unit exceeds the recoverable amount. Within the Ovako group, the recoverable amount is based on value in use and calculated at the cash generating unit level or the individual asset level when it is possible to identify separate cash flows for the asset.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Leases Determination of whether an agreement is, or contains, a lease depends upon the substance of the agreement when it is made; whether perfor mance of the contract depends on the use of a specific asset or assets or if the agreement conveys a right to control the asset, even if the right is not explicitly laid out in the agreement.
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers to the lessee substantially all risks and rewards incident to ownership of the leased property. Finance leases are initially recognised in the balance sheet at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Assets held under finance leases are depreci ated over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the asset.
Leases in which the lessor substantially retains all risks and rewards incident to ownership are classified as operating leases. Lease payments for operating leases are recognised as an expense in profit and loss over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, where cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The weighted average cost method is used when it provides a more reliable picture of certain types of inventory items. The cost of finished goods and work in prog ress includes the cost o f materials, direct labour, other direct costs and an allocation of allocatable indirect costs based on normal capacity. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs for completion and costs to sell.
Employee benefits - pensions Allocations to defined contribution plans are recognised as an ex pense in profit and loss in the year to which they relate.
The Projected Unit Credit Method is applied to calculate allocations to defined benefit plans and the benefit is attributable to years o f service. Pension benefits expenses are allocated to years of service according to actuarial valuations prepared by authorised actuaries. The amount recognised as the defined benefit liability or asset comprises the sum of the following: the present value of the defined benefit obligation, fair value of assets under management, past service costs and actuarial gains and losses. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of defined benefit obligations is the yield on high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds with a similar maturity as the obligation, except for Sweden. For Sweden, which accounts for approximately 89 percent of the group's pension benefits obligations, the historical practice has been to refer to long-term nominal government bonds to determine the discount rate based on the presumption that no deep market existed for first-class corporate bonds. The market for secured housing bonds, which has grown steadily in recent years, is comprised of bonds issued by housing institutes mainly owned by Swedish banks, which are secured through the `collateral pool',which may be made up of mortgage loans and government loans and encompass a large number of bonds rated AA or higher by major credit rating institutes. As a consequence of this de velopment, Ovako management hasjudged as of 2011, in line with many other employers in Sweden, that the secured housing bonds market is de facto a deep corporate bond market as defined in IAS 19 paragraph 78 and as such is a suitable reference for determining the discount rate.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Share-based payments The group currently has no share-based incentive programmes.
Provisions A provision is recognised when the group has a present legal or construc tive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be estimated reliably. The expected future cash flow is dis counted to calculate provisions when the time value of money is material.

A provision for restructuring will be recognised only if the group has adopted a detailed formal plan and the restructuring has either com menced or been publicly announced.
Income taxes The group's recognised tax expense comprises tax on the taxable income of group companies for the period and adjustments, if any, for taxes for previous periods and changes in deferred tax. Current income taxes are calculated based on the tax rates and tax rules in effect in each country.
Deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are calculated using the balance sheet method based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and fiscal amounts of assets and liabilities. The most significant temporary differences arise from non-current assets, unutilised loss carryforwards, unrealised intra-group gains and provisions. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are determined at the rates in effect for the period when the asset is realised or the liability paid based on tax rates (and legislation) enacted or announced at the reporting date. The effects of deferred tax assets and tax liabilities recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised according to the same principles.
Revenue recognition Revenue from goods sold is recognised when the seller has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards o f ownership o f the goods. Revenue is normally recognised at date of delivery in accordance with applicable terms of carriage. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration that has been or will be received, less VAT,discounts and returns.
Interest, dividends and royalties are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits of the transaction will flow to the enterprise and the amount o f revenue can be measured reliably.
Financial assets Financial assets have been classified at fair value through profit and loss, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. Initial classification of a financial asset is based on the nature and purpose of the asset.
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss are rec ognised using trade date accounting. Realised and unrealised gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognised in comprehen sive income for the year in the period in which they arise.
Loan receivables and trade receivables
Loan receivables and trade receivables include assets that arise upon transfers o f cash and cash equivalents, goods or services to a debtor. Receivables are reported as current or non-current depending on the maturity date. Loans issued by the group are recognised at cost. An impairment loss on a loan or receivable is recognised when the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.

F-82

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets include publicly quoted shares, unquoted shares and fixed-income investments. Purchases and sales are recognised at trade date and measured at fair value. Financial assets traded on a public marketplace are measured at fair value based on the quoted market price on the reporting date. Certain unquoted equity instruments for which fair value cannot be reliably determined are measured at cost less any impairment loss. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised, net of tax, through other com prehensive income as a change in the fair value reserve in equity. The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets until the asset is sold or otherwise disposed of.
Financial liabilities Interest-bearing liabilities are recognised at amortised cost based on the effective interest rate method. Financial liabilities are included in current and non-current liabilities and may be interest-bearing or non interest-bearing.
Borrowing costs, etc. Loan arrangement costs are capitalised over the term o f the loan and recognised as prepayments that reduce interest-bearing-liabilities. Charges paid for loan commitments are reported as transaction costs for borrowing to the extent it is probable that all or part of the credit limit will be utilised. In such cases, the charge is reported when the credit limit is utilised. When there is no evidence that it is probable that all or part of the credit limit will be utilised, the charge is reported as a prepayment for financial services and allocated over the maturity of the relevant loan commitment.
Derivatives Financial derivatives are classified either as hedging instruments or instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss. Deriva tive instruments are initially measured at cost and subsequent to initial recognition are measured at fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of electricity forwards and interest rate swaps is based on observable market data at the reporting date. Ovako had no foreign currency forwards in the balance sheet at the end of the year.
The group applies hedge accounting for forward contracts related to electricity prices and interest rate swaps that meet the criteria defined in IAS 39. Changes in the value of hedging instruments that are part of an effective cash flow hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income and shown in the hedge reserve in equity, while hedge ineffectiveness is recognised immediately in profit and loss. The cumulative change in value of such derivatives is transferred to net profit or loss in the same period as the hedged item affects profit and loss.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised at the original amount billed less any impairment losses. Impairment is assessed based on the credit risk of each item on reporting date.
Cash and bank balances Cash and bank balances include liquid bank balances and cash in hand as well as short-term bank deposits with a remaining maturity from acquisition date of three months or less.

New and revised standards and interpretations for 2011 The accounting policies applied are unchanged from previous years except for the following new and revised IFRS and IFRIC interpreta tions mandatorily effective as of 1January 2011:
 IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures (amendment)
 IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation - Classification of Rights Issues (amendment)
 IFR IC 14 Prepayments of Minimum Funding Requirement (amendment)
 IFR IC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments
 Improvements to IFR Ss adopted by the EU, February 2011
Application of these standards and interpretations has had no effect on consolidated accounting policies, financial position or earnings. Minor disclosures have been added based on the improvements to IFRS.
issued amendments to standards not yet mandatorily effective The new standards and interpretations mandatorily effective for the calendar year 2012 or later which are expected to have impact on the consolidated financial statements are presented below. The group will apply these when they become mandatorily effective and have been adopted by the European Commission
IAS 1 Presentation o f other comprehensive income (amendment) The amendment changes how groups o f items are presented in other comprehensive income. Items that are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently and items that will not be reclassified must be presented separately. The proposal changes only the presentation of other comprehensive income, not the actual content. IAS 1 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and measurement This standard is part of a major recast of the current standard IAS 39. The standard deals with classification and measurement of financial assets as defined in IAS 39. IFRS 9 contains two primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost and fair value. The stan dard is mandatorily effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The standard will be supplemented with rules on impair ments and hedge accounting, among else. Implementation of IFRS 9 will affect classification and measurement of the group's financial assets. These effects will be explained when the new policies are implemented. The standard has not yet been adopted for application within the EU.
IFRS 12 Disclosures o f interest in other entities IFRS 12 replaces IAS 27 in respect of disclosures under IAS 31 and IAS 28. IFRS 12 specifies minimum disclosures for entities that have interests in subsidiaries, associates,joint arrangements and unconsoli dated structured entities. The aim of these disclosures is to help users of financial statements understand the potential impact of the interests on the financial statements and the nature of and risks associated with interests in other entities. This may affect the disclosures provided in the consolidated financial statements. IFRS 12 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement IFRS 13 establishes a framework for measuring fair value by introduc ing guidelines for how it should be determined for items for which other IFRSs require or permit fair value measurement. The group is currently assessing the extent to which this may affect the group's financial posi tion and results. IFRS 13 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.

NOTE 1. NET SALES BY GEOGRAPHICAL TERRITORY
The group is geographically divided into six sales territories as shown on the following table. The group had no revenues prior to acquisition of the Ovako companies on 29 September 2010. Accordingly, the disclosures in the table for 2010
refer only to the period thereafter. Segment reporting in accordance with IFR S 8 is not provided because this is not mandatory for entities whose shares are not publicly traded. The
presentation below was therefore prepared as required under the Swed ish Annual Accounts Act.

NOTE 2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
There were no acquisitions of businesses in 2011. Triako Midco AB was formed 2 July 2010 in Stockholm, Sweden. The
company is owned byTriako Holdco AB (registration number 556813 5379).
On 2 July 2010, Triako Holdco AB formed two holding companies, Triako Midco AB and Triako AB (which was subsequently renamed Ovako AB). On 29 September 2010, Ovako AB acquired all shares in the Swedish companies Ovako Bar AB, Ovako Bright Bar AB, Ovako Hofors AB and Ovako Tube & Ring AB from Ovako Holdings AB (owned by Ovako Holdings BV/the Pampus family in Germany). On 7 July 2010, Ovako AB formed a holding company,Triako Finco AB, which on 20 August 2010 formed a Finnish holding company,Triako Finco Oy, which was subsequently renamed Ovako Finland Oy. Ovako Finland Oy acquired all shares in Ovako Imatra Oy AB (formerly Ovako Bar Oy A B) from Ovako Holdings AB on 29 September 2010. The total acquisition price was E U R 131 million. Production in the acquired companies includes low-alloy steel and carbon steel bars, tubes, rings and pre-components for industries whose primary business is heavy vehicles, cars and mechanical engineering.
In accordance with the IFRS on business combinations, the value of acquired businesses has been measured at fair value at 29 September 2010. Fair value adjustments were subsequently made to the value of inventories and property, plant and equipment.
I f the company had been formed and the acquisitions had taken place on January 1, 2010, consolidated net sales would have been approximately EU R 861 million and operating profit (EBIT) would have been EU R 67 million, assuming the same acquisition price and the same fair value adjustments at 1January 2010.

There were 50,000 shares (2010: 50,000) outstanding in Triako Midco AB at 31 December 2011. At 1January 2011, the previous share capital of SEK 50,000 was restated in euro and share capital after that date amounts to EU R 5,547. The quotient value per share is EU R 0.11 (SEK 1). All shares are fully paid.
The following reserves are recognised in equity:
Foreign currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve comprises the exchange rate differences arising from translations of the financial statements of subsidiaries.
Cash flow hedge reserve The cash flow hedge reserve includes the effective portion of the total net change in fair value of cash flow hedge instruments against changes in electricity prices and fair value changes in interest rate swaps.
NOTE 22. PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The group has entered into a number of pension plans in accordance with local regulations and agreements.
In Sweden, which accounts for 89% of the group's pension liabilities, there are both defined contribution plans, for which pension payments are managed by insurance companies, and defined benefit plans, for which the group's pension obligations are secured in the Swedish PRI/ FPG system. Certain group companies have specific pension plans for key management personnel.
The plans of foreign subsidiaries are structured in accordance with local rules and customary practice.
Pension benefits in Finnish companies are secured by local insurance companies and a voluntary pension agreement covered by supplemental insurance. Pensions in Finland are mainly covered by the statutory T E L pension system. Some individual agreements may cover early retirement or disability. There are other long-term service benefits in some instances, such as compensation for long service.
The current pension system in the Netherlands is implemented within the Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds (industrial sector pension fund) `Stichting Pensioenfonds Metaal enTechniek'(Pension Fund for the Engineering, Mechanical and Electric Contracting Sector). These are defined benefit plans but are treated as defined contribution plans in the annual accounts because sufficient parameters are unavailable to perform defined benefit plan calculations under IAS 19.
Ovako has a pension and life assurance plan for its employees in the UK. The plan was created as a defined benefit plan, which had a deficit at 31 December. The plan was closed to new subscribers as of 31 December 2009.
Ovako North America Inc offers defined contribution plans open to all employees who have worked for the company for at least six months. The company also has a post-employment medical insurance plan for certain employees and former employees.
Employees in Germany are covered by public pension schemes. The president and two other key management personnel also have a supple mental, defined benefit plan. The majority of the defined benefit pension plan refers to supplemental insurance for former executives. The pension liability is insured.

Employees in Italy are covered by national pension schemes and the T R F severance pay system with no additional pension plans. The T R F liability is recognised as a defined benefit pension plan.
The French pension liability is covered by pensions under French law and collective agreements (A ARCO/AGIRC). Accordingly, the company does not have its own pension plan. Ovako Redon SAS has a defined benefit pension liability created for the IFC components of the mandatory pension (a retirement indemnity plan).
Pensions in Poland and Russia are covered by government pension schemes.
The group's cost for defined contribution plans amounted to EU R 8.4 (2.4) million in 2011.

The mortality assumptions for the Swedish pension plan were changed in 2011, which is the main cause of actuarial losses in 2011. Otherwise, it is changes in the discount rate that affect the group's liability for pensions and other post-employment benefits. A change in the discount rate of 0.25% in calculating the present value of benefits according to the Swedish pension plan increased the pension liability by EU R 2 million in 2011.

Term loan and revolving credit facility In conjunction with the change of ownership in 2010, Triako Midco AB and subsidiaries entered into a Senior Facilities Agreement (`SFA') totalling EU R 385 million.
The term loan is divided into two parts, Facility A at EU R 86 (100) million, which will be amortised for the first time in March 2013 and matures in September 2015; and Facility B at E U R 210 (210) million, which will be amortised in full upon maturity in September 2016. Voluntary amortisation is also paid, which amounted to EU R 14 million in 2011.
The loan agreement includes a revolving credit facility of EU R 75 (75) million which was unutilised at year-end. Total credit utilisation at 31 December was E U R 296 (310) million.

The interest rate for the SFA is the average annual IBO R plus lend ing margin.
Under the terms of the loan, the company must ensure compliance with financial covenants based on cash flow, interest coverage ratio, leverage ratio, capital expenditures, minimum EBITD A and minimum cash. The company was in compliance with all covenants at the reporting date.
All shares in large group subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral for the Senior Facilities. In addition, the subsidiaries have issued prop erty mortgages and floating charges. See also Note 34.
Arrangement fees were paid in conjunction with the initial draw down of the first SFA loan. Arrangement costs are amortised over the term of the loan and recognised as prepayments that reduce interest bearing-liabilities.

NOTE 26. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Financial risk management Financial risk management is governed by the group finance policy as ad opted by the Board of Directors. The purpose of the policy is to establish general financial targets, allocation of responsibilities and threshold limits for financial risks, and to describe actions that can be taken to mitigate these financial risks within the framework of strategic and operational financial risk management of the Ovako group and its business units.
Ovako's operations give rise to a number of financial risks including market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Market risk is the risk that market changes, such as adverse changes in interest rates and exchange rates will affect the group's earnings and/or financial position.
The main objective ofgroup financial risk management is to mitigate the adverse impacts of financial risks on consolidated earnings, cash flows and equity and to assure adequate liquidity.
The Ovako group shall not engage in hedging transactions or financial transactions that are unrelated to operating activities or may otherwise be regarded as inappropriate management of the group's financial exposure. Purely speculative financial transactions are not permitted.
The majority of the group's financial transactions and financial risk management are managed centrally through Group Treasury in compli ance with the risk management rules and guidelines established by the Board of Directors in the finance policy.
Liquidity and refinancing risk Under the present capital structure, Ovako is a net borrower. Con sequently, refinancing risk arises in conjunction with the maturity of existing loans and the raising of new debt.
The group seeks to reduce liquidity and refinancing risk by keeping a balanced maturity profile for existing loans and available, unutilised credit facilities.
In connection with the transfer of ownership in September 2010, the group entered into a Senior Facilities Agreement for EU R 385 million, which will mature in September 2015 and September 2016. The SFA is subject to financial covenants which may entail a risk for the company's access to capital. Refer to Note 24 for further information.

At year-end 2011, the utilised portion ofloans under the SFA was EU R 296 (310) million. The maturity structure of debt over future years is presented in Note 24.
The liquidity buffer, defined as the sum of unutilised credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents should exceed EU R 15 million. At yearend, the liquidity buffer was E U R 108 (99) million.
To the extent surplus liquidity arises, it is used primarily to repay debt. I f this is impossible, the surplus funds are invested within internally defined limits with banks that are counterparties to the group's credit agreements.
Market risk - foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk of changes in exchange rates that ad versely affect the company's earnings, equity and competitiveness.
Ovako is exposed to currency risk because the group's base currency is the euro, which is also the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements as of 1January 2011, while a portion of revenues and a large share of expenses are denominated in other currencies. The great est currency risk is linked to the Swedish krona (SEK) primarily because a large part of Ovako's production costs are in SEK. Appreciation of the Swedish krona by 1% in relation to the euro would have an estimated annualised negative impact on consolidated operating profit of EU R 1.6 million based on sales for 2011.
More than halfthe Ovako group's sales are in euro. The currency split for sales in 2011 was roughly as follows: 62% E UR, 28% SEK, 10% other currencies (mainly GBP and USD). The underlying purchase prices of key raw materials, such as iron scrap and alloys, are set in a global or European market and the functional purchasing currency is thus USD or EUR, even if the actual purchase price may be billed in local currency. Accordingly, these purchases function as de facto hedges of inflows in EU R and USD.
The group's currency risk is managed by Group Treasury, which is re sponsible for monitoring and managing total currency risk for the group. Currency risk is treated as translation exposure or transaction exposure.
Translation exposure is defined as the exposure arising from transla tion of currencies in subsidiaries' financial statements to the group's presentation currency. Translations that cause fluctuations in consoli dated equity comprise investments in subsidiaries whose functional currency is not EUR.
Effective 2011, all major Swedish subsidiaries are using the euro as the functional currency for accounting and presentation, which has signifi cantly reduced translation exposure. In order to minimise the translation effect on the net debt/equity ratio, the company also aims to mitigate currency risk by raising loans in the base currency of each business unit.
Transaction exposure affects profit and loss for the year when sales and purchases are denominated and settled in different currencies, and consists of cash flows from business transactions in currencies other than the group's base currency.
The group's borrowings are denominated in euro and are intended to act as hedges against anticipated operating inflows in euro. Other currency flows that arise in connection with purchases and sales are short-term in nature and normally not hedged.
Ovako group management may decide from time to time to hedge contracted net exposure from sales in currencies other than the base or trading currency to secure margins.
The group had no currency derivatives at year-end 2011.

Market risk - interest rate risk Interest rate risk refers to the risk that changes in market rates will have adverse impact on consolidated net financial income.
The group's consolidated interest rate exposure is managed by Group Treasury.Total external loan debt at year-end was EU R 296 (310) million.
The group's finance policy is to hedge at least 2/3 of the fixed rate term on the total debt portfolio over a three-year period. At 31 December 2011, the group had two interest rate swaps with a total value of EU R 270 million at fixed rates, which will mature in 2013 (EUR 120m) and 2014 (EUR 150m).
Assuming the loan debt is unchanged at the end of the year, a change in market interest rates of 100 points (1 percent) would impact net financial income by EU R 0.3 million.
Credit and counterparty risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations.
The group is exposed to credit and counterparty risk against financial counterparties when funds are deposited, when positive cash balances are maintained with banks and when financial derivatives are acquired. These risks are minimised by contracting only with financially stable banks or other counterparties.
Beyond the foregoing, credit risks are associated with trade receiv ables. Exposure to credit risk in trade receivables is managed according to the principles set out in the Credit Management Rules and Guidelines established by group management. These rules require, among else, that 99% of annual sales must be covered by credit insurance.
A credit limit is established for each customer, which is set by the company's insurance company or internal credit control. Credit risk in trade receivables is managed primarily through credit risk insurance. Credit risk is also reduced through bank guarantees, advance and cash payment requirements and letters of credit.
At year-end, approximately 95% of Ovako's outstanding trade receiv ables were covered by credit insurance.
The five largest customers (groups including subsidiaries) account for approximately 30% of consolidated sales and trade receivables. These include four corporate groups based in the Nordics and one inWestern Europe.

At 31 December, trade receivable ageing was as follows (EURm):

There were no material credit losses or allowances for anticipated credit losses in 2011. Other receivables, including VAT receivables, accruals and deferred income were not overdue at 31 December 2011 and there was no indication of impairment loss.

Capital management The company's capital management objective is to ensure that business units can be managed effectively so that operations generate good returns for shareholders. The capital structure is adapted to ensure competitive and adequate financing compared to other companies in the industry.
The consolidated equity ratio was 24% (23) at 31 December 2011 (2010).

NOTE 27. FAIR vALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LiABiLiTiES
27.1. Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortised cost In management's assessment, the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities substantially coincide with fair value as explained in Notes 15 and 16. In connection with determining the fair value of loan debt, management has found no reason to presume changes have oc curred in the interest margin that existed when the loans were raised.
27.2. Fair values of other financial instruments Measurement methods and assumptions applied to estimate fair value:
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is determined as fol lows:
- The fair value of financial assets and liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active, liquid markets is determined with reference to quoted market prices.
- The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) is determined using generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis that take figures from observable market transactions and the quoted market prices of compa rable instruments.

- The fair value of derivative instruments is estimated with refer ence to quoted market prices. When such parameters are unavailable, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instrument and alternative pricing models for comparable derivative instruments. Foreign currency hedges are esti mated using the quoted exchange rate and the yield curve from a quoted interest rate that matches the contract maturity date. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on a suitable yield curve from a listed stock exchange.
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments mea sured at fair value. Measurements are classified in a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs based on the lowest level of input significant to overall fair value.
Level 1: Fair value is determined based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Fair value is determined based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).
Level 3: Fair value is determined based on inputs for the asset or liabil ity that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

Independent auditor's report
To the annual general meeting of shareholders in Triako Midco AB, registration number 556813-5361

Report on the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements We have audited the accompanying annual accounts and consolidated financial statements ofTriako Midco AB for the financial year that began 1January 2011 and ended 31 December 2011. The formal annual accounts and consolidated financial statements are included on pages 20-52 o f this document.
The responsibility o f the Board o f Directors for the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the annual accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the E U and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated financial statements that are free from mate rial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
The auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We have conducted the audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing practices in Sweden. These standards require us to comply with standards of professional ethic and that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves obtaining audit evidence by means ofvarious procedures about the amounts and other disclosures in the annual accounts and the consolidated financial statements. The auditor selects which procedures to perform, in part based on assessment of the risk of material misstatement in the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error. In the course of this risk assessment, the auditor considers the components of internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies applied and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors, as well as evaluating the over all presentation of the annual accounts and the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate as a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and provide a fair presentation,

in all material respects, of the financial position of the parent company at 31 December 2011 and of its financial results and cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act; and that the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and provide a fair presentation, in all material respects, of the financial position of the group at 31 December 2011 and of its financial results and cash flows, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory Board of Directors'Report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and the consolidated financial statements.
We therefore recommend that the annual meeting of shareholders adopt the income statements, statements of comprehensive income and balance sheets for the parent company and the group.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements, we have also examined the proposed disposition of the company's profit or loss and the management of the company by the Board of Directors ofTriako Midco AB for the financial year ending 31 December 2011.
Responsibility of the Board of Directors The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the proposed dispo sition of the company's profit or loss and is responsible for management of the company under the Swedish Companies Act.
The auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to an express an opinion with reasonable assurance on the proposed disposition of the company's profit or loss and the management of the company, based on our audit. We have conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors'proposed disposition of the company's profit or loss, we have examined whether the proposal is in conformity with the Companies Act.
As a basis for our opinion concerning discharge from liability, in addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated financial statements, we have examined significant decisions, actions taken and circumstances of the company in order to be able to determine whether any director is liable to the company. We have also examined whether any director has, in any other way, acted in contravention of the Compa nies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate as a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion We recommend that the annual meeting of shareholders resolve to allocate profit as proposed in the Board of Directors'report and dis charge the directors from liability for the financial year.

Auditor's report
To the annual meeting o f the shareholders o f Ovako A B , corporate identity number 556813-5338

Report on the annual accounts
We have audited the annual accounts o f Ovako A B for the year 2013 01-01 - 2013-12-31.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director fo r the annual accounts
The Board o f Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation o f these annual accounts in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act, and for such internal control as the Board o f Directors and the Managing Director determine is necessary to enable the preparation o f annual accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these annual accounts based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the annual accounts. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment o f the risks o f material misstatement o f the annual accounts, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company' s preparation and fair presentation o f the annual accounts in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose o f expressing an opinion on the effectiveness o f the company' s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness o f accounting policies used and the reasonableness o f accounting estimates made by the Board o f Directors and the Managing Director, as well as evaluating the overall presentation o f the annual accounts.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.
Opinions
In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position o f Ovako A B as o f December 31, 2013 and o f its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts o f the annual accounts.
We therefore recommend that the annual meeting o f shareholders adopt the income statement and balance sheet.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
In addition to our audit o f the annual accounts, we have also audited the proposed appropriations o f the company' s profit or loss and the administration o f the Board o f Directors and the Managing Director o f Ovako A B for the year 2013-01-01 - 2013-12-31.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director
The Board o f Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations o f the company' s profit or loss, and the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for administration under the Companies Act.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion with reasonable assurance on the proposed appropriations o f the company' s profit or loss and on the administration based on our audit. We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.
A s a basis for our opinion on the Board o f Directors' proposed appropriations o f the company' s profit or loss, we examined whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.
A s a basis for our opinion concerning discharge from liability, in addition to our audit o f the annual accounts, we examined significant decisions, actions taken and circumstances o f the company in order to determine whether any member o f the Board o f Directors or the Managing Director is liable to the company. We also examined whether any member o f the Board o f Directors or the Managing Director has, in any other way, acted in contravention o f the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts A ct or the Articles of Association.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.
Opinions
We recommend to the annual meeting o f shareholders that the profit be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members o f the Board o f Directors and the Managing Director be discharged from liability for the financial year.
