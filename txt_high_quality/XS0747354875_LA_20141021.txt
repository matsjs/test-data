Upon the initial issuance o f the Notes, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Initial Guarantors.
The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer to repay a portion o f the Senior Loan Agreement and to pay costs and expenses incurred in connection with the offering as set forth in this offering memorandum under the caption "Use of Proceeds". Concurrently, the Issuer and the lenders under the Senior Loan Agreement will amend the terms o f the Senior Loan Agreement, as described in "Description o f Certain Indebtedness-- Series A Senior Loan Agreement" (such amended and restated agreement, the "Series A Senior Loan Agreement").
The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, o f which 871.5 million aggregate principal amount o f Notes will be issued in this offering. We may issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Series A Fixed Rate Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Series A Fixed Rate Notes (the "Additional Series A Fixed Rate Notes"), an unlimited principal amount of additional Series A Floating Rate Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Series A Floating Rate Notes (the "Additional Series A Floating Rate Notes" and, together with the Series A Fixed Rate Notes, the "Additional Series A Notes") and an unlimited principal amount o f additional Series B Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Series B Notes (the "Additional Series B Notes" and, together with the Additional Series A Notes, the "Additional Notes"). We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below under "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Indebtedness"). Except with respect to right o f payment and optional redemption, and as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Notes issued in this offering and, if issued, any Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this "Description o f the Notes", references to the "Notes" include the Notes and any Additional Notes that are actually issued.
The Indenture and the Guarantees thereunder will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees. Please see "Description of Certain Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement" for a description of the material terms o f the Intercreditor Agreement. Additionally, the terms o f the Indenture are important to understanding the rights of priority and payment between the Series A Notes and the Series B Notes. Please see "--Right of Payment".
This "Description of the Notes" is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents (as defined below). Since this description of the terms o f the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents are incorporated by reference.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture.
General
The Notes The Notes will, upon issuance:
· be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under "-- Security";
· rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness o f the Issuer that is not subordinated to the Notes (including the obligations of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Series A Senior Loan), provided the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility will be entitled to priority o f payment from the proceeds of any enforcement o f such Guarantee and the holders of the Series A Notes and indebtedness under the Series A Senior Loan will be entitled to priority of payment over the holders o f the Series B Notes from any such proceeds);
· rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future obligation o f the Issuer that is expressly subordinated to the Notes;
· be effectively subordinated to any existing or future secured Indebtedness or obligation (including obligations to trade creditors) o f the Issuer and its Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;
· be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness o f Subsidiaries o f the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes;
· mature on September 1, 2018, in the case o f the Series A Notes, and December 1, 2018, in the case o f the Series B Notes; and
· be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see "Book-Entry, Delivery and Form").
The Guarantees The Notes will be guaranteed, as of the Issue Date, by the Initial Guarantors. Any additional subsidiary of the Issuer that becomes a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility shall, subject to agreed security principles and to the extent legally possible, become a party to the Indenture and will Guarantee the Notes on a senior basis. Each entity that Guarantees the Notes subsequent to the Issue Date is referred to herein as a "Post-Completion Guarantor" and such entities are collectively referred to as the "Post-Completion Guarantors"; the Post-Completion Guarantors together with the Initial Guarantors are collectively referred to herein as the "Guarantors" and each is referred to as a "Guarantor".
Each Guarantee o f the Notes will, at the time a Guarantor grants such Guarantee: · be a general senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor, secured as set forth under "-- Security"; · rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated to such Guarantor's Guarantee (including the senior guarantee given in favor of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Series A Senior Loan and certain Hedging Obligations, provided the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility will be entitled to priority of payment from the proceeds of any enforcement of such Guarantee and the holders of the Series A Notes and indebtedness under the Series A Senior Loan will be entitled to priority of payment over the holders o f the Series B Notes from any such proceeds);
· rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future obligation o f that Guarantor that is expressly subordinated to the Notes (including the Guarantor's guarantee o f the Mezzanine Loan); and
139

· be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness o f that Guarantor that is secured with property or assets that do not secure that Guarantor's Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such Indebtedness.
The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes-- Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability". The validity and enforceability o f the Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability o f the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests".
Each of the Issuer and the Initial Guarantors shall, subject to agreed security principles, take such necessary actions, and the Issuer shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to take such necessary actions, so that as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event no later than the date on which the relevant Post-Completion Guarantor grants a guarantee in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, each Post-Completion Guarantor shall become a Guarantor o f the Notes by executing and delivering to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture.
Not all o f our Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. As of September 30, 2011, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and those entities we expect will become Guarantors held 84% of our consolidated assets. For the year ended December 31, 2010, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer's subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes generated 17% of our total net sales and had SEK343 million of our total liabilities. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, administration, winding up, reorganization or other insolvency event of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us.
Principal and Maturity The Issuer will issue 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Series A Fixed Rate Notes, 100.0 million in aggregate principal amount o f Series A Floating Rate Notes and 271.5 million in aggregate principal amount of Series B Notes on the Issue Date. The Series A Notes will mature on September 1, 2018 and the Series B Notes will mature on December 1, 2018. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of 100,000 and in integral multiples o f 1,000 in excess thereof.
Interest Interest on the Series A Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate o f 8.75% per annum. Interest on the Series A Fixed Rate Notes will:
· accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;
· be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1, commencing on September 1, 2012;
· be payable to the holder of record of such Series A Fixed Rate Notes on February 15 and August 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and
· be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised o f twelve 30-day months.
Interest on the Series B Notes will accrue at the rate of 8.75% per annum. Interest on the Series B Notes will:
· accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;
140

· be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1, commencing on June 1, 2012;
· be payable to the holder o f record o f such Series B Notes on the May 15 and November 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and
· be computed on the basis o f a 360-day year comprised o f twelve 30-day months.
Interest on the Series A Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the "Applicable Rate"), reset quarterly, equal to three-month EURIBOR plus 6.50%, as determined by the calculation agent (the "Calculation Agent"), which shall initially be Citibank N.A., London Branch. Interest on the Series A Floating Rate Notes will:
· accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;
· be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, commencing on June 1, 2012;
· be payable to the holder of record o f such Series A Floating Rate Notes on the February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and
· be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.
Set forth below is a summary of certain o f the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Series A Floating Rate Notes.
"Determination Date" with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period.
"EURIBOR" with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Telerate Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date. If Telerate Page 248 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank's offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each o f three major banks in London, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank's rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.
"euro-zone" means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.
"Interest Period" means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include June 1, 2012.
"Representative Amount" means the greater of (i) 1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.
141

"TARGET Settlement Day" means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.
"Telerate Page 248" means the display page so designated on Bridge's Telerate Service (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).
The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the "Interest Amount"). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each Series A Floating Rate Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth o f a percentage point, with five onemillionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655). The determination o f the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Series A Floating Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
The rights o f Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. ("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme ("Clearstream"). If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment o f the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result o f any such delay.
Methods o f Receiving Payments on the Notes
Principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Note registered in the name of or held by a nominee of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.
Principal, interest and premium, if any, on any certificated securities ("Definitive Registered Notes") will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for such purposes in the City o f London. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by check mailed to the person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See "--Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes".
Paying Agent and Registrarfor the Notes
The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes in the City of London. The Issuer will also undertake to maintain a Paying Agent in a European Union member state that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 regarding the taxation of savings income (the "Directive"), or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive. The initial Paying Agent will be Citibank N.A., London Branch (the "Principal Paying Agent").
The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the "Registrar") and a transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent") in the City of London. The initial Registrar will be Citigroup Global Markets Deutschland AG and the initial Transfer Agent will be Citibank N.A., London Branch. The Transfer Agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership o f Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer.
142

The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice o f any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Such notice of the change in a Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent may also be published on the official website o f the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules o f the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect o f the Notes.
Releases of the Guarantees The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate:
· upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) o f the Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture;
· upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture o f the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;
· upon defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in "--Defeasance" and "-- Satisfaction and Discharge";
· in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
· as described under "--Amendments and Waivers"; · as described in the first paragraph o f the covenant described below under "-- Certain
Covenants--Additional Guarantees"; or · as a result o f a transaction permitted by "--Merger and Consolidation--The Guarantors".
The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessaiy actions, including the granting o f releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each o f the releases set forth above shall be effected by Trustee without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee.
Transfer and Exchange The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as follows:
· Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "144A Global Notes"). The 144A Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the common depositary for the accounts o f Euroclear and Clearstream.
· Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "Regulation S Global Notes" and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the "Global Notes"). The Regulation S Global Note will, on the closing date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.
Ownership of interests in the Global Notes ("Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.
143

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under "Notice to Investors". In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.
Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the " 144A Book-Entry Interests") may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the "Regulation S Book-Entry Interests") denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.
Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to US persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under "Notice to Investors" and in accordance with any applicable securities law o f any other jurisdiction.
Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations o f 100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples o f 1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar o f instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under "Notice to Investors".
Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations o f 100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples o f 1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account o f the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes:
(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption o f the Notes;
(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;
(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or
144

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.
The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.
Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries Immediately after the issuance o f the Notes, all the Issuer's Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the circumstances described below under "--Certain Definitions--Unrestricted Subsidiary", the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any o f the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.
Security General The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral. Subject to certain Permitted Collateral Liens, the Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral, including, (i) on a first-priority basis, the Holders, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders under the Series A Senior Loan and the creditors under certain hedging obligations and, (ii) on a second-priority basis, the lenders under the Mezzanine Loan Agreement. The validity and enforceability of the Liens over the Collateral issued as of the Issue Date and over any additional Collateral established in the future as set out below, will be subject to the limitations described in "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability o f the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests".
On the Issue Date, the Collateral will include the following property and assets: (1) all issued shares of the Issuer, the Swedish Purchaser and the Targets; (2) all issued shares of the subsidiaries of the Targets organized in Sweden, Norway, Portugal and Spain, consisting of (a) Securitas Direct Sverige AB; (b) Aroundio Logistics AB; (c) Securitas Direct Services AB; (d) Securitas Direct AS (to be replaced with a pledge over a new private limited liability company to be incorporated in Norway following the incorporation of such company, which shall concurrently grant replacement security in the shares of Securitas Direct AS); (e) the Spanish Operating Company; and (f) Securitas Direct Portugal, Unipessoal Lda; (3) all issued equity certificates of the Issuer and the Swedish Purchaser; (4) the bank accounts o f the Spanish Target; (5) all loans to the Swedish Purchaser of the proceeds from the Senior Loan and the Mezzanine Loan; (6) the rights of the Purchasers under the Acquisition Agreement; (7) all intercompany receivables of the Swedish Purchaser from the Swedish Target and the Spanish Target and o f the Swedish Target from the Spanish Target and the Spanish Operating Company; (8) the rights of the Issuer under certain due diligence reports related to the Acquisition; and (9) certain other property and assets that have also been pledged to secure the Revolving Credit Facility and the Series A Senior Loan, which property and assets include, depending on the jurisdiction o f incorporation and the location o f assets o f the relevant security provider, (i) certain rights under insurance policies, (ii) bank accounts, (iii) certain receivables and intercompany loans and (iv) certain intellectual property rights.
(collectively, the "Issue Date Collateral").
Any additional security interests that are in the future pledged to secure obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture will also constitute Collateral. This includes security interests to be granted
145

on an equal and ratable first-priority basis pursuant to the terms o f the Revolving Credit Facility and the Series A Senior Loan and subject to certain agreed security principles (the "Post-Completion Collateral").
Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors shall take such necessary actions, and the Issuer shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to take such necessary actions, so that the Liens on the Collateral shall, subject to legal representations, agreed security principles and certain limitations, be fully effective with respect to the Issue Date Collateral, on or about the Issue Date. In certain situations, a Post-Completion Guarantor might not be able to provide a Guarantee or grant the Post-Completion Collateral to the Security Agent for the benefit o f the Holders. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes-- Certain Notes Guarantors will not initially guarantee the Notes and certain Collateral will not initially secure the Notes." Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under "--Impairment of Security Interest" and "--Liens", the Issuer is permitted to pledge the Collateral in connection with future issuances o f its Indebtedness, including any Additional Notes, or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, permitted under the Indenture and on terms consistent with the relative priority of such Indebtedness.
The proceeds from the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders o f the Notes. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period o f time, or at all. See "Risk Factors-- Risks Related to the Notes--The collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes".
Priority
The relative priority among (a) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the lenders under the Series A Senior Loan, (c) the counterparties under certain hedging obligations secured on the Collateral, (d) the lenders under the Mezzanine Loan Agreement and (e) the Trustee and the Holders of the Series A Notes and the Series B Notes with respect to the security interest in the Collateral that is created by the Security Documents and secures obligations under the Notes or the Guarantees and the Indenture (the "Security Interest") is established by the terms o f the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture, the Security Documents and the security documents relating to the Revolving Credit Facility, the Series A Senior Loan, such hedging obligations and the Mezzanine Loan Agreement, which provide, among other things, that:
(1) the obligations under the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Series A Senior Loan and certain hedging obligations are secured equally and ratably by a first-priority interest in the Collateral, provided that any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received from any enforcement of the security over any Collateral; and
(2) the obligations under the Mezzanine Loan Agreement will be secured by a second-priority interest in the Collateral (subject to certain exceptions).
The Priority Agreement will provide that any Series B Indebtedness (including the Series B Notes) shall rank below any Series A Indebtedness (including the Series A Notes and the Series A Senior Loan) in right of priority and payment. All amounts received by the Trustee from the realization or enforcement of all or any part o f the Collateral or the Notes Guarantees will be first applied towards the discharge o f any amounts owed under the Indenture to Holders of the Series A Notes and under the Series A Senior Loan, then applied towards the discharge of any such amounts owed to holders of any Series B Indebtedness (including the Series B Notes).
See "Description of Certain Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement", "Description of Certain Indebtedness-- Series A Senior Loan Agreement", "Description of Certain Indebtedness--Priority Agreement", "Description of Certain Indebtedness--Mezzanine Loan Agreement" and "--Right of Payment". In addition, in connection with the incurrence of certain Indebtedness that is permitted by the Indenture to be secured on the Collateral, the Issuer will enter into Additional Intercreditor Agreements in compliance with the Indenture on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement. See "-- Certain Covenants-- Impairment of Security Interest" and "--Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound".
146

Security Documents
Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer's and each o f the Guarantor's payment obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into among the relevant security provider and the Security Agent (and, with respect to the Spanish law Security Documents, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders under the Series A Senior Loan and the lenders under the Mezzanine Loan). When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit o f the Holders from time to time. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders under the Series A Senior Loan, the counterparties under certain hedging contracts and the lenders under the Mezzanine Loan in relation to the Security Interest in favor of such parties.
The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and o f the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by the Security Interest in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, please see the section entitled "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes". The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests".
The Security Documents will provide that the rights with respect to the Notes and the Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent. Since the Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders may only act through the Security Agent.
In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interest created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interest or the terms o f the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. Please see "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes".
Enforcement of Security Interest
The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interest and provide for the release of the Security Interest created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. These limitations are described under "Description of Certain Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement" and "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests". The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Series A Senior Loan Agreement and the Mezzanine Loan Agreement, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Series A Senior Loan Agreement and the Mezzanine Loan Agreement, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.
147

Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound
Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under "Certain Covenants-- Additional Intercreditor Agreements".
The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions o f the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) and to have authorized the Trustee to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
Release o f Liens
The Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to release the Security Interest in respect o f the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees under any one or more o f the following circumstances:
(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not a Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to "Certain Covenants-- Merger and Consolidation"), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under "Certain Covenants--Limitation on Sales o f Assets and Subsidiary Stock" or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiaiy provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer o f capital stock or o f accounts receivable to a Restricted Subsidiaiy (except to a Receivables Subsidiaiy) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale or disposal;
(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;
(3) as described under "--Amendments and Waivers";
(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in "--Defeasance" and "-- Satisfaction and Discharge";
(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiaiy in accordance with the applicable provisions o f the Indenture, the release o f the property and assets, and Capital Stock, o f such Unrestricted Subsidiary; or
(6) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.
In addition, the Security Interest created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under "Certain Covenants-- Impairment of Security Interest".
The Security Agent and the Trustee will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions o f the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent o f the Holders or any action on the part o f the Trustee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any release of Liens over (i) shares constituting Collateral o f an entity incorporated in Sweden or (ii) any assets or business constituting Collateral granted pursuant to a Security Document governed by Swedish law will be subject to the prior written consent of the Security Agent (such consent to be given on a case by case basis at the discretion of the Security Agent (acting reasonably)). The requirements of the foregoing sentence shall not apply in relation to any release of any Unperfected Swedish Law Security Interest; provided that no Event o f Default is continuing at the time o f such release or would result from the same.
Furthermore, pursuant to Swedish law requirements relating to the granting of security, the following additional restrictions will apply to assets subject to Swedish law security arrangements that are not Unperfected Swedish Law Security Interests: (i) the right to sell or otherwise dispose of the secured assets will be subject to the consent o f the Security Agent; (ii) the Issuer may not redeem the equity certificates
148

issued by it and Swedish Purchaser may only redeem the equity certificates issued by it to the extent payments are made to the Security Agent and applied in repayment o f the secured liabilities under the relevant Security Document; (iii) repayment o f the principal amount under intra-group loans may only be made to the extent payments are made to the Security Agent and applied in repayment of the secured liabilities under the relevant Security Document; and (iv), redemption of equity certificates (subject to the restriction set out in clause (ii) above) or payment of yield, dividends under any share security or principal amount (subject to the restrictions set out in clause (iii) above) or interest under intra-group loans will only be allowed provided that no enforcement event has occurred under the relevant Security Document and that no event of default would result from such payment.

Right of Payment
The Series B Notes (and any additional Series B Indebtedness) shall rank below the Series A Notes (and any additional Series A Indebtedness) in right of priority and payment. All amounts received by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders from the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the Collateral or the Guarantees o f the Notes will be first applied towards the discharge of any amounts owed under the Indenture to Holders o f the Series A Notes (and any additional Series A Indebtedness), then applied towards the discharge of any such amounts owed to Holders o f the Series B Notes (and any additional Series B Indebtedness).

(2) the Issuer is permitted to make a Restricted Payment (defined below) in such Series B Redemption Amount pursuant to the first paragraph or clauses (1), (2), (4)(a), (4)(b), (11), (13) or (18) o f the third paragraph o f the covenant described under "Certain Covenants--Limitation on Restricted Payments";provided, however, that any such redemption or payment shall be considered a "Restricted Payment" for the purposes of the first and third paragraphs, as applicable, of such covenant (and any such redemption o f such Series B Redemption Amount would be considered a redemption of Subordinated Indebtedness and any Series A Indebtedness or Series B Indebtedness Incurred to Refinance Indebtedness under the Series B Notes would be considered Refinancing Indebtedness of Subordinated Indebtedness for the purposes of such covenant); or

Any redemption or notice under clause (3) above may, in the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent.
General
We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.
Notice o f redemption will be provided as set forth under "Selection and Notice" below.
152

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules o f the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.
If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.
In connection with any redemption o f Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any such redemption may, at the Issuer's discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent.
Sinking Fund The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
Redemption at Maturity On September 1, 2018, the Issuer will redeem the Series A Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased and canceled at 100% o f their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right o f Holders o f record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).
On December 1,2018, the Issuer will redeem the Series B Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased and canceled at 100% o f their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right o f Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).
Selection and Notice If less than all of the Notes is to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the Registrar will select Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, and in compliance with the requirements o f Euroclear or Clearstream, or if the Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribes no method o f selection, on apro rata basis or by use of a pool factor; provided, however, that no Note of 100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of 1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules o f the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) and in addition to such publication, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, mail such notice to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books o f the Registrar. Such notice o f redemption may also be published on the website o f the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion o f the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms o f the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the
153

date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.
Redemption for Taxation Reasons
The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% o f the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a "Tax Redemption Date") (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under "Withholding Taxes"), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otheiwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:
(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or
(2) any change in position regarding the official application, administration or written interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a "Change in Tax Law"),
the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) with respect to any Guarantee, as the case may be, is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay more than de minimis Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer or such Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable or, where such payment method would be reasonable under the circumstances, payment through another Guarantor or the Issuer). Such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the Issue Date. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under "Selection and Notice". Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice o f redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor (as defined below) would be obliged to make such payment o f Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer's Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be, has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept such Officer's Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence o f the satisfaction o f the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.
Withholding Taxes
All payments made by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors or a successor of the Issuer or Guarantor (a "Payor") on the Notes or any Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the official interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:
(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Guarantee is made, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or
(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a "Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction"),
will at any time be required from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor of the Paying Agent with respect to any Note or Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the "Additional
154

Amounts") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holders or the Trustee, as the case may be, after such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:
(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note or the Indenture or any Guarantee in respect thereof;
(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason o f the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner o f the Note to comply with a written request o f the Payor addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding such be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice o f the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;
(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by withholding from a payment o f the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes;
(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(5) any Taxes that are required to be deducted or withheld on a payment to an individual pursuant to the Directive or any law implementing, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive;
(6) except in the case of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up o f the Payor, any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another paying agent in a member state o f the European Union; or
(7) any combination of the above.
Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary o f the payment had presented the Note for payment (where presentation is required) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason o f any of clauses (1) to (7) inclusive above.
The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies o f tax receipts evidencing the payment o f any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices o f the Paying Agent. The Payor will attach to each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such withholding Taxes paid per 1,000 principal amount of the Notes.
155

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer's Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this "Description o f the Notes" there is mentioned, in any context:
(1) the payment of principal,
(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes,
(3) interest, or
(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee,
such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise, property or similar Taxes, charges or levies that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of any Notes, the Guarantees, the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer o f the Notes) excluding any such Taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, and the Payor agrees to indemnify the Holders for any such Taxes paid by such Holders. The foregoing obligations o f this paragraph will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge o f the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.
Change of Control
If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading "Change of Control", each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such Holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date o f purchase (subject to the right o f Holders o f record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this heading, "Change of Control", in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all o f the Notes as described under "-- Optional Redemption" or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.
Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under "-- Optional Redemption" or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change o f Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:
(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% o f the principal amount o f such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date o f purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the "Change o f Control Payment");
(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) and the record date (the "Change of Control Payment Date");
(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control
156

Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control;
(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and
(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:
(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered;
(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;
(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the principal Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and
(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.
If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder o f Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a public announcement with respect to the results o f the Change o f Control Offer as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date in a newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder's right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder's Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.
The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change o f Control Offer is made.
157

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements o f Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change o f Control provisions o f the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.
The Issuer's ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence o f certain o f the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment o f Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Series A Senior Loan. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Flolders o f their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change o f Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer's ability to pay cash to the Flolders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer's then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes-- We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture".
The definition o f "Change of Control" includes a disposition o f all or substantially all o f the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all", there is no precise established definition o f the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of "all or substantially all" o f the property or assets o f a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. In addition, you should note that recent case law suggests that, in the event that incumbent directors are replaced as a result of a contested election, issuers may nevertheless avoid triggering a change of control under clauses similar to clause (2) of the definition of "Change of Control" if the outgoing directors were to approve the new directors for the puiposes o f that clause.
The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result o f a Change o f Control may be waived or modified with the written consent o f Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.
Certain Covenants
Limitation on Indebtedness
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any of the Guarantors may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is less than (x) 6.75 to 1.0, if the date o f such Incurrence is prior to the one year anniversary o f the Completion Date, or (y) 6.0 to 1.0, if the date of such Incurrence is on or after the one year anniversary o f the Completion Date.
The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:
(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters o f credit or bankers' acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) 300.0 million, plus (ii) in the case o f any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof,
158

the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing, less (iii) the aggregate amount of all Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions since the Issue Date applied by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to the covenant described under "--Limitation on Sale of Assets and Subsidiary Stock" to repay any Indebtedness under any Credit Facility incurred pursuant to this clause (1) (and in respect of any revolving credit facility, to permanently reduce commitments thereunder);
(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of (i) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) any Guarantee by a Parent o f Indebtedness o f the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaiy, in each case, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms o f the Indenture; or
(b) without limiting the covenant described under "--Limitation on Liens", Indebtedness arising by reason o f any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness o f the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms o f the Indenture;
(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiaiy owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:
(a) in the case of Indebtedness owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, to the extent such Indebtedness is not expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees;
(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary o f the Issuer; and
(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer,
shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiaiy, as the case may be;
(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes), (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness Incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility or described in clause (3) o f this paragraph) outstanding on the Issue Date and the Series A Senior Loan, (c) any Indebtedness of the Securitas Direct Group outstanding on the Completion Date, (d) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4) or clauses (5), (7), (11) and (13) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph o f this covenant, (e) Management Advances and (I) any loan or other instrument contributing the proceeds of the Notes;
(5) Indebtedness of any Person outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiaiy of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaiy; provided, however, with respect to this clause (5), that at the time of such acquisition or other transaction (x) the Issuer would have been able to Incur 1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph o f this covenant after giving pro forma effect to the relevant acquisition and the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5) or (y) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would not be greater than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction;
(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging Agreements not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or the Issuer);
(7) Indebtedness consisting of (A) Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase Money Obligations or other financings, incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost o f construction or improvement o f property, plant or equipment used
159

in a Similar Business or (B) Indebtedness otherwise incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of design, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any time outstanding the greater of 0.6% of Total Assets or 15.0 million; so long as the Indebtedness exists on the date of such purchase, lease, rental or improvement or is created within 180 days thereafter;
(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers' compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax or other guarantees or other similar bonds, instruments or obligations and completion guarantees and warranties provided by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiaiy or relating to liabilities, obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course o f business, (b) letters of credit, bankers' acceptances, guarantees or other similar instruments or obligations issued or relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary course o f business, provided, however, that upon the drawing o f such letters of credit or other similar instruments, the obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing, (c) the financing of insurance premiums in the ordinary course of business and (d) any customary cash management, cash pooling or netting or setting off arrangements in the ordinary course of business;
(9) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for customary guarantees, indemnification, obligations in respect o f earnouts or other adjustments o f purchase price or, in each case, similar obligations, in each case, Incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business or assets or Person or any Capital Stock of a Subsidiaiy (other than Guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring or disposing o f such business or assets or such Subsidiaiy for the purpose o f financing such acquisition or disposition); provided that the maximum liability o f the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect o f all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the fair market value o f non cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition;
(10) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within 30 Business Days of Incurrence;
(11) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (11) and then outstanding, will not exceed 30.0 million; provided that the aggregate outstanding principal amount o f Indebtedness Incurred by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors pursuant to this clause (11) does not exceed at any time an amount of 20.0 million;
(12) Indebtedness Incurred by a Receivables Subsidiaiy in a Qualified Receivables Financing;
(13) Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (13) and then outstanding, will not exceed 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiaiy) of its Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded Contribution) o f the Issuer, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash
160

Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for puiposes of making Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (10) o f the third paragraph o f the covenant described below under "Certain Covenants--Limitation on Restricted Payments" to the extent the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13) to the extent the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below under "Certain Covenants--Limitation on Restricted Payments" in reliance thereon; and
(14) Indebtedness under daylight borrowing facilities incurred in connection with the Transactions or any refinancing of Indebtedness (including by way of set-off or exchange) so long as any such Indebtedness is repaid within three days of the date on which such Indebtedness is Incurred.
For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:
(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria o f more than one o f the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one o f the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;
(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Completion Date under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be deemed initially Incurred on the Completion Date under clause (1) o f the second paragraph o f the description of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph o f the description o f this covenant, and may not be reclassified pursuant to clause (1) o f this paragraph;
(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;
(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11) or (13) o f the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;
(5) the principal amount o f any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatoiy redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; and
(6) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount o f the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis o f IFRS.
Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes o f the covenant described under this "-- Limitation on Indebtedness". The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.
If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if
161

such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this "--Limitation on Indebtedness", the Issuer shall be in Default o f this covenant).
For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent o f the principal amount o f Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case o f term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case o f Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition o f Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent o f the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount o f such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.
Notwithstanding any other provision o f this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result o f fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount o f any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.
No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right o f payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue o f being unsecured or by virtue o f being secured on a first or junior Lien basis and the Series B Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right o f payment to the Series A Indebtedness.
Limitation on Restricted Payments
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:
(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of the Issuer's or any Restricted Subsidiaiy's Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Issuer or any o f its Restricted Subsidiaries) except:
(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock o f the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock) or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Capital Stock of the Issuer or in Subordinated Shareholder Funding;
(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of any such Restricted Subsidiaiy making such dividend or distribution, to holders of its Capital Stock other than the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiaiy on no more than a pro rata basis, measured by value); and
(c) dividends or distributions payable to any Parent in respect of Indebtedness of such Parent which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary.
(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent o f the Issuer held by Persons other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer (other than in exchange for Capital Stock o f the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock));
(3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any Subordinated Indebtedness (other than (a) any such payment, purchase,
162

repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph o f the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness") or any Subordinated Shareholder Funding; or
(4) make any Restricted Investment in any Person;
(any such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition, retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (4) are referred to herein as a "Restricted Payment"), if at the time the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:
(a) a Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately thereafter therefrom);
(b) the Issuer is not able to Incur an additional 1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph o f the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness" after giving effect, on a pro forma basis, to such Restricted Payment; or
(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted Payments permitted below by clauses (10), (11), (12) and (18) of the second succeeding paragraph and the aggregate amount of all redemptions made pursuant to clause (2) of "-- Order of Redemption" if such redemptions are made pursuant to this first paragraph or clause (11) or (18) of the third paragraph o f this covenant, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the second succeeding paragraph) would exceed the sum of (without duplication):
(i) 50% o f Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting period) fiom the first day o f the fiscal quarter in which the Completion Date occurred to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of such Restricted Payment for which internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available (or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit);
(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined in accordance with the next succeeding paragraph) o f property or assets or marketable securities, received by the Issuer from the issue or sale of its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding subsequent to the Issue Date or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) o f the Issuer subsequent to the Issue Date (other than (x) Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received fiom an issuance or sale of such Capital Stock to a Restricted Subsidiary or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, (y) Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities to the extent that any Restricted Payment has been made from such proceeds in reliance on clause (6) o f the second succeeding paragraph and (z) Excluded Contributions);
(iii) 100% o f the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined in accordance with the next succeeding paragraph) o f property or assets or marketable securities, received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the issuance or sale (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaiy) by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaiy subsequent to the Issue Date of any Indebtedness that has

The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes "Excess Proceeds". Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms o f the Indenture.
On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds 30.0 million, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer ("Asset Disposition Offer") to all Holders (first to holders of the Series A Notes, then, provided any Excess Proceeds remain, to Holders o f the Series B Notes) and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness (first to holders of Series A Indebtedness, then, provided any Excess Proceeds remain, to holders of Series B Indebtedness), to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out o f the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect o f the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price o f no more than) 100% o f the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount o f Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of 100,000 and in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof.
To the extent that the aggregate amount o f Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount o f the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount o f Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.
171

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period o f not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the "Asset Disposition Offer Period"). No later than five Business Days after the termination o f the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the "Asset Disposition Purchase Date"), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the "Asset Disposition Offer Amount") or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.
On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations o f 100,000 and in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination o f the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer's Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entiy) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion o f the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination o f 100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.
The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements o f Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.
Limitation on Affiliate Transactions
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering o f any service) with any Affiliate o f the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an "Affiliate Transaction") involving aggregate value in excess of 5.0 million unless:
(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time o f such transaction or the execution o f the agreement providing for such transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;
(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of15.0 million, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority o f the members of the Board o f Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above; and

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course o f business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaiy and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiaiy or any Affiliate of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

disclosure; (ii) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information o f the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning o f the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates (provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials); (iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion o f the consolidated financial condition, results o f operations, Consolidated EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer; (iv) a discussion of material changes in material debt instruments since the most recent report; and (v) material subsequent events and any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent annual report; provided that the information described in clauses (iv) and (v) may be provided in the footnotes to the unaudited financial statements; and
(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director changes at the Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.
In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not "affiliates" under the Securities Act.
The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders o f the Notes copies o f all reports furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer's website and if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List o f the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and to the extent that the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, copies of such reports furnished to the Trustee will also be made available at the specified office of the paying agent in Luxembourg.

No report need include separate financial statements for any Guarantors or non Guarantor Subsidiaries o f the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not o f a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

At any time that any o f the Issuer's subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiaiy or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this "Reports to Holders" covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face o f the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, o f the financial condition and results o f operations o f the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results o f operations o f the Unrestricted Subsidiaries o f the Issuer. For purposes o f this covenant and any calculation to be made under the Indenture, the Issuer may use the financial statements of a predecessor of the Issuer or Securitas Direct for reporting or making calculations with respect to periods commencing prior to the Completion Date.
175

All reports provided pursuant to this "Reports to Holders" covenant shall be made in the English language.
In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) o f the Exchange Act (other than the provision o f U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.
Merger and Consolidation
The Issuer
The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:
(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor Company") will be a Person organized and existing under the laws o f any member state o f the European Union, or the United States o f America, any State o f the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactoiy to the Trustee, all the obligations o f the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;
(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation o f the Successor Company or any Subsidiary o f the Successor Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional 1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness" or (b) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would not be greater than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and
(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactoiy to the Trustee), provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to any matters of fact.
Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation o f the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under "-- Limitation on Indebtedness".
For purposes o f this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition o f all or substantially all of the properties and assets o f one or more Subsidiaries o f the Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead o f such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all o f the
176

properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.
The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.
There is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve "all or substantially all" o f the property or assets of a Person.
The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this "Merger and Consolidation" covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the Issuer has complied with the covenant described under "--Limitation on Sales o f Assets and Subsidiary Stock" or (ii) the creation o f a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary o f the Issuer.
The Guarantors
None of the Guarantors (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms o f the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement) may:
(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation),
(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person, or
(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it
unless
(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor; or
(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all o f the obligations o f the Guarantor under its Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); and
(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or
(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture,
provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) o f this covenant shall not apply to the extent that compliance with clauses (A) and (B) (1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders o f the partners o f such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.
The provisions set forth in this "Merger and Consolidation" covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or
177

transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations o f the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading "--Issuer" shall apply to such transaction; and (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose o f changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form o f such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading "--The Issuer" or "--The Guarantors", as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction.
There is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person.
Suspension o f Covenants on Achievement o f Investment Grade Status
If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a "Suspension Event"), then, beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the "Reversion Date"), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes: "--Limitation on Restricted Payments", "--Limitation on Indebtedness", "--Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries", "Certain Covenants--Limitation on Affiliate Transactions", "-- Limitation on Sales o f Assets and Subsidiary Stock", the provisions o f clause (3) o f the first paragraph o f the covenant described under "--Merger and Consolidation" and "--Impairment of Security Interest" and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The "Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance o f the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "-- Limitation on Indebtedness". In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status.
Impairment o fSecurity Interest
The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence o f Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit o f the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any o f the Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; provided, however, that in the case o f clause (i) above, except with respect to any discharge or release in accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or any action
178

expressly permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency o f the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board o f Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.
Additional Guarantees
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Series A Senior Loan, any Credit Facility or any other Public Debt o f the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee is incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiaiy shall not be obligated to become such a guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee is contrary to agreed security principles and could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiaiy (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out o f pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary.
Future Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under "--Releases of the Guarantees". A Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option o f the Issuer if at the date of such release either (i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor, or (ii) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessaiy actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.
The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability o f the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests".
179

A dditional Intercreditor Agreements
The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries (or for the purpose of giving effect to the ranking of such Indebtedness under "--Right of Payment") o f any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness" or clause (1), (4), (5), (6), (7) (other than with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations), (11) or (13) o f the second paragraph o f the covenant described under "-- Limitation on Indebtedness" and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (1), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an "Additional Intercreditor Agreement") or a restatement, amendment or other modification o f the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interest; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities o f the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or a Guarantor that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right o f payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent o f the Holders o f the majority in aggregate principal amount o f the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under "Amendments and Waivers", and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under "--Limitation on Restricted Payments".
The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at the offices of the Trustee.
Business Activities
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any o f its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any business other than Similar Businesses, except to the extent that would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
180

(1) default in any payment o f interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any o f its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment o f which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:
(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the expiration o f the grace period provided in such Indebtedness ("payment default"); or
(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "cross acceleration provision"),
and, in each case, either (i) the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity o f which has been so accelerated, aggregates 25.0 million or more or (ii) such Indebtedness is incurred pursuant to clause (1) o f the second paragraph o f the "--Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant secured by Collateral that is granted the benefit of super senior priority rights on the proceeds of enforcement of Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, and (A) the initial 30 day consultation period under the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the enforcement of such Indebtedness has expired, (B) certain insolvency events have occurred or (C) the consultation period under the Intercreditor Agreement does not apply because the Majority Super Senior Creditors have determined in good faith that to enter into consultation could reasonably be expected to reduce the amount likely to be realized upon enforcement such that the obligations owed to them would not be discharged in full and have instructed the securing agent as to the enforcement o f the Collateral;
(5) certain events o f bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or group o f Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as o f the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the "bankruptcy provisions");
(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of 25.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period o f 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the "judgment default provision");
(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms o f the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture and except through the gross negligence or willful misconduct o f the Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of 10.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such
181

security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days; and
(8) any Guarantee of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiaiy ceases to be in lull force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms o f such Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days.
However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders o f 25% in principal amount o f the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.
If an Event o f Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders o f at least 25% in principal amount o f the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration o f the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under "Events of Default" has occurred and is continuing, the declaration o f acceleration o f the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration o f acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration o f the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree o f a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events o f Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because o f the acceleration o f the Notes, have been cured or waived.
If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.
Holders o f the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events o f Default (except with respect to nonpayment o f principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Subject to the provisions o f the Indenture relating to the duties o f the Trustee, if an Event o f Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any o f the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:
(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount o f the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
182

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;
(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt o f the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
(5) the Holders o f a majority in principal amount o f the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.
Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.
The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event o f Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights o f any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or security satisfactoiy to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment o f principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee o f trust officers o f the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests o f the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer's Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.
The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an "Initial Default") then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled "--Reports to Holders" or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.
The Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf o f the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.
Amendments and Waivers
Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent o f the Majority Voting Creditors (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent o f the Majority Voting Creditors (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). However, without the consent o f the Super Majority Voting Creditors, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or modification;
183

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;
(3) reduce the principal o f or extend the Stated Maturity o f any Note;
(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under "--Optional Redemption";
(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;
(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder's Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder's Notes;
(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under "Withholding Taxes" that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;
(8) release all or substantially all the security interests granted for the benefit o f the Holders in the Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;
(9) waive a Default or Event o f Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration o f the Notes by the Holders o f at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver o f the payment default that resulted fi'om such acceleration); or
(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders' consent described in this sentence;
provided, however, that if such amendment or waiver described in clauses (2), (3) and (4) above only affects or would only affect Holders of the Series A Fixed Rate Notes, Series A Floating Rate Notes or Series B Notes, and does not or would not affect Holders o f the Notes generally, only the consent of Holders o f not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of Series A Fixed Rate Notes, Series A Floating Rate Notes or Series B Notes, respectively, shall be required, and such amendment or waiver shall not require the consent of the Super Majority Voting Creditors.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Voting Creditor, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Secured Notes Documents to:
(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;
(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under any Senior Secured Notes Document;
(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit o f the Holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;
(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any o f the Holders in any material respect under the Senior Secured Notes Documents;
(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;
(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiaiy to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the Covenant described under "Certain Covenants-Limitation on Indebtedness", to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking o f any Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is
184

provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Guarantees, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision o f this "Description o f the Notes" to the extent that such provision in this "Description o f the Notes" was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, a Guarantee, the Security Documents or the Notes;
(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Senior Secured Notes Document;
(9) in the case o f the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor o f the Security Agent for the benefit o f the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit Facility or the Series A Senior Loan, in any property which is required by the Security Documents, the Revolving Credit Facility or the Series A Senior Loan (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under "Certain Covenants-- Impairment of Security Interest" is complied with; or
(10) as provided in "Certain Covenants--Additional Intercreditor Agreements".
In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer's Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.
The consent o f the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder's Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver in Luxembourg in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Such notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver may also be published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).
Acts by Holders
In determining whether the Holders o f the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.
Defeasance
The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture ("legal defeasance") and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities o f the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights o f the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).
185

The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations under the covenants described under "Certain Covenants" (other than clauses (1) and (2) of "Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation") and "Change of Control" and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under "Events of Default" above, the operation o f the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under "Events of Default" above ("covenant defeasance").
The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment o f the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under "Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation"), (3), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under "Events of Default" above.
In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the "defeasance trust") with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this puipose) cash in euros or eurodenominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:
(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax puiposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling o f the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);
(2) an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;
(3) an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;
(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and
(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.
Satisfaction and Discharge
The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving o f notice o f redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, o f the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose), money or euro-denominated European Government
186

Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; and (4) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion o f Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the "Satisfaction and Discharge" section o f the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge o f the Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).
No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders
No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder o f the Issuer or any o f their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations o f the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part o f the consideration for issuance o f the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view o f the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.
Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents
Wilmington Trust, National Association is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event o f Default, the Trustee will exercise such o f the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.
The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.
The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount o f the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain minimum limits regarding the aggregate of its capital and surplus or (c) becomes incapable o f acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than 6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.
Any removal or resignation o f the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.
The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.
Notices
For so long as any o f the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules o f the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, notices with respect to the Notes o f the Issuer listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange will be published in a leading newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or if, in the opinion of the Issuer such publication is not practicable, in an English language newspaper having general circulation in Europe. In
187

addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders o f the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf o f the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream. Such notices may also be published on the website o f the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).
Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.
Prescription
Claims against the Issuer for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.
Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions
The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under or in connection with the Notes and the relevant Guarantees, as the case may be, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent o f the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date o f that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).
If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes o f this currency indemnify provision, it will be primafacie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder o f a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactoiy to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer's and the Guarantor's other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver o f the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect o f any sum due under any Note, any Guarantee or to the Trustee.
Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for puiposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.
Enforceability of Judgments Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment o f principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.
188

Consent to Jurisdiction and Service
In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees, the Issuer and each Guarantor will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State ofNew York, United States.
Governing Law
The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State ofNew York. The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.
