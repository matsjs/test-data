DESCRIPTION OF THE SECOND LIEN NOTES
Perstorp Holding AB (publ) (the "Company") will issue $370 million aggregate principal amount of 11% Second Lien Notes due 2017 (the "Notes'") under a second lien notes indenture dated November 15, 2012 (the "Indenture") between, among others, the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, as the trustee (the "Trustee"), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. Securities Act").
Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under "-- Certain Definitions" have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture which is incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading "-- Certain Definitions." In this description, references to (i) the "Company" refers only to Perstorp Holding AB and not to any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) "we," "our," "us" refer to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this "Description of the Second Lien Notes" to the "Notes" include the Notes and any Additional Notes (as defined below) that are issued. The terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture will not incorporate or include any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The Security Documents referred to below under the caption "-- Security" define the terms of the security that will secure the Notes.
The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and refers to the Security Documents, the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement and the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement and certain other agreements relating to the Notes. This description does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents, the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement and the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Note, the Security Documents, the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement and the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth below under "--Additional Information."
The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under the Indenture.
As of the Issue Date, all of the Company's Subsidiaries other than Perstorp Holding Singapore Pte Ltd and its subsidiaries, Perstorp Singapore Pte Ltd and PLS Holding Pte Ltd, (the "Singapore Entities") will be "Restricted Subsidiaries" for purposes of the Indenture. Under the circumstances described below under the caption "-- Certain Covenants--Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries," the Company will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as "UnrestrictedSubsidiaries." The restrictive covenants in the Indenture do not apply to Unrestricted Subsidiaries. The Singapore Entities and any other Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes.
Principal, Maturity and Interest
The Company will issue $370 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes in this offering. The Company may issue additional notes ("Additional Notes") under the Indenture from time to time after this offering. Any issuance of Additional Notes is subject to all of the covenants in the Indenture, including the covenant described below under the caption "-- Certain Covenants--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock." The initial Notes and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture. The Company will issue Notes in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will mature on August 15, 2017.
Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 11.00% per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrear on February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15, 2013. The Company will make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding February 1 and August 1.
Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Interest on overdue principal and interest and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the applicable interest rate on the Notes.

Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees
The Notes
The Notes:
· will be general obligations of the Company;
· will be guaranteed by the Guarantors;
· will be secured by second-priority Liens over the Collateral, as described below under "-- Security";
· will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Company that is either (i) secured by a Lien on the Collateral that is senior or prior to the Lien securing the Notes, including the first-priority liens securing the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Notes or (ii) secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, in each case to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;
· will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of the Company that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Notes;
· will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of the Company that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including Indebtedness under the Mezzanine Facility;
· will be subject to a restriction on the Group making payments under the Notes after the occurrence of an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Parallel Intercreditor); and
· will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Company's Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors.
Guarantees
The Notes will initially be guaranteed by Perstorp AB (publ), Perstorp Specialty Chemicals AB, Perstorp Fastighets AB, Perstorp Oxo AB, Formox AB, Perstorp BioProducts AB, Perstorp Butenderivat AB, Perstorp Holding GmbH, Perstorp Chemicals GmbH, Perstorp Polyols Inc., Perstorp Holding (U.S.) Inc., and Perstorp UK Limited. For a description of certain guarantee limitations, see "Certain Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."
The Guarantee of each Guarantor:
· will be a general obligation of such Guarantor and have the following features under the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement:
· following the occurrence of certain types of Enforcement Action (as defined in the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement), will be subject to turnover and a requirement to direct the person responsible for collection of distributions (including by way of set-off) to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the first-priority senior secured liabilities have been paid in full;
· following the turnover described above, creditors in respect of which will receive distributions from the Security Agent in accordance with the application of proceeds waterfall for proceeds of enforcement of Collateral, which provides for the payment in full of the first-priority senior secured liabilities prior to any application toward the Second Lien Notes and any future second lien liabilities; and
· will be subject to a limited standstill on enforcement of Guarantors and their subsidiaries that are being sold by the first-lien secured creditors pursuant to a Distressed Disposal (as defined in the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement).
221

· will be secured by second-priority Liens and over the Collateral; and
· will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is either (i) secured by a Lien on the Collateral that is senior or prior to the Lien securing the Guarantee, including the first- priority liens securing the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Notes or (ii) secured by property or assets that do not secure the Guarantee, in each case to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness.
Assuming we had completed the Refinancing and applied the proceeds therefrom as described under "Use of Proceeds," as of June 30, 2012, the Company and the Guarantors would have had total debt excluding shareholder debt of $1,453 million, including, without limitation, $722 million (equivalent) of debt outstanding under the Senior Secured Notes $370 million of debt outstanding under the Notes and $328 million of debt outstanding under the Mezzanine Facility Agreement. In addition, we will have SEK 550 million available for drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Indenture will permit the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional Indebtedness in the future. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2012, the Company and the Guarantors generated 82% of our net sales and 89% of our EBITDA, and as at June 30, 2012 the Company and the Guarantors held 87% of our consolidated total assets.
The Company is a holding company without operations, and, therefore, the Company depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligation under the Notes. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Company's Subsidiaries that do not provide Guarantees.
Parallel Intercreditor Agreement
On the Issue Date, the Trustee will enter into the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement as a "Second Lien Notes Trustee" (as defined in the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement) for holders of the Notes. The Security Agent, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and the trustee for the Senior Secured Notes will also enter into the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement. The Parallel Intercreditor Agreement governs, among other things, the rights and obligations of the "Senior Finance Parties" (as defined in the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement and including lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, creditors in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, holders of the Notes and certain hedging counterparties), in respect of enforcement of the Guarantees and the Collateral. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Parallel Intercreditor Agreement."
Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes
The Company will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a "Paying A gent") for the Notes, including a Paying Agent in the City of London (the "Principal Paying A gent"). The Company will ensure that it maintains a Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing, or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive. The initial Paying Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon (Luxembourg) S.A.
The Company will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a "Registrar") for so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and its rules so require. The Company will also maintain a transfer agent (a "Transfer A g en t"). The initial Registrar will be The Bank of New York Mellon (Luxembourg) S.A. The initial Transfer Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon (Luxembourg) S.A. The Registrar and the Transfer Agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes (as defined under "Book-Entry, Delivery and Form") outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Company.
The Company may change the Paying Agents, the Registrars or the Transfer Agents without prior notice to the holders of Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Company will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).
222

Transfer and Exchange

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "144A Global Notes'"), and Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "Reg S Global Notes" and together with the 144A Global Notes, the "Global Notes").

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the "Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to Persons that have accounts with DTC or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under "Notice to Investors." In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in DTC will be effected by DTC pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by DTC and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note, or the "Restricted Book-Entry Interest" may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note, as applicable, or the "Reg S BookEntry Interests" only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest (as defined under "Book-Entry, Delivery and Form") that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the applicable Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Company in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under "Notice to Investors."

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, to Persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at DTC where appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions and pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange; provided that, if the Company or any Guarantor is a party to the transfer or exchange, the holder will not be required to pay such Taxes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive Registered Notes:

(1)

for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2)

for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3)

for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4)

which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control

Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.

The Company, the Trustee and the Paying Agents will be entitled to treat the holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

223

Additional Amounts

All payments made by or on behalf of the Company under or with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors with respect to any Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Company or any Guarantor is then incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision thereof or therein or (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor (including the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent) or any political subdivision thereof or therein (each, a "Tax Jurisdiction") will at any time be required to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Company under or with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors with respect to any Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, the Company or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the "AdditionalAmounts"") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder after such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:

(1)

any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or

former connection between the holder or the beneficial owner of the Notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor,

beneficiary, partner of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, the relevant holder, if the

relevant holder is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the

relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or having been a citizen, resident, or national

thereof or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business therein or having or having had a

permanent establishment therein), but excluding any connection arising merely from the holding of such

Note, the enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Guarantee or the receipt of any payments in

respect of such Note or a Guarantee;

(2)

any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment

(where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for

payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts

had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(3)

any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes, or excise taxes imposed on

transfer of Notes;

(4)

any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to an individual that are required to be made

pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of

the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law

implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive;

(5)

any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner of Notes who

would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another

Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(6)

any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to, the

Notes or with respect to any Guarantee;

(7)

any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or

beneficial owner of Notes, following the Company's written request addressed to the holder or beneficial

owner (and made at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply

with that request), to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting

requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction,

as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed

by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is

not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is

legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation);

224

(8)

any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Company or Guarantor to the holder if such

holder is a fiduciary or partnership or any Person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to

the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payments had such holder been the sole

beneficial owner of such Note; or

(9)

any combination of items (1) through (8) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Company and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Guarantee or any other document referred to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes other than the initial resale by the initial purchasers) or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited, solely in the case of taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (5) above or any combination thereof), or any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Notes or any Guarantee.

If the Company or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, each of the Company or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the Company or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer's Certificate must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

The Company or the relevant Guarantor will make or cause to be made all withholdings and deductions required by law and will timely remit or cause to be remitted the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Company or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Company or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Company or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. If requested by the Trustee, the Company or the Guarantors will provide to the Trustee such information as may be in the possession o f the Company or the Guarantors (and not otherwise in the possession o f the Trustee) to enable the Trustee to determine the amount of withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder, provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or the Guarantors be required to disclose any information that it reasonably deems to be confidential.

Whenever in the Indenture or in this "Description of the Second Lien Notes" there is mentioned, in any context, the payment o f amounts based upon the principal amount o f the Notes or any Guarantee or o f principal, interest or o f any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any o f the Notes, such mention shall be deemed to include mention o f the payment o f Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge o f the Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Company or any Guarantor is incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment on the Notes (or any Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.

The Guarantees

The Notes will be guaranteed by the companies listed under "--Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees-- Guarantees" as of the Issue Date. The Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors.

Each of the Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor without rendering its guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law,
225

including laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or otherwise to reflect applicable laws, including laws relating to capital maintenance and the liability of directors and officers. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's obligations under its Guarantee or any security interest, as applicable, could be significantly less than amounts payable in respect of the Notes. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Structure--Each Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability." and "Certain Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."

The operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore the Company depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. Not all of the Company's Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Company's non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Company or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary's creditors, except to the extent that the Company or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary senior to that held by the Company or such Guarantor. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Structure--The Senior Secured Notes and the Second Lien Notes will each be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries."

The Guarantees will have the features described above under "--Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees." Upon any distribution to the creditors of a Guarantor in liquidation, administration, bankruptcy moratorium of payments, dissolution or other winding up of such Guarantor, the holders of senior secured debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full before any payment may be made with respect to the Second Lien Note Guarantees. As a result, holders of Second Lien Notes may receive less, rateably, than the holders of senior secured debt of the Guarantors, including the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

Release of the Guarantees

The Guarantees will be released:

(1)

in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that

Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a Person that is

not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the

sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the "Asset Sale" provisions of the Indenture;

(2)

in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Guarantor or any holding

company of such Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction)

the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the "Asset

Sale" provisions of the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the

sale, transfer or other disposition;

(3)

if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in

accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(4)

upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided

below under the captions "--Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance" and "-- Satisfaction and

Discharge" ;

(5)

upon the sale of all the Capital Stock of, or all or substantially all of the assets of, that Guarantor or its

parent entity pursuant to a security enforcement sale in compliance with the Parallel Intercreditor

Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(6)

upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Company under the Indenture and

the Notes;

(7)

in accordance with the caption entitled "--Amendment, Supplement and Waiver";

226

(8)

as a result of a transaction permitted by "--Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets"; or

(9)

with respect to the Guarantee of any Guarantor that was required to provide such Guarantee pursuant to the

covenant described under the caption "-- Certain Covenants--Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of

Indebtedness" upon such Guarantor being unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with

respect to the Indebtedness giving rise to the requirement to provide such Guarantee so long as no other

Indebtedness is at that time guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor that would result in the requirement that

such Guarantor provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under the caption "-- Certain

Covenants--Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness."

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release as specified above, the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, will execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such guarantee. Neither the Company nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

Collateral

General

The obligations of the Company under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Guarantees will be secured, on a second-priority basis, by all assets that secure on a first-priority basis the Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The Collateral (as defined below), at the Issue Date, will consist of:

"Collateral" means:

(1)

our shares in the share capital of Perstorp Butenderivat AB, Perstorp Holding GmbH and Vencorex;

(2)

our and our Restricted Subsidiaries' shares in the share capital of the Guarantors;

(3)

the Capital Stock in certain Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors;

(4)

certain bank accounts of certain of the Guarantors;

(5)

certain fixed and current assets of certain of the Guarantors (including in certain cases account receivables);

(6)

Financiére Foret S.å r.l.'s shares in the share capital of the Company;

(7) business mortgage agreements granted by certain Swedish Guarantors;

(8)

substantially all of the property and assets of Perstorp U.K. Limited;

(9)

a global assignment of receivables of Perstorp Chemicals GmbH;

(10) a security transfer of certain fixed and current assets of Perstorp Chemicals GmbH; and

(11) security assignment of certain intercompany loans. See "Description o f the Senior Secured Notes'" and "Description o f the Second Lien Notes."

The Liens securing the Notes and the Guarantees will also secure the obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and certain hedging obligations on a first-priority basis and the Mezzanine Facility Agreement on a junior priority basis. The assets and property of the Company and its subsidiaries that are from time to time subject to, or required to be subject to, a Lien pursuant to the Security Documents are referred to as the "Collateral." The security and other agreements in respect of the Collateral are referred to as the "Security Documents."

227

Under the Security Documents, the Collateral will be pledged by the Company and the Guarantors to secure the payment when due of the Company's and the Guarantors', as applicable, payment obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by, inter alios, the Security Agent or its nominee(s), who will act as Security Agent for the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the trustee for the Senior Secured Notes, holders of the Senior Secured Notes, lenders under the Mezzanine Facility Agreement and for the Trustee and the holders of Notes.
Each holder of Notes, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed (i) to have authorized the Trustee to enter into the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement and the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Agent to enter into the Security Documents, the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement and the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) to be bound thereby. Each holder of Notes, by accepting a Note, appoints the Trustee or the Security Agent, as the case may be, as its agent under the Security Documents, the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement and the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement and authorizes it to act as such.
The holders of the Notes are not a party to the Security Documents, and therefore holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The holders may only act through the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable. The Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the holders. The Trustee will have the ability to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action under the Security Documents in certain limited circumstances. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Parallel Intercreditor Agreement."
Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Company and the Guarantors, as the case may be, will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing) in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral.
The value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy the Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees, and the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Indenture. Please see "Risk Factors--Risks Relating to the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Second Lien Notes--The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the Notes and the Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees," "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Second Lien Notes-- Claims of our first-priority senior secured creditors will have priority with respect to their security over the claims of the holders of the Second Lien Notes."
No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantors in connection with this offering of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the Indenture and the Security Documents following an Event of Default, would be sufficient to satisfy amounts due on the Notes or the Guarantees. By its nature, some or all the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be sold in a timely manner or at all. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Financial Profile--It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes" and "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Financial Profile-- Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging liabilities are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes."
The Security Documents are governed by English law or the laws o f the other jurisdictions to which the Collateral is subject and provide that the rights with respect to the Notes and the Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent and in respect of the entire outstanding amount of the Notes. The term "Security Interests" refers to the Liens in the Collateral.
For a description of certain intercreditor features, see "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Revolving Credit Facility--Events of Default" and "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Parallel Intercreditor Agreement--Limitations on enforcement."
Under the Indenture, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to incur certain additional Indebtedness in the future that may share in the Collateral, including Indebtedness with priority rights to the Collateral. The amount of such additional Indebtedness will be limited by the covenants described under the captions "-- Certain
228

Covenants--Liens" and "-- Certain Covenants--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock." Under certain circumstances, the amount of such additional Indebtedness that may share in the Collateral could be significant.

Each of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall, and shall procure that each of its respective Subsidiaries, if any, shall, at its own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may reasonably require (i) for registering any Security Document relating to the Collateral in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Facility Security Document relating to the Collateral; and (ii) if such Security Document is enforced in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the relevant Security Document, the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement and the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Document and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of the Collateral. Each of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall, and shall procure that each of its respective Subsidiaries, if any, shall, execute such transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give such notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may reasonably request.

Release o f the Collateral

The Collateral will be released from the Lien over such Collateral:

(1)

in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property or

assets to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or any of

its Restricted Subsidiaries, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the "Asset Sale" provisions of the

Indenture (subject to certain limitations in the case of a Swedish Guarantor);

(2)

in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital Stock of a Guarantor or any holding

company of such Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction)

the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the

"Asset Sale" provisions of the Indenture (subject to certain limitations in the case of a Swedish Guarantor);

(3)

in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the

release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(4)

if the Company designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance

with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets of such Restricted

Subsidiary;

(5)

upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided

below under the captions "--Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance" and "-- Satisfaction and

Discharge" ;

(6)

in the case of a security enforcement sale in compliance with the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement, the

Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement the release of the property

and assets subject to such enforcement sale;

(7)

upon the full and final payment and performance of all financial obligations of the Company under the

Indenture and the Notes (subject to certain limitations in the case of a Swedish Guarantor);

(8)

in accordance with the caption entitled "--Amendment, Supplement and Waiver" (subject to certain

limitations in the case of a Swedish Guarantor);

(9)

in accordance with the covenant described under "-- Certain Covenants--Impairment of Security Interest";

and

(10) upon a release of the Lien that resulted in the creation of the Lien under the covenant described below under the caption "-- Certain Covenants--Liens."

The Company will not cause or permit, directly or indirectly, the Lien on the Capital Stock of Perstorp Butenderivat AB to be released, other than upon (5), (6) or (7) above.

229

The Security Agent and the Trustee will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement and the Mezzanine Intercreditor or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be affected by the Security Agent without the consent of the holders or any action on the part of the Trustee.

Optional Redemption

At maturity, the Notes will be redeemed at par. At any time prior to May 15, 2015, the Company may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture at a redemption price equal to 111.00% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, in each case, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption (subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date), with the net cash proceeds of an Equity Offering of (i) the Company or (ii) any Parent Entity to the extent the proceeds from such Equity Offering are contributed to the Company's common equity capital or are paid to the Company as consideration for the issuance of ordinary shares of the Company; provided that:

(1)

at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (in each case calculated after giving effect to

any issuance of Additional Notes but excluding Notes held by the Company and its Subsidiaries) remains

outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and

(2)

the redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time prior to May 15, 2015, the Company may on any one or more occasion redeem all or a part of the Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Except pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs and except pursuant to "--Redemption for Changes in Taxes," the Notes will not be redeemable at the Company's option prior to May 15, 2015.

On or after May 15, 2015, the Company may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed on or after the dates indicated below, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date:

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

Any redemption or notice may, in the Company's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent.

Redemption for Changes in Taxes

The Company may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in "-- Selection and Notice"), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Company for redemption (a "Tax Redemption Date") and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on
230

which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes or any Guarantee, the Company under or with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors with respect to any Guarantee is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts (but, in the case of the relevant Guarantor, only if such amount cannot be paid by the Company or a Guarantor who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and the Company or Guarantor, as applicable, cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available (including making payment through a paying agent located in another jurisdiction) and the requirement arises as a result of:

(1)

any amendment to, or change in, the laws or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder of a

relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly announced as formally

proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of this offering memorandum (or, if the

applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of this offering memorandum,

such later date); or

(2)

any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or application of such laws, regulations or

rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change

in published administrative practice) which amendment or change has not been publicly announced as

formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of the offering memorandum

(or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of this offering

memorandum, such later date) (each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), a "Change in Tax Law").

The Company will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts (or the relevant additional amounts) must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that there has been such Change in Tax Law which would entitle the Company to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Company publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts (or the relevant additional amounts) by the Company taking reasonable measures available to it.

Absent manifest error, the Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely (without any liability on the part of the Trustee arising from such reliance) on such Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.

The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Any redemption and notice described above will be subject to the receipt by the Company or any Paying Agent of sufficient funds from the Company to pay the full redemption price payable to the holders of the Notes on or before the Tax Redemption Date.

Mandatory Redemption

The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

Repurchase at the Option of Holders

Change o f Control

If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder's Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase (the "Change o f Control Payment"), subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.
231

Unless the Company has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes of a series as described under "--Optional Redemption" or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each holder of the Notes at such holder's registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under "-- Selection and Notice," stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Notes on the date (the "Change o f Control Payment Date") specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Securities-Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "U.S. Exchange A c t") and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with any applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:

(1)

accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control

Offer;

(2)

deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of

all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and

(3)

deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer's

Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the

Company.

The Principal Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of the Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any. The Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

The provisions described above that require the Company to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a holder of Notes' right to require the Company to repurchase such holder's Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Company or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption "--Optional Redemption," unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will provide and the Mezzanine Facility Agreement provides that the occurrence of a Change of Control would in each case require the repayment of all the outstanding Indebtedness thereunder. If the Company experiences a change of control that triggers a mandatory prepayment under its Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or Mezzanine Facility Agreement, the Company may seek the agreement of the relevant lenders thereunder to maintain the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Mezzanine Facility Agreement or seek to refinance the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Mezzanine Facility Agreement. In addition the occurrence of events constituting a Change of Control would trigger the requirement that the Company offer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes. Future debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Company from purchasing the Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or require a repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require the Company to purchase the Notes could cause a
232

default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if a Change of Control does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Company.

Finally, the Company's ability to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Company's then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Structure--We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes and the Second Lien Notes upon a change of control."

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of "all or substantially all" of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of the Notes to require the Company to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. In addition, you should note that case law suggests that, in the event that incumbent directors are replaced as a result of a contested election, issuers may nevertheless avoid triggering a change of control under a clause similar to clause (4) of the definition of "Change of Control" if the outgoing directors were to approve the new directors for the purpose of such change of control clause.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Company will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any Change of Control Offer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

Asset Sales

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1)

the Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the

Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or

otherwise disposed of; and

(2)

at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary

is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be

deemed to be cash:

(a)

any liabilities, as recorded on the balance sheet of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary

(other than contingent liabilities and other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in

right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantee), that are assumed by the transferee of any such

assets and as a result of which the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated

with respect to such liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities;

(b)

any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any such Restricted

Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary

into cash or Cash Equivalents within 90 days following the closing of the Asset Sale, to the extent

of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;

(c)

any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (1)(c) or (f) of the next paragraph of

this covenant;

233

(d)

any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in

such Asset Sales having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated

Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (d) that is at that time outstanding, not to

exceed the greater of $13.0 million and 0.5% of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such

Designated Non-Cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non

Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent

changes in value);

(e)

Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of

such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released

from any guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale; and

(f)

consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor received from Persons

who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary.

Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Company (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may:

(1)

apply such Net Proceeds (at the option of the Company or Restricted Subsidiary):

(a)

to purchase the Notes in an offer to all holders of Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the

principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the

date of purchase (a "Notes Offer");

(b)

(i) to repay Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor outstanding under clause (1) or (2) of

the definition of Permitted Debt or other Indebtedness that is secured by a First-Priority Lien on

the Collateral and that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantee and,

if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce

commitments with respect thereto; or (ii) to make an Asset Sale Offer (as defined below) to all

holders of the Notes and holders of other Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral

and that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Guarantees;

(c)

to purchase or permanently prepay or redeem or repay (i) any Indebtedness that is secured only by

Liens on assets or property that do not constitute Collateral and, if the Indebtedness prepaid,

redeemed or repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with

respect thereto or (ii) any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, other

than Indebtedness owed to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary (or any Affiliate

thereof);

(d)

to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted

Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is

or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(e)

to make a capital expenditure; or

(f)

to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) not classified as current assets under IFRS that

are used or useful in a Permitted Business.

(2)

enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Proceeds pursuant to clause (d), (e) or (f) of

paragraph (1) above; provided that such binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of

the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such

acquisition or expenditure is consummated, and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the

aforementioned 365 day period.

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Company (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.

234

Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant will constitute "Excess Proceeds'" When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds 25.0 million, within ten Business Days thereof, the Company will make an offer (an "Asset Sale Offer") to all holders of Notes and, to the extent notified by the Company in such notice, make an offer to all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes or any Guarantee to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets, the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount o f all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price for the Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount and the offer price for any pari passu Indebtedness may be no greater than 100% of the principal amount, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into (or to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds or if the aggregate amount of Notes tendered pursuant to a Notes Offer exceeds the amount of the Net Proceeds so applied, the Trustee will select the Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness, if applicable, to be purchased on a pro rata basis (or in the manner described under "-- Selection and Notice"), based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.
To the extent that any portion of Net Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollar, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in U.S. dollar that is actually received by the Company upon converting such portion of the Net Proceeds into U.S. dollar.
The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, an Asset Sale Offer or a Notes Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control, Asset Sale or Notes Offer provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
Selection and Notice
If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under "--Book-Entry, Delivery and Form," based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. The Trustee shall not be liable for selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.
No Notes of $200,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of the Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.
For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of DTC, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to DTC for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Notes shall also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and, in connection with any redemption, the Company will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.
235

Certain Covenants

Incurrence o f Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the Company will not issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however,

(a)

that the Company may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock, and any

Guarantor may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue preferred stock, if on the date on

which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or such preferred stock is issued,

as the case may be, if the Company's Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company's most recently ended

four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date

on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or such preferred stock is

issued, as the case may be, would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0;

(b)

if such Indebtedness to be incurred is Secured Indebtedness, the Company and any Guarantor may incur

such Secured Indebtedness if the Company's Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio for the

Company's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are

available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Secured Indebtedness is incurred would

have been less than 4.0 to 1.0; and

(c)

if such Indebtedness to be incurred is First Lien Secured Indebtedness, the Company and any Guarantor

may incur such First Lien Secured Indebtedness if the Company's Consolidated First Lien Secured

Leverage Ratio for the Company's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial

statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional First Lien Secured

Indebtedness is incurred would have been less than 2.5 to 1.0,

in each case determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or the preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

the Company or any o f its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue Date to permanently repay any

Indebtedness under a Credit Facility and effect a corresponding commitment reduction thereunder pursuant

paragraph;

(7)

the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of intercompany Indebtedness between or

(20) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (20) not to exceed $40.0 million.

Neither the Company nor any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the relevant Guarantee on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment-ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities, the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

For purposes of determining compliance with this "Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Indebtedness described in this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, and from time to time to reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant, provided that Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt may not be reclassified. Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided in clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt.

The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. Dollar-Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided, however, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated in non-U.S. dollar currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in U.S. dollars will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the U.S. Dollar-Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the U.S. Dollar- Equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally incurred, except that to the extent that:

(1)

such U.S. Dollar-Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in

which case the refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence; and

(2)

the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness

being refinanced, in which case the U.S. Dollar-Equivalent of such excess will be determined on the date

such refinancing Indebtedness is being incurred.

For purposes of determining compliance with any ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of this covenant for any purpose for which a ratio is tested under the Indenture, the SEK-Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred; provided, however, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated in non-SEK currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement with respect to SEK, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in SEK will be
239

calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the SEK-Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the SEK-Equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally incurred, except that to the extent that:

(1)

such SEK-Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in which case

the refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence; and

(2)

the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness

being refinanced, in which case the SEK - Equivalent of such excess will be determined on the date such

refinancing Indebtedness is being incurred.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(1)

in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability in respect

thereof determined in accordance with IFRS;

(2)

the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

(3)

in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the

lesser of:

(i)

the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(ii) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.

Restricted Payments

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1)

declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the Company's or any

of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection

direct or indirect holders of the Company's or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests in their

the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), except (i) a payment of interest or principal at the

Stated Maturity thereof or (ii) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of Indebtedness purchased in

anticipation of satisfying a scheduled sinking fund obligation, principal installment or scheduled maturity,

in each case due within one year of the date of such purchase, repurchase or other acquisition;

(4)

make any cash payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire

for value any Subordinated Shareholder Debt; or

240

(5)

(a)

no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such

Restricted Payment;

(b)

the Company would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro form a effect thereto as if

such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, have been

permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio

test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption "--Incurrence of

Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock"; and

(c)

such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the

Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue Date (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by

clauses (2), (3), (5), (6), (7), (10), (11), (12), (14) and (15) of the next succeeding paragraph) and together

with Permitted Investments permitted by clause (18) of the definition thereof made by the Company and its

Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue Date (and not repaid or refunded), is less than the sum, without

duplication, of:

(i)

50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Company for the period (taken as one accounting

period) from the beginning of the fiscal quarter commencing immediately after the Issue Date to

the end of the Company's most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial

statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net

Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit); plus

(ii)

100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the Fair Market Value of marketable securities

received by the Company since the Issue Date as a contribution to its common equity capital or

or exchangeable debt securities of the Company, in each case that have been converted into or

exchanged for Equity Interests of the Company (other than Equity Interests and convertible or

exchangeable Disqualified Stock or debt securities sold to a Subsidiary of the Company) or from

the issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Debt (other than an issuance or sale to a

Subsidiary of the Company); plus

(iii) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the Issue Date is (a) sold, disposed of or otherwise cancelled, liquidated or repaid, 100% of the aggregate amount received in cash and the Fair Market Value of the property and marketable securities received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than from a Person that is the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), or (b) made in an entity that subsequently becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Investment of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of the date such entity becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; plus

(iv) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company designated as such after the Issue Date is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged or consolidated into the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or all of the assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary are transferred to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, the Fair Market Value of the property received by the Company or Restricted Subsidiary or the Company's Restricted Investment in such Subsidiary as of the date of such redesignation, merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, to the extent such Investments reduced the Restricted Payments capacity under this clause (c) and were not previously repaid or otherwise reduced; plus

(v)

upon the full and unconditional release of a Restricted Investment that is a guarantee made by the

Company or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person, an amount equal to the amount of

such guarantee; plus

241

(vi) 100% of any cash dividends or distributions received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent that such dividends or distributions were not otherwise included in the Consolidated Net Income of the Company for such period.

(1)

the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any redemption within 60 days after the date of

concurrent contribution of common equity capital to the Company; provided that the amount of any such

The Company will not and will not cause or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind securing Indebtedness upon any of their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, except (1) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral (a) Permitted Liens, or (b) if such Lien is not a Permitted Lien, to the extent that all payments due under the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees are secured on an equal and ratable basis (or in the case of Indebtedness which is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantees, prior or senior thereto, with the same relative priority as the Notes or such Guarantee, as applicable, shall have with respect to such subordinated Indebtedness) with the obligations so secured until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien and (2) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Certain jurisdictions do not recognize "second-priority" liens. In such jurisdictions, the Notes and Guarantees will be secured by the first- priority liens granted to the creditors in respect of certain first-priority lien obligations, but the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement will seek to effectively subordinate the secured claims of the Notes and Guarantees on a basis consistent with the second-priority lien provisions described herein and will provide that any recoveries on such liens will be applied to the first- priority-lien obligations before application to the Notes.

Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1)

pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Company or any Restricted

Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any

Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2)

make loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(3)

sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,

provided that (x) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill period to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(1)

agreements governing Indebtedness and Credit Facilities as in effect on the Issue Date and any

amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings

of those agreements; provided that the amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements,

244

refundings, replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the Issue Date;

(2)

the Indenture, the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Mezzanine

Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes (including Additional Notes), the Guarantees, the Revolving Credit

(3)

any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any Indebtedness

permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described

under "--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" if the encumbrances and restrictions

contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the

holders of the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility

Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Parallel Intercreditor

Agreement and the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date (as

determined in good faith by the Company) or (ii) is customary in comparable financings (as determined in

good faith by the Company);

(4)

applicable law, rule, regulation or order or the terms of any license, authorization, concession or permit;

(5)

any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by the Company or any of its

Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness or

Capital Stock was incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which

encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other

than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case of

Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred;

(6)

customary non-assignment and similar provisions in contracts, leases and licenses entered into in the

ordinary course of business;

(7)

purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business and Capital Lease

Obligations that impose restrictions on the property purchased or leased of the nature described in

clause (3) of the preceding paragraph;

and assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary pending its

sale or other disposition;

(9)

Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing

such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those

contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;

(10) Liens permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described above under the caption "-- Liens" that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;

(11) customary provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements in the ordinary course of business (including agreements entered into in connection with a Restricted Investment), which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements;

(12) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or suppliers or required by insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case, under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing under any agreement that extends, renews, refinances or replaces the agreements containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing clauses (1) through (12), or in this clause (13); provided that the terms and conditions of any such encumbrances or restrictions are no

245

more restrictive in any material respect than those under or pursuant to the agreement so extended, renewed, refinanced or replaced;

(14) any Qualified Securitization Financing; and

(15) any mortgage financing or mortgage refinancing that imposes restrictions only on the real property securing such Indebtedness.

States or the District of Columbia;

(2)

the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger with the Company (if other than the

Company) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition

has been made assumes all the obligations of the Company under the Indenture, the Notes, the Parallel

Intercreditor Agreement, the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement, and any Additional Intercreditor

Agreement, if any, pursuant to the terms thereof;

(3)

immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;

(4)

the Company or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the

Company), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been

made would, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing

transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period (i) be

permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio

test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption "--Incurrence of

Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" or (ii) have a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio no less than it

was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(5)

the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel, in each case, stating

that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture comply with this covenant;

provided that in giving an opinion of counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to any matters

of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (3) and (4) above.

A Guarantor (other than any Guarantor whose Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation), or (2) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of such Guarantor and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(1)

immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(2)

either:

(a)

the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or

surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of that Guarantor under the

Indenture, the Security Documents, the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement, the Mezzanine

Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, if any, on terms satisfactory

to the Trustee; or

246

(b)

the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable

provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Company will not, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of the properties and assets of it and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to any other Person.

Transactions with Affiliates

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company (each, an "Affiliate Transaction") involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $6.5 million, unless:

(1)

the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted

Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such

Restricted Subsidiary with a Person who is not an Affiliate; and

(2)

the Company delivers to the Trustee:

(a)

with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving

aggregate consideration in excess of $20.0 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the

Company set forth in an Officer's Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies

with this covenant and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the

disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Company; and, in addition;

(b)

with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving

aggregate consideration in excess of $40.0 million, an opinion of an accounting, appraisal or

investment banking firm of international standing, or other recognized independent expert of

international standing with experience in appraising the terms and conditions of the type of

transaction or series of related transactions for which an opinion is required, stating that the

transaction or series of related transactions is (i) fair from a financial point of view taking into

account all relevant circumstances or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have been

obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's length basis from a Person who is

not an Affiliate.

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:

(1)

(9)

the incurrence of any Subordinated Shareholder Debt;

(10) transactions pursuant to, or contemplated by any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and transactions pursuant to any amendment, modification or extension to such agreement, so long as such amendment, modification or extension, taken as a whole, is not more disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in any material respect than the original agreement as in effect on the Issue Date;

(11) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture that are fair to the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person;

(12) any payments or other transactions pursuant to a tax sharing agreement between the Company and any other Person or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and any other Person with which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries files a consolidated tax return or with which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is part of a group for tax purposes or any tax advantageous group contribution made pursuant to applicable legislation; provided, however, that any such tax sharing or arrangement and payment does not permit or require payments in excess of the amounts of tax that would be payable by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand- alone basis;

(17) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing.

248

Designation o f Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries
The Board of Directors of the Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary (including any newly acquired or newly formed Restricted Subsidiary) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption "--Restricted Payments" or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Company may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer's Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption "--Restricted Payments." If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption "--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock," the Company will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption "-- Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock," calculated on a pro form a basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
Maintenance o f Listing
The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Company is unable to obtain admission to listing of the Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or if at any time the Company determines that it will not so list or maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such Notes on another "recognized stock exchange" as defined in §1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom.
Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness
The Company will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee the payment of any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental Indenture to the Indenture providing for the guarantee of the payment of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Guarantee will be pari passu with or senior to such Restricted Subsidiary's guarantee of such other Indebtedness and if such other Indebtedness is secured by a First-Priority Lien, then such Guarantee may have such features as the other Guarantees of the Notes under the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement.
Each additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to any Guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary (1) existing on the Issue Date or (2) given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less than 250.0 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee was given, of at least A or the equivalent thereof by S&P and at least A2 or the equivalent thereof by Moody's, in connection with the operation of cash management programs established for the benefit of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.
249

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the payment of the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in:

(1)

a violation of applicable law, which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through

measures reasonably available to the Company or the Restricted Subsidiary; or

(2)

any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary.

Paymentsfor Consent

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of the Notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes, to exclude holders of Notes in any jurisdiction where (i) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (ii) the payment of the consideration therefor would require the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its member states), which the Company in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) (A) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (B) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

Limitation on Activities o f the Company

Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indenture:

(1)

the Company will not engage in any business activity or undertake any other activity, except any activity

(i) reasonably relating to the incurrence, offering, sale, issuance and servicing, purchase, redemption,

amendment, exchange, refinancing or retirement of the Notes or other Indebtedness (or any item

specifically excluded from the definition of Indebtedness) permitted by the terms of the Indenture

(including activities reasonably incidental thereto, including performance of the terms and conditions of

such Indebtedness (or items that are specifically excluded from the definition of Indebtedness) to the extent

such activities are otherwise permissible under the Indenture) and the granting of Liens permitted under the

covenant described above under the caption "--Liens"; (ii) undertaken with the purpose of, and directly

related to, fulfilling its obligations or exercising its rights under the Notes, the Indenture, other

Indebtedness permitted by the terms of the Indenture (or any item specifically excluded from the definition

of Indebtedness), any Security Document to which it is a party or the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement, the

Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into pursuant to the

terms of the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture), or any other document relating to the Notes

(including any Additional Notes); (iii) involving the provision of administrative, managerial, legal and

accounting services (including treasury services and cash pooling arrangements) to its Subsidiaries of a

type customarily provided by a holding company to its Subsidiaries and the receipt of any amounts related

thereto to the extent expressly permitted under the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement, the Mezzanine

Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into pursuant to the terms of

the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture); (iv) making Investments in the Notes or

Indebtedness permitted under Indenture; (v) reasonably related to the owning of the assets listed in

clause (2) of this covenant and the performance of the terms of the Vencorex JV Agreements; (vi) directly

related or reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of the Company's corporate

existence, the acquisition, holding or disposition of assets permitted to be held by it under the Indenture or

reasonably related to its function as an intermediate holding company (including any transaction otherwise

permitted under the Indenture related to the distribution or sale of the Singapore Entities to a Parent Entity

or third party); or (vii) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are de minimis in nature; and

250

(2)

the Company shall not own any assets or property other than the Equity Interests of Perstorp Butenderivat

AB, up to 6% of the Equity Interests of Perstorp Holding GmbH, the Equity Interests of Vencorex and the

Singapore Entities, receivables in respect of intercompany Indebtedness to Perstorp Butenderivat AB,

Investments in the form of loans to Vencorex or its subsidiaries and Investments in the Singapore Entities,

in each case to the extent such Investment is otherwise permitted under the Indenture, any vendor loan to a

Parent Entity in connection the distribution or sale of the Singapore Entities to a Parent Entity in a

transaction otherwise permitted under the Indenture, cash and Cash Equivalents and other assets reasonably

related to the provision of treasury services and cash pooling arrangements, and other assets that are de

minimis in nature; provided that the Company may from time to time receive in a transaction otherwise

permitted under the Indenture and the Security Documents, properties and assets (including cash, Cash

Equivalents, Temporary Cash Investments, shares of Capital Stock of another Person and/or Indebtedness

and other obligations) for the purpose of transferring such properties and assets to any Parent Entity, any

Subsidiary or any other Person, so long as in any case such further transfer is made promptly by the

Company and, after giving effect thereto, the Company is again in compliance with this clause.

Impairment of Security Interest

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of Notes and the Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement and (b) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted Collateral Liens; and providedfurther, however, that no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced, or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, renewal or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the assets), the Company delivers to the Trustee either (1) a solvency opinion from an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee confirming the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, (2) a certificate from the board of directors or chief financial officer of the relevant Person (acting in good faith) that confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, replacement, supplement, modification or release, or (3) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes created under the Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced or released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, and that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking.

At the direction of the Company and without the consent of the holder of Notes, the Security Agent may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security Documents to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (ii) (but subject to compliance with the foregoing paragraph) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens, (iii) add to the Collateral or (iv) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of Notes in any material respect.

In the event that the Company complies with this covenant, the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, as applicable, shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release with no need for instructions from the holders of the Notes.

Further Assurances

The Company will, and will procure that each of its Subsidiaries will at its own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may reasonably require (i) for registering any Security
251

Documents in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security Documents and (ii) if such Security Documents have become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Documents and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of those assets. The Company will, and will procure that each of its Subsidiaries will execute all transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give all notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may reasonably request.
Parallel Intercreditor Agreement

At the request of the Company, at the time of, or prior to, the incurrence of any Indebtedness that is permitted to share the Collateral or that is otherwise permitted to be incurred under the Indenture, the Company and the Security Agent will (without the consent of holders of the Notes) enter into an additional intercreditor agreement (each an "Additional Intercreditor Agreem ent') on terms substantially similar to the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement (or on terms more favorable to the holders of the Notes) or an amendment to or an amendment and restatement of the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement (which amendment does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Notes).

The Indenture will provide that each holder of a Note, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of each of the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreement and any amendment referred to in the preceding paragraph and none of the Company, the Trustee or the Security Agent will be required to seek the consent of any holders of Notes to perform its obligations under and in accordance with this covenant. At the request of the Company, the Trustee and the Security Agent will execute any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or amendment or amendment and restatement of the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement that complies with the provisions of this covenant.

(1)

the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

clause (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under "--Merger, Consolidation or Sale of

Assets";

(6)

"--Transactions with Affiliates";

(7)

"--Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness"; and

(8)

"--Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries."

Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to the actions of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Period; provided that (1) with respect to the Restricted Payments made after any such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant

252

described under the caption "--Restricted Payments" had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period and (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the caption "--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock." Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Period, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

If the Company has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Subsidiaries are Significant Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS.

The Company will, either (i) within ten Business Days after the delivery of each report discussed in clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, conduct a conference call to discuss such report and answer questions about such report, which conference call will be open to all Noteholders or (ii) provide holders of the Notes with access to and the opportunity to participate in any public conference call, investor presentation, webcast or other event, the primary purpose of which is to discuss results of operations or any material event referenced in clause (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant with investors in the Capital Stock of the Company. Details of such conference calls will either (x) be delivered with each report or (y) posted on an electronic website that is used by the Company to communicate to the equity holders generally for which the Noteholders have been, prior to the posting of such notice, informed of the website address and relevant password specifications, which notice shall constitute reasonable notice of such public calls for the purpose of this paragraph.

In addition, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Company has agreed that it will furnish to the holders of the Notes and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.

The Company will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant (i) on the Company's website and (ii) if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, at the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent in London.

Significant Subsidiary (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company, any Guarantor or any

Significant Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue

Date, if that default:

(a)

is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, such Indebtedness at

the Stated Maturity thereof prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such

Indebtedness on the date of such default (a "Payment Default"); or

(b)

results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity; or

(c)

results in the delivery by any creditor under the Mezzanine Facility Agreement of an Enforcement

Standstill Notice (as defined in the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement as in effect on the Issue

Date) to the Creditor Representatives of the Senior Debt (each, as defined in the Mezzanine

Intercreditor Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date) and the lapse of 60 days after such

delivery, in which period such Enforcement Standstill Notice has not been waived or withdrawn

and the default in respect of which such Enforcement Standstill Notice was served has not been

and, in each case, the principal amount o f any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount o f any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $25.0 million or more;

(6)

Security Documents), or an assertion by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that any

Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of $13.0 million is not subject to a valid, perfected security

interest (except as permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Parallel

Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement); or (ii) the repudiation by the

Company o f any o f its material obligations under the Security Documents;

Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.

Remedies under the Indenture

In the case o f an Event o f Default specified in clause (9) above, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice; provided that, the amount due and payable shall be equal to the aggregate gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may and, i f directed by holders o f at least 25% in aggregate principal amount o f the then outstanding Notes, the Trustee shall, declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.

255

Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except (subject to the provisions described under "--Amendment, Supplement and Waiver") to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1)

such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2)

holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested the

Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3)

such holders have offered the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, security and/or indemnity satisfactory

to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4)

the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer

of security and/or indemnity; and

(5)

holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the

Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding may, on behalf of the holders of all outstanding Notes, waive any past default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of premium, if any, any Additional Amounts or interest on any Note held by a non-consenting holder (which may only be waived with the consent of each holder of the Notes affected).

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture.

The Parallel Intercreditor Agreement places certain restrictions on the voting rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to an enforcement action in respect of the Collateral. For further details, see "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Parallel Intercreditor Agreement--Limitations on enforcement."

No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any Guarantor, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of the Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under applicable securities laws.

Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance

The Company may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officer's Certificate elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes and all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Guarantees ("Legal Defeasance") except for:

(1)

the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest

(including Additional Amounts) or premium, if any, on, such Notes when such payments are due from the

trust referred to below;

256

(2)

the Company's obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of

Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment

and money for security payments held in trust;

(3)

the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Company's and the Guarantors'

obligations in connection therewith; and

(4)

the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time elect to have the obligations of the Company and the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation to make Change of Control Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Indenture ("Covenant Defeasance") and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all Events of Default described under "--Events of Default and Remedies" (except those relating to payments on the Notes or, solely with respect to the Company, bankruptcy or insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1)

the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes,

cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars

and non-callable U.S. Government Obligations in each case, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion

of an internationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants,

to pay the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts and premium, if any) on the outstanding

Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and

the Company must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a

particular redemption date;

(2)

in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company must deliver to the Trustee an opinion reasonably acceptable

to the Trustee of United States counsel confirming that (a) the Company has received from, or there has

been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a

change in the applicable U.S. Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon

such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income,

gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject

to tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such

Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3)

in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company must deliver to the Trustee an opinion acceptable to the

Trustee of United States counsel confirming that the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize

income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will

be subject to U.S. Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as

would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4)

the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by

the Company with the intent of preferring the holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Company

with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Company or others; and

(5)

the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel, subject to

customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal

Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

Amendment, Supplement and Waiver

Except as provided otherwise in the succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement, the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement, the Mezzanine
257

Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).

Unless (i) consented to by the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or (ii) consented to by each holder of the Notes adversely affected thereby (in each case including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), an amendment, supplement or waiver may not:

(1)

reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2)

reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the

redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described above under the caption

"--Repurchase at the Option of Holders");

(3)

reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Note;

(4)

impair the right of any holder of the Notes to receive payment of principal of and interest on such holder's

Notes on or after the due dates therefore or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with

respect to such holder's Notes or any Guarantee in respect thereof;

(5)

waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or

that resulted from such acceleration);

(6)

make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;

holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or premium, if any,

covenants described above under the caption "--Repurchase at the Option of Holders");

(9)

change the ranking of the Notes or any Guarantees;

(10) release any Collateral granted for the benefit of the holders of Notes, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(11) release any Guarantor from any of its Obligations under its Guarantee or the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement; or

(12) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of the Notes, the Company, the Trustee, the Security Agent (as applicable and to the extent each is a party to the relevant document) may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantee, the Security Documents, the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement, the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement:

(1)

to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

(2)

to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(3)

to provide for the assumption of the Company's or a Guarantor's obligations to holders of Notes and

Guarantees in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's or

such Guarantor's assets, as applicable;

258

(4)

to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Notes or that does

not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such holder in any material respect;

(5)

to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Notes or the Guarantees to any provision

of this "Description of the Second Lien Notes" to the extent that such provision in this "Description of the

(10) to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Guarantee with respect to the Notes; or

(11) to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee under the Indenture.
The consent of the holders of Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an opinion of counsel and an Officer's Certificate.

Satisfaction and Discharge

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder when:

(1)

either:

(a)

all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been

replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter

repaid to the Company, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b)

all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable

by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable

within one year and the Company or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be

deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders, cash in U.S.

dollars, non-callable U.S Government Obligations, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and

non-callable U.S Government Obligations, in each case, in amounts as will be sufficient, without

consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the

Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium and Additional

Amounts, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;

(2)

the Company or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture;

and

(3)

be.

In addition, the Company must deliver an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

259

Judgment Currency
Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in U.S. dollars which is made to or for the account of any holder of the Notes or the Trustee in lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the "Judgment Currency"), whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the liquidation of the Company or any Guarantor, shall constitute a discharge of the Company or the Guarantor's obligation under the Indenture, the Notes, and the Guarantees, as the case may be, only to the extent of the amount of U.S. dollars with such holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, could purchase in the London foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Judgment Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first Business Day following receipt of the payment in the Judgment Currency. If the amount of U.S. dollars that could be so purchased is less than the amount of U.S. dollars originally due to such holder of the Notes or the Trustee, as the case may be, the Company and the Guarantors shall indemnify and hold harmless the holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, from and against all loss or damage arising out of, or as a result of, such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in the Indenture or the Notes, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any holder of the Notes or the Trustee from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.
Concerning the Trustee
The Company shall deliver written notice to the Trustee within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default. If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Company or any Guarantor, the Indenture limits the right of the Trustee to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee.
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of the Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security, and the Trustee has received, and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.
The Company and the Guarantors will indemnify the Trustee for certain claims, liabilities and expenses incurred without fraud, negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with its duties.

Governing Law
The Indenture and the Notes and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to applicable principles of conflicts of law to the
260

extent that the application of the laws of another jurisdiction would be required thereby. The Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement is and the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by the laws of England and Wales.

Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process

The Indenture will provide that the Company and each Guarantor (other than any Guarantor incorporated in the United States) will appoint an agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City of New York and will submit to such jurisdiction.

Enforceability of Judgments

Substantially all of the assets of the Company and the non-U.S. Guarantors are outside the United States. As a result, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Company or any such Guarantor may not be collectable within the United States. See "Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities."
