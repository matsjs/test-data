Where a claim relating to the information contained in this Prospectus is brought before a court in a Member State o f the European Economic Area, the plaintiff may, under the national legislation o f the Member State where the claim is brought, be required to bear the costs o f translating the Prospectus before the legal proceedings are initiated.
Overview
Talvivaara is an internationally significant base metals producer with its primary focus on nickel and zinc. Talvivaara's main asset is the Talvivaara mine in Sotkamo, Finland. The Talvivaara polymetallic deposits, Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi, comprise one of the largest known sulphide nickel resources in Europe. The classified mineral resources are currently estimated by Talvivaara at 1,550 million tonnes of ore, of which 1,121 million tonnes are in measured and indicated categories.
The Guarantor, which holds the exclusive rights to mine the Talvivaara deposits, is the sole operative subsidiary of the Issuer and carries out the mining and mineral activities at the Talvivaara mine. The Issuer's ownership in the Guarantor is 84 per cent and the remaining 16 per cent is owned by Outokumpu Mining Oy ("Outokumpu Mining").
Talvivaara started its operations in the Talvivaara mine in 2008 and produced its first commercial quantities of nickel sulphide in February 2009. Following this, Talvivaara has focused on ramping up its production. As by-products of the mine, Talvivaara produces zinc and cobalt and also expects to produce copper starting in 2012. In addition, in February 2010, Talvivaara announced its plan to recover uranium in the form of uranium oxide as a by-product. The Finnish Government granted the requested license under the Finnish Nuclear Energy Act on 1 March 2012. However, the application for an environmental permit is pending as at the date of this Prospectus.
Talvivaara supplies metal intermediates, such as mixed nickel cobalt sulphide, zinc sulphide and copper sulphide, to companies with metal refining operations. Talvivaara has entered into a 10-year off-take agreement with Norilsk Nickel Harjavalta Oy ("Norilsk Nickel") for the entire output of the Talvivaara mine's nickel and cobalt production at market prices. In January 2010, Talvivaara Sotkamo entered into a zinc in concentrate streaming agreement (the "Zinc in Concentrate Streaming Agreement") with Nyrstar Sales & Marketing NV and Nyrstar NV (together, "Nyrstar") for the delivery of its entire zinc in concentrate production to Nyrstar until a total of 1.25 million tonnes of zinc in concentrate has been delivered. Further, Talvivaara Sotkamo entered into a uranium off-take agreement with Cameco Corporation ("Cameco") in February 2011.
Talvivaara develops the Talvivaara deposits using technology known as bioheapleaching. This technology harnesses locally occurring, live bacteria for the extraction of metals from ore. During the last few years, Talvivaara has demonstrated the viability of using bioheapleaching technology for the extraction of nickel from the Talvivaara ore. The Talvivaara ore body is well suited to open-pit mining due to thin overburden, favourable resource geometry and a low waste to ore ratio. The ore is of a relatively low grade (0.22 per cent nickel), but is well suited to bioheapleaching due to its high sulphide content and low pH, which enables rapid leaching and reduces the need for chemical catalysis.
In 2011, Talvivaara produced 16,087 tonnes of nickel and 31,815 tonnes of zinc. For the year ended 31 December 2011, its net sales were EUR 231.2 million. Talvivaara had 461 employees as at 31 December 2011.

Yleistä
Talvivaara on kansainvälisesti merkittävä perusmetallien tuottaja, joka keskittyy ensisijaisesti nikkelin ja sinkin tuotantoon. Talvivaaran tärkein resurssi on Talvivaaran kaivos Sotkamossa. Talvivaaran monimetalliset esiintymät, Kuusilampi ja Kolmisoppi, muodostavat yhden Euroopan suurimmista tiedossa olevista sulfidisen nikkelin esiintymistä. Luokitellut mineraalivarannot ovat Talvivaaran tämänhetkisen arvion mukaan 1 550 miljoonaa tonnia malmia, josta 1 121 miljoonaa tonnia on todetut ja todennäköiset -kategoriassa.
Takaaja, jolla on yksinomainen oikeus hyödyntää Talvivaaran esiintymää, on Liikkeeseenlaskijan ainoa operatiivinen tytäryhtiö ja se harjoittaa kaivos- ja kaivannaistoimintaa Talvivaaran kaivoksella. Liikkeeseenlaskijan omistusosuus Takaajassa on 84 prosenttia ja jäljelle jäävän 16 prosenttia omistaa Outokumpu Mining Oy ("Outokumpu Mining").
Talvivaara aloitti toimintansa Talvivaaran kaivoksella vuonna 2008 ja tuotti ensimmäiset kaupalliset nikkelisulfidieränsä helmikuussa 2009. Tämän jälkeen Talvivaara on keskittynyt tuotantonsa ylösajoon. Kaivoksen sivutuotteina Talvivaara tuottaa sinkkiä ja kobolttia, ja se odottaa myös tuottavansa kuparia vuodesta 2012 lähtien. Lisäksi Talvivaara julkisti helmikuussa 2010 suunnitelmansa ottaa talteen sivutuotteena saatavaa uraania uraanioksidin muodossa. Valtioneuvosto myönsi 1.3.2012 ydinenergialaissa vaaditun luvan, mutta ympäristölupahakemus on vireillä tämän esitteen päivämääränä.
Talvivaara tuottaa metallinjalostusyrityksille metallipuolituotteita, kuten nikkelikobolttisulfidia, sinkkisulfidia ja kuparisulfidia. Talvivaara on tehnyt Norilsk Nickel Harjavalta Oy:n ("Norilsk Nickel") kanssa 10-vuotisen, markkinahintoihin perustuvan myynti- ja ostosopimuksen Talvivaaran kaivoksen koko nikkeli- ja kobolttituotannosta. Tammikuussa 2010 Talvivaara Sotkamo teki sinkkituotantoaan koskevan tuotevirtasopimuksen ("Sinkkituotantoa koskeva tuotevirtasopimus") Nyrstar Sales & Marketing NV:n ja Nyrstar NV:n (yhdessä "Nyrstar") kanssa. Sinkkituotantoa koskevan tuotevirtasopimuksen ehtojen mukaisesti Talvivaara toimittaa koko sinkkituotantonsa Nyrstarille, kunnes 1 250 000 tonnia sinkkiä on toimitettu. Lisäksi Talvivaara Sotkamo teki helmikuussa 2011 Cameco Corporationin ("Cameco") kanssa uraanin myynti- ja ostosopimuksen.
Talvivaara kehittää Talvivaaran esiintymää biokasaliuotusteknologian avulla. Teknologiassa hyödynnetään kotoperäistä elävää bakteerikantaa metallien erottamiseksi malmista. Viime vuosina Talvivaara on osoittanut biokasaliuotusteknologian käyttökelpoisuuden nikkelin erottamisessa Talvivaaran malmista. Talvivaaran malmivaranto soveltuu hyvin avolouhintaan ohuen irtomaakerroksen, resurssien suotuisan geometrian ja alhaisen sivukivi-malmisuhteen ansiosta. Talvivaaran malmin metallipitoisuus on suhteellisen matala (0,22 prosenttia nikkeliä), mutta se sopii hyvin biokasaliuotukseen, sillä korkea sulfidipitoisuus ja matala pH mahdollistavat nopean liuotuksen ja vähentävät kemiallisen katalyysin tarvetta.
Vuonna 2011 Talvivaara tuotti 16 087 tonnia nikkeliä ja 31 815 tonnia sinkkiä ja sen liikevaihto 31.12.2011 päättyneellä tilikaudella oli 231,2 miljoona euroa. Talvivaaralla oli 31.12.2011 461 työntekijää.

RISK FACTORS
An investment in the Notes involves a number o f risks, many o f which are inherent to Talvivaara 's business and could be significant. Investors considering an investment in the Notes should carefully review the information contained in this Prospectus and, in particular, the risk factors described below. Should one or more o f the risk factors described herein materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results o f operations. The following description o f risk factors is based on information known and assessed on the date o f this Prospectus and, therefore, the description o f the risks facing Talvivaara is not necessarily exhaustive. Talvivaara also faces many o f the risks inherent to the mining industry and additional risks not currently known or not currently deemed material may also impair Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results o f operations. The market price o f the Notes could decline due to the realization o f these risks, and investors could lose a part or all o f their investment. Potential investors should note that the order in which the risk factors are presented does not reflect the probability o f their realization or order o f importance.
A s the Guarantor is the sole operative subsidiary o f the Issuer and carries out the mining and mineral activities at the Talvivaara mine, the riskfactors relating to the business and operations o f Talvivaara also apply to the Guarantor.
Commodity Prices and Demand
The market price of nickel, and to a lesser extent zinc, copper and cobalt, together with production volumes are the main factors affecting Talvivaara's financial performance. Accordingly, significant fluctuations in the prices of products sold by Talvivaara impact its financial performance. The market price of nickel has historically been volatile, and Talvivaara believes that this is likely to continue, driven by factors such as shifts in the supply-demand balance, macroeconomic indicators, variations in currency exchange rates, the availability and costs of substitutes, the inventory levels maintained by producers and others and actions of participants in the commodities markets. In recent years, nickel prices have been largely driven by demand from China, which is also affected by Chinese government policy. For the year ended 31 December 2011, nickel-cobalt sulphide sales represented approximately 90 per cent of the Group's revenues; therefore, variations in nickel prices have a direct and significant effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, since February 2010, Talvivaara has not hedged against fluctuations in commodity prices and is, therefore, directly exposed to movements in the market prices of the metals it produces.
Operational Ramp-up
As at the date of this Prospectus, the Talvivaara mine is in the production stage. However, the ramp-up of production still continues, and reaching the targeted production volumes within the estimated timeframe depends on many factors, such as recovery rates and the leaching rate of metals in bioheapleaching, the sufficiency and reliability of the production equipment used in the various processes of production (in the mine, materials handling, bioheapleaching and the metals recovery plant) and the ability to manage the production processes as planned. For example, Talvivaara decided to lower its nickel production target due to unsatisfactory availability of the metals recovery plant in the first quarter of 2011 and certain capacity-limiting bottlenecks identified at the plant. The nickel production target for 2011 was further lowered in the third quarter of 2011 to a minimum of 16,000 tonnes due to problems with the hydrogen sulphide generators. Talvivaara's production target for 2012 is between 25,000 and 30,000 tonnes of nickel and between 50,000 and 60,000 tonnes of zinc. If the planned production volumes cannot be reached with existing equipment and processes, additional investments may be required and the schedule for achieving the targeted production volumes may be delayed, or the targeted production volumes may not be reached at all. Any deviation from the planned ramp-up schedule could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations. The rate of ramp-up is still subject to a number of risks, including various technical and operational risks that may currently be unknown to or beyond the control of Talvivaara. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the operational ramp-up can be completed as currently anticipated, that operations will achieve the anticipated production volumes or that the costs in developing the deposits will be in line with those currently anticipated.
Concentrated Customer Base
Talvivaara has entered into long-term agreements to sell its entire nickel and cobalt production to Norilsk Nickel and its entire zinc production to Nyrstar as discussed in more detail in "Business o f Talvivaara--Material Agreements". A long term off-take agreement has also been concluded with Cameco for the contemplated uranium concentrate production. Although long-term sales agreements mitigate the demand risk, they also expose Talvivaara to counterparty risk if the contract parties do not fulfil their commitments. If any of Talvivaara's contract parties were to unexpectedly terminate their agreement with Talvivaara or failed to abide by the agreement, there can be no assurance that sales would not be delayed or disrupted until alternative customers could be found, or that arrangements with alternative customers could be entered into on terms comparable to the current agreements. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations.
9

Technology and Intellectual Property Rights
Talvivaara is the first company in the world to apply bioheapleaching technology to the recovery of nickel. The Group has already demonstrated that the process works at the Talvivaara mine, but the final recovery rates of nickel and other metals on an industrial scale are still unknown. If the final recovery rates or the leaching rate for the process deviate substantially from Talvivaara's current estimates, it could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations. Although Talvivaara seeks to minimise this risk proactively through process developments and additional studies, the final recovery rates and the leaching cannot be confirmed until 2013 at the earliest, when the ore stacked in the early stages of production in 2008 is expected to reach the final leaching stage.
Talvivaara does not currently have any registered intellectual property rights related to the bioheapleaching technology, and Talvivaara does not consider it likely that this process, which occurs naturally, could be patented. Talvivaara believes that the technology used by Talvivaara does not infringe the rights of any third parties. However, although the bioheapleaching technology is a commonly used technology, especially in the gold and copper mining industries, there can be no assurance that Talvivaara will not be subject to claims that the bioheapleaching technology violates the intellectual property rights of third parties. Any claims of infringement may result in prolonged legal proceedings. If such a claim for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights were made against Talvivaara, it would most likely require Talvivaara to divert significant management time and effort, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, regardless of the outcome of the claim. Defending such litigation would be costly and, if a final judgment of infringement would be rendered against Talvivaara, Talvivaara could be required to pay substantial monetary damages and, unless it would be able to obtain a license, could become subject to substantial limitations or prohibitions regarding its right to use all or part of the disputed technology, which could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations.
Dependence on One Asset
Talvivaara's operations and further development activities concentrate on the Talvivaara mine. In the future, should the mineral production and development activities be materially reduced, interrupted or delayed, Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, minerals exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and is frequently unsuccessful. There can be no assurance that Talvivaara will be able to identify future mineral resources adjacent to the current Talvivaara deposits or elsewhere or to extend the estimated life of operations of the Talvivaara mine. Once mineralisation is discovered, it may take a number of years to complete the geological surveys necessary to assess whether production is possible and, even if production is possible, the economic feasibility of production may change during that time. Any failure by Talvivaara to identify additional mineral resources in the future could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.
Governmental Approvals and Permits
Talvivaara is required by applicable laws and regulations to have various governmental licenses, permits, authorisations and other approvals in order to operate the Talvivaara mine. Talvivaara has the necessary permits for its current operations, but it continues to file additional applications to cover certain specific areas of operations as production is ramped up. In accordance with the terms of Talvivaara's environmental permit, the permit is subject to review by the environmental authorities three years after the commencement of mining activities. Talvivaara filed an application for review of its environmental permit in March 2011 and it expects to obtain the updated permit during 2012. Talvivaara may continue to operate under its permit as before and any changes to its permit would become effective only after the review has been finalised and the decision becomes effective.
Talvivaara submitted an application to the Ministry of Employment and Economy in accordance with the Finnish Mining Act (503/1965, as amended) for the expansion of the Talvivaara mining concession area by approximately 70 square kilometres in June 2011. Subject to approval of such expansion, the total area of the Talvivaara mining concession will be approximately 130 square kilometres. The expansion of the mining concession area relates to the previously announced increase in the Talvivaara mineral resources, the full exploitation of which is not possible within the existing mining concession area. In addition, Talvivaara is also considering further expansion of its production, and conceptual studies relating to the expansion were carried out throughout 2011. The production expansion will require preparation of an environmental impact assessment ("EIA") and submission of an environmental permit application covering the expansion. As at the date of this Prospectus, the preparations for the EIA have been completed and the actual EIA work has started. Talvivaara is planning to submit an environmental permit application in respect of the production expansion during 2012. Further, Talvivaara has applied for an environmental permit to recover uranium in the form of uranium oxide from the solution obtained through the bioheapleaching process. Talvivaara's application to the Ministry of Employment and the Economy for a permit in accordance with the Nuclear Energy Act was filed in April 2010, and Talvivaara obtained such permit on 1 March 2012. However, an appeal against the decision of the Finnish Government has been filed with the Supreme Administrative Court by an organization for environmental protection. The environmental permit application for uranium extraction was submitted to the regional environmental permitting agency
10

in March 2011. Talvivaara has on 3 April 2012 been verbally informed by the regional environmental permitting agency that Talvivaara's environmental permit application for uranium extraction and the review of Talvivaara's environmental permit are to be processed together. The permitting authorities have informed Talvivaara that a decision on the uranium permit will be made during 2012.
Obtaining, maintaining and renewing permits and authorisations required for the operation of a mine is a time-consuming process that may require appeals and additional costs, which may be significant. There can be no assurance about the final outcome or timing of any decisions or potential appeals of such decisions regarding Talvivaara's permits and authorizations. Failure to obtain, maintain or renew necessary permits and authorisations within the anticipated timeframes, or at all, could mean that Talvivaara would be unable to carry on mining operations on the site or would have to change its operations or plans, which could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations.
Extensive Regulation
Mining operations in Finland are subject to extensive regulation. Talvivaara's operations are covered by, among others, laws and regulations relating to environmental protection; management and use of toxic substances and explosives; management of natural resources; exploration; development of mines; production and post-closure reclamation; exports; price controls; taxation; labour standards; and occupational health and safety, including mine safety and historic, cultural and wildlife preservation. The costs associated with compliance with these laws and regulations are substantial and possible future laws and regulations, changes to existing laws and regulations (including the imposition of higher taxes and mining fees) or more stringent enforcement or restrictive interpretation of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspension of the Group's operations and delays in the development of the Talvivaara mine. Moreover, applicable laws and regulations may allow governmental authorities and private parties to bring lawsuits based upon damages to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of the Group's operations, and could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions or damages.
For example, a new Finnish Mining Act (621/2011) became effective on 1 July 2011. A number of material changes were made to practically all stages of a mining project, from prospecting and permitting to operations and the closure of mines. Although the new mining act mostly impacts new mining projects in Finland, existing mines, such as the Talvivaara operations, are also affected to a limited extent. However, Talvivaara estimates that the new Finnish Mining Act has not had and will not have a significant impact on its current operations. As Talvivaara's operations involve the handling and storage of dangerous substances, they are also subject to the Council Directive 96/82/EC of 9 December 1996 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances (the "Seveso II directive"), Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (the "REACH regulation") and Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (the "CLP regulation"). In 2010, Talvivaara registered its products in accordance with the REACH regulation, submitted dossiers for nickel and zinc sulphide to the relevant authorities for registration and compiled the CLP regulation data for all of Talvivaara's substances. As Talvivaara's operations are being ramped up, the cost of compliance with these regulations are expected to increase, and any changes to these regulations could require Talvivaara to make additional investments in its processes. In addition, Finland is a signatory to, and has ratified, the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol is intended to limit or capture emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Although the precise nature of the revised environmental regulations and enforcement regime within these jurisdictions is yet to be finalised, compliance may require the Group to make significant capital expenditures or incur significant expenses and failure to comply with any new legislation could result in the Group incurring fines or other penalties.
Estimates of Mineral Resources
Talvivaara's long-term financial performance is affected by the amount of its estimated mineral resources that can be exploited in an economically profitable manner. The descriptions of mineral resources in this Prospectus constitute estimates of Talvivaara that comply with standard evaluation methods generally approved in the international mining industry and are stated in conformity with Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (the "JORC Code"). See "General Information--Mineral Resource Reporting".
In respect of these estimates, there can be no assurance that the anticipated tonnages and grades will be achieved, that the indicated level of recovery will be realised or that mining and processing will be economically profitable. The actual resources may not conform to geological, metallurgical or other expectations. Lower market prices, increased production costs, reduced recovery rates and other factors may render exploitation of Talvivaara's mineral resources uneconomical and may result in revision of the Group's resource estimates from time to time. The information provided in this Prospectus regarding Talvivaara's mineral resources is not indicative of future production levels or results of operations of Talvivaara. If Talvivaara's actual mineral resources are less than current estimates, it could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations.
11

Availability and Price of Supplies
The most important supplies required in Talvivaara's operations are limestone, burnt lime, caustic soda, elemental sulphur, sulphuric acid and propane. These supplies are all critical for production and are used in large amounts, making it impractical to store reserves that would support operations for more than a few weeks at the mine. Long-term fixed price supply agreements covering limestone, burnt lime and sulphuric acid partly mitigate the Group's exposure to volatility in the prices of raw materials. However, Talvivaara is exposed to price risk, particularly in liquid fuels, caustic soda and elemental sulphur. Failure to negotiate such long-term supply agreements for its supplies could affect the Group's ability to manage the price volatility of raw materials, which could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations. Any disruptions in the availability of supplies or in logistics could result in increased costs for raw materials or production losses, which could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations.
Talvivaara's mining operations also require significant levels of energy, most notably electricity. Although Talvivaara uses hedging and other contractual means to minimise energy price risk whenever possible, volatility in energy prices could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations.
Mining Concessions
Talvivaara Sotkamo has held title to the mining concessions covering the Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi deposits since May 2007, which, under the laws of Finland, require Talvivaara Sotkamo to explore for and exploit mineral reserves in these areas. Mining concessions do not expire; however, they can be terminated under certain limited circumstances by the Ministry of Employment and Economy. Termination of Talvivaara's mining concessions would have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations. Talvivaara is in the process of applying for an extension of the current mining concession area to be used to support the operations of the mine. If granted, the extension would be subject to appeal and there can be no certainty that the extension will be granted or upheld if appealed.
Environmental Hazards
Mining activities are generally subject to environmental hazards as a result of the processes and chemicals used in extraction and production. For example, in late 2010 and early 2011, higher than anticipated concentrations of sulphate and manganese were detected in Talvivaara's discharge waters. With Talvivaara's prompt reaction to the elevated concentrations and cooperation with local authorities to remedy the situation, by December 31, 2011, manganese levels were reduced by 80 per cent and sulphate levels by 50 per cent since early 2011 and permanent damage to the nearby lakes was avoided. Talvivaara continues to focus on further recycling of process waters, optimised consumption of chemicals and research into other technologies and equipment to reduce the discharge levels even further. However, further environmental hazards may exist on Talvivaara's properties or in the areas neighbouring the Talvivaara mine that are currently unknown to it, or may arise irrespective of whether Talvivaara is in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. Talvivaara may be liable for losses associated with such hazards, or may be forced to undertake extensive remedial clean-up action or to pay for governmental remedial clean-up action, even in cases where such hazards have been caused by previous or subsequent owners or operators of the property, past or present owners of adjacent properties or natural conditions. In addition, Finnish authorities may force closure of the mine on a temporary or permanent basis or refuse future mining concession extensions if serious environmental hazards were to be discovered on Talvivaara properties or in the areas neighbouring the Talvivaara mine. Prevailing or perceived environmental hazards and related negative publicity could also impair Talvivaara's reputation. For more information see "Business o f Talvivaara--Regulatory Framework and Rights to the Talvivaara Deposits--Environmental Matters".
Infrastructure
The Talvivaara mine is located in a sparsely populated, sub-Arctic area in Eastern Finland, and Talvivaara's production operations rely on the infrastructure in that area being adequate. Talvivaara depends on trucks and trains for delivery of raw materials and supplies to its operations and trains and ships to transport its products to customers. Electricity for the mine is supplied via a cable owned by Talvivaara that connects the mine to the Vuolijoki substation on the Finnish main grid. Disruptions in transportation services or the power supply because of weather-related problems, failures in key equipment, lockouts or other industrial action or other events could temporarily disrupt Talvivaara's mining operations, impair its ability to receive supplies and supply its products to customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations.
Personnel
Talvivaara's business depends in significant part upon the contributions of a number of key senior management and personnel, in particular its highly skilled team of engineers and geologists. Factors critical to retaining Talvivaara's present personnel and attracting additional highly qualified personnel include Talvivaara's ability to provide these
12

individuals with competitive compensation arrangements. However, there can be no certainty that the services of its key personnel will continue to be available to the Group. A failure by Talvivaara to retain or attract highly qualified individuals in key management positions as well as highly skilled engineers and geologists could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, it may be difficult for Talvivaara to find or hire qualified people in the mining industry who are or will be situated in Finland, to obtain all of the necessary services or expertise locally or to conduct operations on its projects at reasonable rates. If qualified people, services or expertise cannot be obtained locally, they would need to be obtained elsewhere, which could require work permits and compliance with applicable laws, and could result in operational delays and higher costs, which could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations.
Capital Expenditure
The mining business is capital intensive and the development and exploitation of metals reserves and the acquisition of machinery and equipment require substantial capital expenditure. Talvivaara's strategy is initially focused on ramping up annual nickel production to 50,000 tonnes. Although no firm commitments have been made, Talvivaara has continued conceptual studies relating to potential further expansion of its nickel production level, which began in late 2010. The implementation of these plans, to the extent pursued, is expected to involve significant capital expenditure. Subject to receiving all required permits and approvals, Talvivaara plans to recover uranium as a by-product, which would require significant capital expenditures; however, up to U.S.$ 60 million of such expenditures will be covered by its contract partner, Cameco, as discussed in "Business o f Talvivaara--Material Agreements-- Uranium Off-take Agreement". Some of Talvivaara's plans may also require greater investment than currently estimated. There can be no assurance that Talvivaara will be able to reach its targeted production levels and generate sufficient cash flow to finance operations, which may require Talvivaara to obtain additional financing. Such financing may not be available on commercially satisfactory terms, or at all, which may, in turn, delay implementation of Talvivaara's strategy and have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations.
Foreign Exchange Risk
The majority of the Group's incurred and anticipated capital expenditure and nearly all of its operating expenditure are euro denominated. The Group's products (i.e., nickel, zinc, copper and cobalt) are, however, priced in U.S. dollars, exposing the Group to foreign currency risk. The Group's exposure to U.S. dollar risk arises also from U.S. dollar denominated bank accounts and U.S. dollar derivative contracts. Accordingly, the Group's financial results may be affected by exchange rate fluctuations between euro and the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate between euro and the U.S. dollar was volatile throughout 2011 and was impacted by the euro area crisis, particularly towards the end of 2011. Talvivaara has, from time to time, hedged its exposure to the U.S. dollar with the aim of limiting the adverse effects of U.S. dollar weakness and expects to continue to do so in the future. However, if Talvivaara's hedging policy is unsuccessful or if a hedging counterparty were not to perform its obligations, it could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information, see the audited consolidated financial statements of Talvivaara for the years ended and as at 31 December 2011 and 2010 incorporated by reference herein.
Liquidity and Refinancing Risks
Talvivaara's ability to finance its operations depends on a number of factors, including the availability of cash flows from operations and access to additional debt and equity financing, and there can be no assurance that such funds will be available in the future. In addition, certain of Talvivaara's financial instruments and other agreements contain financial commitments and covenants. Failure to comply with these commitments and covenants could reduce the amount of credit available to Talvivaara or accelerate the maturity date of certain loans. There can be no assurance that Talvivaara will be able to incur additional debt or refinance its existing debt on terms that are acceptable to it, or at all.
In addition, the adverse developments in the credit markets, as well as other future adverse developments, such as the further deterioration of the overall financial markets and a worsening of general economic conditions, could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's ability to borrow additional funds as well as the cost and other terms of funding. The failure to obtain sufficient funding for operations or the increased costs or unfavourable terms of financing could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, difficulties that Talvivaara may encounter in financing its capital investments may prevent the realization of its strategic plans and could result in Talvivaara having to forgo opportunities that may arise in the future. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's competitive position. For additional information, see the audited consolidated financial statements of Talvivaara for the years ended and as at 31 December 2011 and 2010 incorporated by reference herein.

Internal Control and Reporting

Talvivaara has grown substantially in a relatively short period of time. The increasing operating complexity of Talvivaara's business and the responsibilities of its management have increased as a result of this growth, placing additional demands and, from time to time, significant strain on its managerial, operational and control systems. If the control systems and the related internal controls do not detect erroneous actions, the reliability of Talvivaara's internal and external reporting may be impaired, which may, in turn, have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations as well as on communications and reputation.

Business of Mining

Mining business is subject to risks and hazards, many of which are outside Talvivaara's control. These risks include, among others, environmental hazards (including discharges of metals, pollutants or hazardous chemicals), industrial and mechanical accidents, labour disruptions, fires, explosions, encountering unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, landslides, power outages and periodic interruptions due to inclement weather conditions, the occurrence of any of which could result in damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production or delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and potential legal liability. For example, on 15 March 2012, there was a fatal incident involving an employee of Talvivaara at the Talvivaara mine. Kainuu's police department is investigating the incident as a potential breach of occupational health and safety laws. Relating to the incident, Talvivaara announced on 2 April 2012 that the Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency TUKES has requested Talvivaara to provide a clarification on occupational safety procedures at the Talvivaara mine. At the time of the request by the Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency TUKES, Talvivaara was carrying out a normal maintenance stoppage with special focus on areas mentioned in the request. Talvivaara delivered the requested clarifications to the Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency TUKES between 3 April and 5 April 2012. On 5 April 2012, the Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency TUKES confirmed the provided clarifications to be satisfactory, and Talvivaara started preparations for re-starting the metals recovery plant subsequent to completion of the maintenance work. Although Talvivaara maintains insurance in an amount that it considers to be adequate, liabilities could exceed policy limits, or insurance may not be available for all potential risks, in which event Talvivaara could incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on Talvivaara's business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any accidents caused by Talvivaara or third parties could harm the reputation of Talvivaara and have an adverse impact on its relationship with its contract partners and other stakeholders.

Risks relating to the Notes and the Guarantee

The Notes may not be a suitable investmentfo r all investors

Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

(i)

have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and risks of

investing in the Notes and the information contained or referred to in this Prospectus;

(ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on its overall investment portfolio;

(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes; and

(iv) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.

Credit risk

The investors of the Notes are exposed to a credit risk in respect of the Issuer and the Guarantor. The investor's possibility to receive payment under the Notes is thus dependent on the Issuer's and the Guarantor's ability to fulfil their payment obligations, which in turn is to a large extent dependent on developments in Talvivaara's business and financial performance.

No security

No one other than the Issuer and the Guarantor will accept any liability whatsoever in respect of any failure by the Issuer to pay any amount due under the Notes. The Notes are unsecured debt instruments and the holders would be unsecured creditors in the event of the Issuer's and/or the Guarantor's bankruptcy or reorganization. Claims of secured creditors will have priority, with respect to their security, over the claims of unsecured creditors, such as holders of the Notes.

14

Accordingly, any adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of the Issuer and/or the Guarantor may negatively impact the liquidity and the market prices for the Notes, and endanger the probability that the holder will receive the prompt and full payment, when due, for principal, interest and/or any other amounts and items payable to the holders pursuant to the Notes from time to time.
Other guarantee obligations o f the Guarantor
The Guarantor has also other guarantee obligations than the Guarantee under the Notes. Fulfilment of such other guarantee obligations by the Guarantor may decrease the ability of the Guarantor to make a full payment under the Guarantee to the holders of the Notes. Other guarantee obligations of the Guarantor may also be secured obligations and accordingly, claims under such secured guarantees will have priority over unsecured guarantee claims, such as the claims under the Guarantee.
Absence o f rating
The Notes and the Issuer are not currently rated by any rating agency.
Early redemption
As specified in Condition 8.2 "Early Redemption" of the terms and conditions of the Notes, the Issuer is entitled, in its sole discretion, subject to having given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice to the holders of the Notes, redeem all (but not some only) of the outstanding Notes after 4 April 2015 but before the Redemption Date. There can be no assurance that the holders of the Notes will be able to reinvest the amounts received upon redemption at a rate that will provide the same rate of return as their investment in the Notes.
In addition, the holders of the Notes are entitled to demand premature repayment of the Notes in cases specified in Conditions 12 "Events of Default" and 13 "Change of Control" of the terms and conditions of the Notes. Such premature repayment may adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to repay the Notes of such holders of the Notes who elect not to exercise their right to get their Notes prematurely repaid. Investors are also exposed to the risk that several debt obligations of the Issuer may become due simultaneously, as a result of which the investor in the Notes may have to wait for payment until the Issuer has paid other debts which rank senior to the Notes.
Furthermore, as specified in Condition 13 "Change of Control" of the terms and conditions of the Notes, if more than 75 per cent of the aggregate volume of the Notes has been repaid pursuant to a demand by the holders of the Notes based on a change of control of the Issuer, the Issuer is entitled to also prepay the remaining outstanding Notes by notifying the holders of the Notes of such prepayment. The early redemption triggers a so-called re-investment risk as the investor cannot necessarily re-invest the prematurely returned principal with as high yield as the investor was originally supposed to be paid under the Notes.
No prior public marketfo r the Notes
The Notes constitute a new issue of securities. Prior to the listing of the Notes on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, there is no public market for the Notes. Although application will be made to list the Notes on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, there can be no assurance that such application will be approved. In addition, listing of the Notes will not guarantee that an active public market for the Notes will develop, and if such a market were to develop, neither the Issuer nor the Joint Bookrunners is/are under any obligation to maintain such a market. The liquidity and the market price for the Notes can be expected to vary with changes in market and economic conditions, the financial condition and prospects of the Issuer and other factors that generally influence the market prices of securities. Such fluctuations may significantly affect the liquidity and the market prices of the Notes, which may trade at a discount to the price at which the holders purchased the Notes.
Holders of the Notes should be aware of the prevailing and widely reported global credit market conditions (which continue at the date of this Prospectus), whereby there is a lack of liquidity in the secondary market for instruments similar to the Notes. Such lack of liquidity may result in investors suffering losses on the Notes in secondary resales even if there is no decline in the performance of the assets of the Issuer. The Issuer cannot predict which of these circumstances will change and whether, if and when they do change, there will be a more liquid market for the Notes and instruments similar to the Notes at that time.
Fixed interest rate
The Notes will bear interest on their outstanding principal at a fixed interest rate. A holder of a security with a fixed interest rate is exposed to the risk that the price of such security could fall as a result of changes in the market interest rate. While the nominal compensation rate of a security with a fixed interest rate is fixed during the life of such security
15

or during a certain period of time, the current interest rate on the capital market (market interest rate) typically changes on a daily basis.
If the market interest rate increases, the market price of such a security typically falls until the yield of such security is approximately equal to the market interest rate. If the market interest rate falls, the price of a security with a fixed interest rate typically increases until the yield of such a security is approximately equal to the market interest rate. Consequently, the holders of the Notes should be aware that movements of the market interest rate can adversely affect the price of the Notes and can lead to losses for the holders of the Notes if they sell the Notes during the period in which the interest rate of the Notes is fixed.
Restricted limitation on issuing additional debt or granting o f security
Except for the limitation set out in the negative pledge clause in Condition 3 of the terms and conditions of the Notes, there is no restriction on the amount of debt which the Issuer may raise or issue after the issuing of the Notes that ranks pari passu or senior to the Notes. In addition, there is no restriction on granting of security by the Issuer on any existing or future debts except for the negative pledge clause in Condition 3 of the terms and conditions of the Notes. Such further debt or granting of security may reduce the amount recoverable by the holders of the Notes upon winding-up or insolvency of the Issuer, or may adversely effect the position and priority of the holders of the Notes in such winding-up or insolvency procedure.
The Notes will mature after a substantial portion o f the Group's indebtedness
The Notes will mature in 2017. If the Issuer is not able to refinance its indebtedness, the Issuer will be required to repay a substantial portion of its other creditors, including senior unsecured convertible bonds, before the Issuer is required to repay principal of the Notes. As a result, the Issuer may not have sufficient cash to repay all amounts owing to the Notes at maturity. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will have the ability to borrow or otherwise raise the amounts necessary to repay such amounts.
No voting rights
The holders of the Notes have no voting rights at the General Meetings of shareholders of the Issuer. Consequently, at the Issuer's General Meetings of shareholders, the holders of the Notes cannot influence any decisions by the Issuer to redeem the Notes or any decisions by the Issuer's shareholders concerning, among others, the capital structure of the Issuer.
Legislative amendments
The Notes are issued under Finnish law in force on the issue date. Any new statutes, ordinances and regulations, amendments to the legislation or changes in application of the law after the issue date may affect the Notes and the Issuer makes no representations in this regard.
Prescription
If any payment under the Notes has not been claimed within three years from the original due date thereof, the right to such payment will become void. Such prescription may cause final losses to holders of the Notes who have not claimed payment under the Notes within the prescription time of three years.
Modification
The terms and conditions contain provisions for calling Noteholders' Meetings to consider matters affecting the interests of holders of the Notes generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all holders of the Notes, including holders of the Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and holders of the Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.
Clearing and settlement
The Notes issued are linked to the account-based book entry system of Euroclear Finland; consequently, no physical securities will be issued. Clearing and settlement in connection with trading in Notes takes place in the OM system of Euroclear Finland. Holders of the Notes are dependent on the book entry system of Euroclear Finland in order to obtain payments under the Notes.
16

Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent (i) Notes are legal investments for it, (ii) Notes can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing and (iii) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any Notes. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

Accordingly, in certain instances, the sum of the numbers in a column or row may not conform exactly to the total figure given for that column or row. In addition, certain percentages presented in the tables in this Prospectus reflect calculations based upon the underlying information prior to rounding and, accordingly, may not conform exactly to the percentages that would be derived if the relevant calculations were based upon the rounded numbers.

Mineral Resource Reporting
The Group's resources described in this Prospectus constitute Talvivaara's estimates that comply with standard evaluation methods generally used in the international mining industry and are stated in conformity with the JORC Code. The resource information included in this Prospectus has not been verified by an independent expert. All mineral resources included herein are quoted for the two Talvivaara deposits as a whole and are not attributable with respect to the 84 per cent ownership of Talvivaara Sotkamo.
Mineral resources as defined by the JORC Code are based on mineral occurrences quantified on the basis of geological data and an assumed cut-off grade, and are divided into measured, indicated and inferred categories reflecting decreasing confidence in geological and/or grade continuity. No allowances are included for dilution and losses during mining, but the reporting of resource estimates carries the implication that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic exploitation. Resources may therefore be viewed as the estimation stage prior to the application of more stringent economic criteria for reserve definition, such as a rigorously defined cut-off grade and mine design outlines, along with allowances for dilution and losses during mining. Mineral resource categories are defined as follows:

·

A "mineral resource" is a concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic economic interest in or on the

Earth's crust in such form and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The

location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known, estimated or

interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. Mineral resources are sub-divided, in order of

increasing geological confidence, into inferred, indicated and measured categories.

·

A "measured mineral resource" is that part of a mineral resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical

characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a high level of confidence. It is based on

detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques

from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. The locations are spaced closely

enough to confirm geological and/or grade continuity.

·

An "indicated mineral resource" is that part of a mineral resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical

characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence. It is based on

exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as

outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. The locations are too widely or inappropriately spaced to

confirm geological and/or grade continuity but are spaced closely enough for continuity to be assumed.

·

An "inferred mineral resource" is that part of a mineral resource for which tonnage, grade and mineral content

can be estimated with a low level of confidence. It is inferred from geological evidence and assumed but not

19

verified geological and/or grade continuity. It is based on information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes which may be limited or of uncertain quality and reliability.

Included in this Prospectus are various statements relating to the potential at Talvivaara's exploration targets. The disclosure of target potential follows specific guidance in section 18 of the JORC Code, specifically that the target potential should be expressed as a range of quantity and grade, with an explanation of the basis of the statement. The summary statement of potential for each target is expressed explicitly on the basis that (i) the potential range of quantity and grade is conceptual in nature, there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource on the target and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the discovery of a mineral resource on the target; and (ii) the mineralised potential constitutes a possible mineral deposit that is to be the target of further exploration.

In that event, the Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor will pay such additional amounts as are necessary in order that the net amounts received by the holders of the Notes after the withholding or deduction equals the respective amounts that would have been receivable in respect of the Notes in the absence of the withholding or deduction (such amounts being "Additional Amounts"), except that no Additional Amounts will be payable in relation to any payment in respect of any Note:

26

(a) to, or to a third party on behalf of, a holder of a Note who is liable to the Taxes in respect of the Note by reason of his having some connection with Finland other than the mere holding of the Note;
(b) to, or to a third party on behalf of, a holder of a Note who would not be liable or subject to the withholding or deduction by making a declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for exemption to the relevant tax authority; or
(c) where such withholding or deduction is imposed on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive.

The Issuer shall notify the holders of the Notes pursuant to Condition 15 of any Event of Default (and the steps, if any, taken to remedy it) promptly upon becoming aware of its occurrence.
Each of the following events will constitute an "Event of Default":
(a) Non-Payment: any amount of interest on or principal of the Notes has not been paid within five (5) Business Days from the relevant due date, unless the failure to pay is caused by a reason referred to in Condition 18;
(b) Cross Default: any indebtedness (including guarantees given by the Issuer) of the Issuer or the Guarantor of at least fifteen million euros (EUR 15,000,000) or its equivalent in any other currency is accelerated prematurely because of default, howsoever described, or if any such indebtedness is not repaid on the due date thereof or within any applicable grace period after the due date. A holder of the Notes will not be entitled to demand repayment under this sub-condition (b) if the Issuer has bona fide disputed the existence of the occurrence of an Event of Default under this sub-condition (b) as long as such dispute has not been finally and adversely adjudicated against the Issuer or the Guarantor;

13. Change of Control
If, after the Issue Date, a Change of Control (as defined below) occurs, the Issuer shall promptly notify the holders of Notes of such event in accordance with Condition 15.
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Issuer shall, on the Prepayment Date (as defined below), prepay 101 per cent of the principal amount of and accrued interest on the Notes held by holders of Notes who have required prepayment of Notes held by them by a written notice to be given to the Issuer by no later than fifteen (15) Business Days before the Prepayment Date. Interest on the Notes accrues until the Prepayment Date (excluding the Prepayment Date).
If Notes representing more than seventy-five (75) per cent of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes have been prepaid on the Prepayment Date pursuant to this Condition 13, the Issuer is entitled to prepay also the remaining outstanding Notes at their nominal principal amount with accrued interest but without any premium or penalty by notifying the holders of Notes in accordance with Condition 15 no later than 15 Business Days after the Prepayment

A Change of Control in respect of the Guarantor will only be deemed to have occurred if the Issuer ceases to directly or indirectly control more than 50 per cent of the total voting rights represented by the shares in the Guarantor as a result of changes in the ownership of the shares of the Guarantor. For the purposes of this provision, "acting in concert" means a group of persons who, pursuant to an agreement or understanding (whether formal or informal), actively co-operate, through the acquisition by any of them, either directly or indirectly, of shares in the Issuer, to obtain or consolidate control of the Issuer.

"Prepayment Date" means the date falling forty-five (45) Business Days after the publication of the notice referred to in the first paragraph of this Condition 13.

SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Selected Financial Information of the Issuer

The following selected consolidated financial information has been derived from the audited financial statements of Talvivaara for the year ended and as at 31 December 2011 and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Talvivaara for the year ended and as at 31 December 2010 prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU.

Adjustments to audited consolidatedfinancial statementsfo r the year ended 31 December 2010

In February 2010, Talvivaara concluded a long-term Zinc in Concentrate Streaming Agreement with Nyrstar. Under the terms of the agreement, Talvivaara shall deliver all of its zinc in concentrate production to Nyrstar until a total of 1,250,000 metric tonnes has been delivered. Talvivaara received an advance payment of USD 335 million from Nyrstar for the agreed deliveries. The advance payment was initially classified as a monetary liability and translated to euros on the basis of end-of-period exchange rates. Exchange rate gains and losses were recognised on the income statement as finance income or cost. Talvivaara has reclassified the advance payment as a non-monetary liability and restated the financial statements of prior periods according to IAS 8 in connection with its interim report for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2011. The reclassification better reflects the financial nature of the transaction, as the advance payment is repaid through physical deliveries and, therefore, there is no actual foreign exchange risk. The financial information presented below for the year ended 31 December 2010 is, therefore, unaudited.

Selected Financial Information of the Guarantor The following selected financial information has been derived from the audited financial statements of the Guarantor for the year ended and as at 31 December 2011 and 2010 prepared in accordance with FAS. The consolidated financial statements of the Issuer including the financial information of the Guarantor for the year ended and as at 31 December 2011 and 2010 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The accounting principles applied to the Guarantor's FAS financial statements differ from the accounting principles applied to the Issuer's consolidated IFRS financial statements. Main differences relate to the accounting treatment of the perpetual capital loan, finance lease arrangements, hedge reserve and accumulated depreciation difference. The perpetual capital loan is unsecured and subordinated to all senior debt and is treated as equity in the Issuer's consolidated IFRS financial statements. In the Guarantor's FAS financial statements, the perpetual capital loan is treated as a non-current borrowing. The Guarantor has concluded lease agreements for mobile equipment, equipment related to power supply and materials handling equipment. In the Guarantor's FAS financial statements these lease arrangements have been treated as operating leases and rental expenses have been expensed as incurred. In the Issuer's consolidated IFRS financial statements these lease arrangements have been treated as finance leases, and acquisitions of property and equipment are capitalised at the commencement of the lease and depreciated over the useful life of the asset. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability. In the Issuer's consolidated IFRS financial statements, the hedge reserve includes the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument, net of tax. The Issuer ceased to apply hedge accounting on forecast nickel sales on 31 December 2009. At that time, amounts taken to hedge reserve remain in hedge reserve and they are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale occurs. In the Guarantor's FAS financial statements, the Issuer has not applied hedge accounting and gains or losses on hedging instruments have been recognized in income statement as incurred. Accumulated difference between the Guarantor's depreciation expense in the financial statements and in taxation is treated as appropriations (depreciation difference) in the FAS financial statements separately from the shareholders equity. Under IFRS, accumulated depreciation difference is not recorded as a separate line item but it is considered as a timing difference between taxbase and book base. In the Issuer's consolidated IFRS financial statements, the accumulated depreciation difference, net of tax, is treated as equity and related deferred tax liability is recorded against deferred tax assets.

BUSINESS OF TALVIVAARA
A s the Guarantor is the sole operative subsidiary o f the Issuer and carries out the mining and mineral activities at the Talvivaara mine, the description o f Talvivaara's business under this Section "Business o f Talvivaara" is also the description o f the Guarantor's business, unless information on the Guarantor has been separately provided, or the context otherwise requires.
Overview
Talvivaara is an internationally significant base metals producer with its primary focus on nickel and zinc. Talvivaara's main asset is the Talvivaara mine in Sotkamo, Finland. The Talvivaara polymetallic deposits, Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi, comprise one of the largest known sulphide nickel resources in Europe. The classified mineral resources are currently estimated by Talvivaara at 1,550 million tonnes of ore, of which 1,121 million tonnes are in measured and indicated categories.
Talvivaara started its operations in the Talvivaara mine in 2008 and produced its first commercial quantities of nickel sulphide in February 2009. Following this, Talvivaara has focused on ramping up its production. As by-products of the mine, Talvivaara produces zinc and cobalt and also expects to produce copper starting in 2012. In addition, in February 2010, Talvivaara announced its plan to recover uranium in the form of uranium oxide as a by-product. The Finnish Government granted the requested license under the Nuclear Energy Act on 1 March 2012. However, the application for environmental permit is pending as at the date of this Prospectus.
Talvivaara supplies metal intermediates, such as mixed nickel cobalt sulphide, zinc sulphide and copper sulphide, to companies with metal refining operations. Talvivaara has entered into a 10-year off-take agreement with Norilsk Nickel for the entire output of the Talvivaara mine's nickel and cobalt production at market prices. In January 2010, Talvivaara Sotkamo entered into the Zinc in Concentrate Streaming Agreement with Nyrstar for the delivery of its entire zinc in concentrate production to Nyrstar until a total of 1.25 million tonnes of zinc in concentrate has been delivered. Further, Talvivaara Sotkamo entered into a uranium off-take agreement with Cameco in February 2011.
Talvivaara develops the Talvivaara deposits using technology known as bioheapleaching. This technology harnesses locally occurring, live bacteria for the extraction of metals from ore. During the last few years, Talvivaara has demonstrated the viability of using bioheapleaching technology for the extraction of nickel from the Talvivaara ore. The Talvivaara ore body is well suited to open-pit mining due to thin overburden, favourable resource geometry and a low waste to ore ratio. The ore is of a relatively low grade (0.22 per cent nickel), but is well suited to bioheapleaching due to its high sulphide content and low pH, which enables rapid leaching and reduces the need for chemical catalysis.
The Issuer was registered on 9 September 2003 and it is organised under the laws of the Republic of Finland. The registered business name of the Issuer is Talvivaara Mining Company Plc and it is domiciled in Sotkamo, Finland. The Issuer is registered in the Finnish Trade Register under business identity code 1847894-2, and its registered office is located at Ahventie 4 B 47, FI-02170 Espoo, Finland, and its telephone number is +358 20 712 9800.
According to Article 2 of its Articles of Association, the line of business of the Issuer is to engage in ore exploration, exploitation, excavation and other mining activities as well as in the sale and purchase of mining rights. Talvivaara may also attend to the organisation, financing and purchases of the group of companies and to other joint tasks of the same kind, and it may own real estate, shares and participations and carry on securities trading and other investment business. The Issuer operates either directly or through subsidiaries.
History
The Issuer and Talvivaara Sotkamo were incorporated in September 2003 for the purpose of acquiring and developing the two Talvivaara deposits, Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi. When Talvivaara Sotkamo acquired the exclusive rights to mine the Talvivaara deposits from Outokumpu Mining in February 2004, Talvivaara Sotkamo was also assigned the right to use all exploration data and research documentation relating to bioheapleaching without additional compensation. In return, Outokumpu Mining was granted an option to acquire a 20 per cent interest in Talvivaara Sotkamo. Outokumpu Mining exercised this option on 14 May 2007 and, as a result, Talvivaara Sotkamo has been an 80 per cent owned subsidiary of Talvivaara since that date. On 1 June 2011, Talvivaara entered into an agreement with Outokumpu Mining and its parent company, Outokumpu Oyj, to acquire an additional four per cent shareholding in Talvivaara Sotkamo. As a result of the acquisition, Talvivaara's ownership in Talvivaara Sotkamo increased from 80 per cent to 84 per cent and Outokumpu Mining's ownership decreased to 16 per cent. Simultaneously, Talvivaara entered into an exclusive option agreement with Outokumpu Mining Oy and Outokumpu Oyj whereby it had the right, at its sole discretion, in one or more instalments, to acquire Outokumpu Mining's remaining 16 per cent shareholding in Talvivaara Sotkamo for EUR 240 million at any time prior to 31 March 2012. Talvivaara did not exercise such option.
38

In June 2005, Talvivaara started the construction of an on-site pilot heap to test bioheapleaching and the initial bioheapleaching process commenced in August 2005. Pilot runs of metals recovery process were carried out from March to September 2006. In September 2005, Talvivaara submitted its EIA report as a precondition for applying for and obtaining an environmental permit. In March 2007, Talvivaara was issued an environmental permit and a starting order that allowed it to commence construction and other activities at the Talvivaara project area.
The construction of the Talvivaara mine commenced in April 2007 and continued throughout 2008, with focus in the first half of 2008 on preparations for mining, materials handling and bioheapleaching operations, and in the second half of 2008 on the completion of the metals recovery plant. In January 2008, the Talvivaara mine was connected to the Finnish national main grid by a 43 kilometre power line constructed from the Vuolijoki substation to the mine. In addition, construction of the 25 kilometre Talvivaara-Murtomäki railway, which began in February 2008, was completely commissioned and permitted in November 2009, before which limited production from the mine was transported by truck. The railway became part of the national railway network in September 2011. In 2009, Talvivaara focused on ramping up its production and generated its first sales revenues. Commercially significant production at the Talvivaara mine began in February 2009.
In 2010, Talvivaara continued to focus on ramping up production towards full-scale capacity, and produced 10,382 tonnes of nickel and 25,462 tonnes of zinc. Talvivaara also launched a project to study the possibility of expanding production beyond the current 50,000 tonnes of nickel per annum target, with scoping studies based on doubling production capacity to 100,000 tonnes of nickel and integrating further downstream to produce refined nickel metal. Talvivaara's production ramp-up continued in 2011, and Talvivaara produced 16,087 tonnes of nickel and 31,815 tonnes of zinc. During 2011, Talvivaara also commenced work to extract uranium in the form of uranium oxide as a by-product and continued to advance the project to expand production capacity beyond 50,000 tonnes of nickel per annum.
Talvivaara's shares were admitted to trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange in June 2007 (trading symbol "TALV"). Talvivaara is included in the FTSE 250 Index. In addition, Talvivaara's shares were admitted to trading on the Helsinki Stock Exchange in May 2009 (trading symbol "TLV1V").
Recent Trends
Following general sentiment driven weakness during the latter half of 2011, nickel and base metals prices more broadly have shown signs of recovery in early 2012. Volatility is however expected to remain at an elevated level, as investors and other market participants assess the likely outcome of the European sovereign debt crisis as well as the global growth outlook.
Barring a severe global recession, significant downside to nickel prices beyond levels already seen in late 2011 would appear to be capped by marginal costs of production. Talvivaara continues to believe the longer term support level to be around U.S.$ 20,000 per tonne.
Talvivaara expects the global nickel market to remain broadly balanced from a supply-demand perspective. Several new laterite nickel projects have continued to face commissioning issues, and it appears increasingly likely that their contribution to supply in the near term will be limited. Chinese nickel pig iron (NPI) production is expected to also balance the market as the utilisation rate of this capacity tends to quickly react to variations in nickel price.
Key Strengths
Extensive sulphide nickel resource with a long mine life. The Talvivaara polymetallic deposits, Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi, comprise one of the largest known sulphide nickel resources in Europe. The Talvivaara deposits have an estimated 1,121 million tonnes of ore in measured and indicated categories, which is estimated to support projected production for several decades.
Favourable characteristics o f the Talvivaara deposits. The Talvivaara deposits have a thin overburden and a low average waste to ore ratio of 1/1, making the deposits easy to mine. The ore is relatively low grade (0.22 per cent nickel), but is well suited to open-pit mining and also bioheapleaching due to its high sulphide content and low pH, which enables rapid leaching and reduces the need for chemical catalysis.
Cost-effective and scalable bioheapleaching technology. The bioheapleaching technology used by Talvivaara has proven to enable cost-effective development and exploitation of the sulphide nickel resource. The technology provides Talvivaara with significant cost advantages, both in terms of capital and operational costs.
Demonstrated successful ramp-up o f production. Talvivaara has already demonstrated that all of its production processes can perform at the planned design capacity levels, and that the bioheapleaching technology is a suitable and effective method for extracting metals from Talvivaara's ore deposits. Talvivaara produced 16,087 tonnes of nickel in 2011, and increasingly evolved from a project towards a stable process plant.
39

Secured long-term agreements fo r nickel, cobalt and zinc and uranium. Talvivaara supplies metal intermediaries, such as mixed nickel cobalt sulphide, zinc sulphide, copper sulphide and uranium oxide, to companies with metal refining operations. Talvivaara has entered into a 10-year off-take agreement for nickel and cobalt with Norilsk Nickel and it has entered into a Zinc in Concentrate Streaming Agreement with Nyrstar for sale of its zinc concentrate production to Nyrstar until a total of 1.25 million tonnes of zinc in concentrate have been delivered. Talvivaara also has a long-term off-take agreement with Cameco for sale of Talvivaara's entire uranium production until 2027.
Favourable operational environment in Finland. With good infrastructure, subsidy policies and an economically and politically stable operating environment together with readily available mining expertise, Finland provides a favourable environment for operating a mine.
Financial flexibility and strengthened capital base. Talvivaara has proven, diversified access to financing across the capital structure to secure sufficient liquidity and to manage volatility inherent to the commodity markets. Talvivaara also strengthened its capital base through a directed share issue in February 2012, demonstrating the support and commitment of Talvivaara's major shareholders.
M anagement team with extensive industry experience. The Group has a dedicated team of leading geology and mining experts, including G. Edward Haslam, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, who has significant experience in the mining industry having served as the Chief Executive Officer of Lonmin Plc from 2000 to 2004 as well as serving on boards of several other mining companies. Mr. Pekka Perä, Talvivaara's founder and Chief Executive Officer, has approximately 16 years of experience in successfully managing a number of large mining projects both in Finland and internationally. Mr. Harri Natunen, who joined Talvivaara on 19 March 2012 and will succeed Mr. Pekka Perä as the Chief Executive Officer on 26 April 2012, has over 30 years of operational and managerial experience in the international mining industry, including a long term successful track record in the Finnish mining sector. Subject to their reappointment at Talvivaara's Annual General Meeting of shareholders on 26 April 2012, Mr. Pekka Perä will become Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and G. Edward Haslam will retire from the position of the chairman of the Board of Directors, but he will continue to serve Talvivaara as non-executive director. The core team is supported by industry experts, some of whom have worked with the Talvivaara ore body for nearly 20 years.
Corporate Strategy
Talvivaara is an internationally significant base metals producer with its primary focus on nickel and zinc, aiming to achieve profit margins equal to or better than those achieved by comparable base metal mining companies. The key components of Talvivaara's strategy are:
Ensure the position o f the Talvivaara mine as a world-leading low-cost nickel producer. For the last four years, the primary focus of Talvivaara's operations has been on the effective development of the Talvivaara deposits into a well managed, profitable mining operation. Upon reaching its currently planned full production capacity of approximately 50,000 tonnes of nickel annually, the Talvivaara mine will be one of the 10 largest nickel mines globally. Talvivaara also anticipates its cost-efficient bioheapleaching technology and large scale of operations will contribute to a low cash cost of production and competitive profit margins.
Maintain a strong financial profile. Talvivaara's aim is to maintain a strong financial profile through cash flow generated from operations and sustained operating and capital cost discipline.
Growth through sustainable bioheapleaching technology. In line with its strategy to exploit its mineral resources as efficiently as possible, Talvivaara actively studies opportunities to recover additional metals, such as manganese, from the Talvivaara ore. In the longer term, Talvivaara is also considering processing the leached metals further downstream into refined metals to add further value through its operations.
Growth through expansion o f the Talvivaara mine. Based on available exploration data and geological characteristics of the region, Talvivaara estimates that the resource base in the Talvivaara area is sufficient for production expansion beyond the currently planned capacity of approximately 50,000 tonnes of nickel annually, and that production expansion at Talvivaara would be cost efficient in international comparison. Conceptual studies for further production expansion started in 2010 and continue with the tentative target of executing the new investment programme in 2014-2018 and commencing a gradual ramp-up of the expanded production from 2016 onwards.
Focus on personnel development, performance and motivation. The number of employees at Talvivaara has increased from approximately 50 at the time of Talvivaara's listing in 2007 to 461 as at 31 December 2011. The rapid increase in personnel poses a considerable challenge as skilled employees are critical to the successful ramp-up and profitable operations of the Group. In order to secure the availability of competent personnel, Talvivaara has trained most of its workforce in tailored training programmes and continues to recruit employees through apprenticeship arrangements. The competence of Talvivaara's personnel is also developed and maintained through further training, which also promotes job rotation and aims at ensuring that professional skills supporting Talvivaara's strategy can be met from internal resources.
40

During the fourth quarter of 2011, Talvivaara launched the "Talvivaara Way of Working" programme which is targeted at improving all operational procedures and creating a shared and consistent working environment. Furthermore, Talvivaara aims to maintain and improve personnel performance and retention through bonuses and long term incentive plans that reward safe and productive operational performance as well as improvement in the Talvivaara share price.

History o f Geological Work and Exploration

Geological work in the Talvivaara area commenced in the early 1900's when geological mapping of bedrock was conducted by the Geological Survey of Finland ("GSF") and continued through 1951. Between 1951 and 1962, various Finnish companies carried out exploration activities in the area. The result of this phase led GSF to commence detailed exploration in the area in 1977. As a result of the work done by GSF, two polymetallic deposits, Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi, were established. Outokumpu Mining acquired these deposits from the Finnish State in 1985 and the mining license covering the deposits was granted to Outokumpu Mining in 1986. Between 1989 and 1992, Outokumpu Mining focused on further geological work on the Talvivaara deposits.

Despite extensive exploration in the Talvivaara area that established the presence of large deposits, it was concluded at the time that exploitation of the relatively low-grade deposits would not be economically viable using conventional techniques. Therefore, the Talvivaara deposits remained unexploited until Talvivaara Sotkamo acquired the rights to the deposits and continued the geological work by focusing on sampling for metallurgical purposes and investigating sample areas for the pilot trial conducted in 2005 and 2006.

Geology

The two Talvivaara deposits are located in the southern part of the Kainuu belt, also known as the Kainuu schist zone. The belt is approximately 200 kilometres long with a maximum width of approximately 40 kilometres. The Talvivaara deposits comprise two different polymetallic ore bodies, Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi. The mineral resources in these ore bodies have been classified according to the JORC Code. The Competent Person as defined by the JORC Code was the former Chief Geologist of Talvivaara, Mr. Jukka Pitkäjärvi. The new Competent Person will be Mr. Hannu Lahtinen as of the spring of 2012. Talvivaara's total mineral resources, as defined by the JORC code, stand at 1,550 million tonnes, which contain 3.4 million tonnes of nickel and 7.6 million tonnes of zinc, corresponding to average metal grades of 0.22 per cent nickel and 0.49 per cent zinc. Both of the Talvivaara deposits are outcropping and relatively easy to mine.

41

Significant exploration potential remains between the Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi deposits and to the north of the Kolmisoppi deposit. Talvivaara expects to update its mineral resources statement in late 2012.

The dimensions of the ore bodies are as follows:

Length
2,800 5,500

Orebody

(metres) 40-600 30-350

Depth

Three mineralogical ore types can be distinguished in the Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi ore bodies: fine-grained dissemination, sulphide breccia and skarn ore. The average sulphide mineral content of the ore bodies is approximately 15 to 25 per cent. The main sulphides are pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and pentlandite. Pentlandite contains between 75 to 88 per cent of the nickel and pyrrhotite is the second most important mineral in terms of nickel content. Pyrite contains the majority (between 67 and 90 per cent) of the contained cobalt while chalcopyrite carries copper and sphalerite carries zinc.

The paleoproterozoic black schists in Finland typically also contain low concentrations of uranium. The black schist hosted ore at Talvivaara contains uranium in concentrations ranging from 0.0001 per cent to 0.04 per cent. Uranium occurs as thucholite, which is a mixture of hydrocarbons, uraninite and sulphides. In September 2009, GSF carried out gamma radiation measurements with a portable gamma spectrometer. Measured dose rates were between 0.04 and 0.21 pSv/h and the measurements did not show any abnormal gamma radiation values within the Talvivaara mine area. The Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety classifies dose rates between 0.05 and 0.30 pSv/h as typical background gamma radiation in Finland. The dose rates measured from the Talvivaara ore correspond to uranium concentrations of between 12.2 and 22.0 parts per million. Thorium equivalent grades were between 3.0 and 7.0 parts per million.

During 2011, Talvivaara's geological activities focused primarily on resource infill drilling to improve geological mapping of already known ore profiles. Apart from a brief campaign at the Kuusilampi deposit in early 2011, drilling was carried out at the Kolmisoppi deposit where mining operations have not yet commenced. In total, approximately 11,000 metres were drilled during 2011.

In drillings performed in 2011, Talvivaara investigated the Kolmisoppi mineral deposit to determine how far north it extends. Drilling operations proceeded as planned and showed that the area offers excellent ore exploration potential, providing Talvivaara with an excellent opportunity to further grow its mineral resources.

The investigative drillings confirmed that, in its currently known form, the Kolmisoppi deposit extends at least 2.5 kilometres north. Preliminary drillings in the northern extension were completed at the end of the year. These were followed by further drillings to obtain more detailed information on the quantity and quality of the ore. By the time Talvivaara's mineral resource estimate will be updated, which is expected to take place in late 2012, the supplementary drillings at Kolmisoppi will have been completed.

Currently, Talvivaara's annual production target for nickel is 50,000 tonnes at full capacity. As by-products of the mine, it also expects to produce approximately 90,000 tonnes of zinc, 15,000 tonnes of copper and 1,800 tonnes of cobalt
42

annually. Talvivaara revised its nickel production target for 2011 to between 22,000 and 28,000 tonnes due to unplanned downtime of the metals recovery plant in the first quarter of 2011 and certain capacity-limiting bottlenecks identified at the plant. The nickel production target for 2011 was further lowered in the third quarter to a minimum of 16,000 tonnes due to problems with the hydrogen sulphide generators. Talvivaara's production target for 2012 is between 25,000 and 30,000 tonnes of nickel and between 50,000 and 60,000 tonnes of zinc. See "Risk Factors--Operational Ramp-up".
Talvivaara started conceptual studies relating to potential production expansion beyond the current annual target in late 2010 and such conceptual studies were carried out throughout 2011. By 31 December 2011, the preparations for the EIA were at an advanced stage and the actual EIA work started in early 2012. The EIA covers certain parallel process options, as the final production processes and end products have not yet been chosen. Following the EIA, Talvivaara expects to submit the environmental permit application for the expansion in 2012. Provided that a decision is made to proceed with the expansion, investments are expected to commence following the receipt of an environmental permit, currently anticipated to take place in 2014.
In February 2010, Talvivaara announced its plan to recover uranium in the form of uranium oxide from the solution obtained from the bioheapleaching process. The solution does not contain much uranium, but a recently developed technology makes it commercially viable to extract even low levels of uranium as long as there is sufficient leach solution. Talvivaara's application to the Ministry of Employment and the Economy for a permit in accordance with the Nuclear Energy Act was filed in April 2010, and Talvivaara obtained the permit on 1 March 2012. However, an appeal against the decision of the Finnish Government has been filed with the Supreme Administrative Court by an organization for environmental protection. The EIA, which was in progress for most of the year 2010, was completed during the first quarter of 2011. The environmental permit application for uranium extraction was submitted to the regional environmental permitting agency in March 2011, and the permit process is ongoing. Talvivaara has on 3 April 2012 been verbally informed by the regional environmental permitting agency that Talvivaara's environmental permit application for uranium extraction and the review of Talvivaara's environmental permit are to be processed together. The permitting authorities have informed Talvivaara that a decision on the uranium permit will be made during 2012. In addition, Talvivaara received European Commission approval for the agreements between Talvivaara and Cameco discussed in "-- Material Agreements" below in November 2011. A further ratification by the European Commission pursuant to the Euratom Treaty was obtained in January 2012. Subject to receiving all the necessary permits, uranium production is expected to commence in late 2012 and Talvivaara targets annual uranium production of 350 tonnes at full capacity.
See "--Regulatory Framework and Rights to the Talvivaara Deposits" below.
Production Process
General
Talvivaara's production process begins with large-scale open-pit mining, followed by materials handling, which covers all the physical ore processing steps from primary crushing to stacking and leaching of the ore in heaps. The ore is first leached for 13 to 14 months on the primary leach pad at full production, after which the leached ore is reclaimed, conveyed and re-stacked on the secondary heap pad. After secondary leaching, the leached ore remains on the secondary heaps permanently.
For metals recovery, a side stream of pregnant leach solution ("PLS") is continuously led from leaching circulation to the metals processing plant, where metals are precipitated from the PLS by chemical reactions. The resulting products are metal intermediates - copper sulphide, zinc sulphide and a mixed nickel cobalt sulphide - which are then transported for further processing in refineries operated by Talvivaara's customers. Talvivaara is also constructing a circuit to recover uranium from PLS in the form of uranium oxide (UO4), with production expected to commence in late 2012, subject to receiving all the necessary permits.
Process waste, primarily gypsum, is taken to designated waste ponds. Water, from which the saleable metals and other elements such as iron have been removed, is returned to circulation to irrigate the ore heaps. All structures in contact with ore or leach solutions are insulated from the surrounding environment by permanent physical barrier layers.
43

The following diagram sets out the production process at the Talvivaara mine:
Open-pit Mining The mining method used at Talvivaara is large-scale open-pit mining. The planned annual ore production is approximately 24 million tonnes. The total tonnage mined (ore and waste) will vary from 35 to 60 million tonnes annually. The average waste to ore ratio over the life of mine is estimated to be close to one. Talvivaara extracts ore and waste rock using conventional drill and blast methods with a fleet of self-propelled diesel hydraulic track drill rigs. The blasted ore or waste rock is loaded by large mining excavators onto heavy duty trucks. The trucks then haul the ore to the primary crusher located outside the pit perimeter and take the waste to secondary heaps or designated waste dumps. Crushing - Conveying - Stacking After primary crushing close to the open pit, the ore is conveyed to a crushing station in the vicinity of the metals recovery plant where it is crushed in three further stages so that 80 per cent of the resulting particles are approximately eight millimetres or less in size. The particle size of the ore plays an important role in the process, with smaller particle sizes correlating to faster leaching. In industrial heap leaching operations, however, very small particle sizes are often not desirable, largely due to high crushing costs and problems in heap stability and permeability with finely crushed ore. At Talvivaara, the key process parameters have been chosen largely in line with industry practice in commercial copper leaching operations. These include a particle size of approximately eight millimetres.
44

The crushed ore is then agglomerated in a slowly rotating drum, where the leach solution, which contains acid and bacteria, is added to the ore in order to consolidate fine ore particles with coarser ones. This preconditioning phase makes the ore permeable to air and water, both of which are necessary for the bioheapleaching process. After the agglomeration process, the ore is conveyed and stacked in eight metre high piles on the primary heap pad for 13 to 14 months at full production stage.
Bioheapleaching
Bioheapleaching is a process whereby metals are leached from the ore as a result of bacterial catalysis. In nature, bioheapleaching is triggered spontaneously by naturally occurring micro-organisms in the presence of air and water. The reaction is usually seen as the slow weathering of sulphide-containing ore bodies. Commercially applied bioheapleaching technologies accelerate this natural process and typically use the same bacteria. This is also the case at Talvivaara, where locally sourced bacteria are used. Talvivaara does not have any registered intellectual property rights related to the bioheapleaching technology. See "--Intellectual Property Rights" below.
Crushed ore is used as the starting material and leaching is activated by the irrigation and aeration of ore heaps. The heap is equipped with piping, laid in two layers in the heap, through which low-pressure fans supply air to the stacked ore. From the top, the heap is irrigated with leach solution, which is recycled through the heap until its metal content is sufficient for metals recovery. Several physico-chemical and microbiological process parameters, such as the acidity of the irrigation solution, the rate of irrigation, the rate of removal of the PLS and the rate of aeration, are continuously monitored and modified in order to enhance and speed up the leaching process.
Once a sufficient metal concentration is reached, a continuous side stream of PLS is led to the metals recovery plant, and either fresh or purified process water is added to the circulation to maintain the process water balance and appropriate leaching conditions.
After leaching on the primary pad, the leached ore is reclaimed, conveyed and restacked onto the secondary heap pad, where it is leached further in order to recover metals from parts of the primary heaps where the leach solution had poor contact. Such areas include the slopes and surface of the heaps and areas between channels formed by the circulating leach solution.
The primary heap pad at Talvivaara is constructed as a dynamic, or on-off, pad. After the primary leaching, the ore is reclaimed using excavators and conveyed to the secondary leach pad for further leaching. While the excavators move ahead reclaiming the ore, the stacker follows behind it continuously stacking new ore.
After secondary leaching, the barren ore will remain permanently on the secondary heaps. A series of waste dumps have been constructed for the storage of the overburden and waste rock that is excavated during the mining process. Both the heap foundations and the waste dumps are lined with permanent bentonite and plastic layers to prevent leaks.
Bioheapleaching offers advantages over conventional physico-chemical extraction methods both economically and environmentally. In contrast to roasting and smelting, a large energy input is not required and no sulphur dioxide or other noxious gases are produced. In addition, bioleaching residues are chemically less active.
In 2010, the efficiency of bioheapleaching was improved by upgrading the heap's aeration system of the heap and by testing various heap shapes and heights. The heaps are monitored intensively, which has provided a better understanding of the behaviour of the heaps under various conditions.
Metals Recovery
In the metals recovery process, Talvivaara's saleable metals are precipitated from the PLS using chemicals. The resulting products are intermediates - copper and zinc sulphides and a mixed nickel cobalt sulphide - which are sold and transported for further processing in refineries operated by Talvivaara's customers.
The main chemicals required in the process include hydrogen sulphide, which is produced on site from elemental sulphur and hydrogen, along with limestone, burnt lime and sodium hydroxide. The metals recovery process produces neutralisation precipitates as mixtures of metal precipitates (iron, aluminium, magnesium and manganese) and gypsum. The pre-neutralisation gypsum precipitate is deposited in waste rock dumps as filter dry material. Other precipitates are deposited in an engineered tailings pond.
Talvivaara has developed its metals recovery processes in collaboration with OMG Kokkola Chemicals Oy. The methodology is based on a process which is currently used commercially by OMG Kokkola Chemicals Oy in Kokkola, Finland.
45

Property, Plant and Equipment
Talvivaara owns approximately 5,400 hectares of land, some of which is outside of the current mining concession area. The Talvivaara mining concession covers approximately 6,000 hectares, of which approximately 1,000 hectares have been designated for mining operations. Approximately 88 per cent of the total land in the current mining concession area is owned by Talvivaara. Under Finnish law, Talvivaara has the right to mine the area covered by the mining concession even if the area is owned by third parties.
Prior to construction of the pilot operation in 2005, the Talvivaara mine area had no existing mining facilities. Although all infrastructure and services had to be built before the commencement of commercial production, the mine benefits from a favourable location as there is easy access to road, railway and power line connections. By the end of 2009, practically all major infrastructure projects had been completed. The main achievement was the completion of a 25 kilometre railway between Murtomäki and Talvivaara. Regular transport on the railway started in September 2009 after the necessary permits had been obtained. Final approvals for the electrified operation of the railway were received in November 2009. In accordance with the Finnish Parliamentary budget decision of June 2007, the Finnish State reimbursed EUR 40 million of the cost of the railway to Talvivaara over a two-year period between 2010 and 2011 provided that the railway was used as the primary transportation route of the mine. The first reimbursement of EUR 20 million was paid in June 2010 and the second reimbursement of EUR 20 million in September 2011. Upon full payment by the Finnish State, the title to the railway transferred to the Finnish Rail Administration and the railway became part of the national railway network.
Transportation infrastructure was also developed through improvement and partial re-routing of the regional road bypassing the mine area on its eastern side and the local road crossing the mine area in the east-to-west direction. In addition, a 43 kilometre power line from the Vuolijoki substation, located west of Talvivaara, to the mine area was commissioned in January 2008, connecting the mine directly to the national grid. The pipeline for the intake of process water from Lake Kolmisoppi in the northern part of the mine concession area has been operational since July 2008.
As at 31 December 2011, the carrying amount of Talvivaara's property, plant and equipment was EUR 762.0 million, of which EUR 294.5 million was attributable to machinery and equipment, EUR 41.3 million to construction in process, EUR 241.3 million to land and buildings and EUR 184.9 million to other tangible assets.
Regulatory Framework and Rights to the Talvivaara Deposits
Overview o f Finnish M ining Legislation
General
The principal mining legislation in Finland consists of the Mining Act (621/2011, annulling the former Mining Act 503/1965) and the Mining Decree (663/1965, as amended). The competent authority with regard to the mining issues is the Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency (Tukes) and the Finnish Ministry of Employment and Economy guides, supervises and develops activities under the new Mining Act. In Finland, the right to seek, claim and exploit a deposit that contains extractable minerals belongs to any person domiciled within the EEA. Other persons may only conduct mining operations under a separate license granted by the Ministry of Employment and Economy.
The new Mining Act became effective on 1 July 2011. A number of material changes were made to practically all stages of a mining project, from prospecting and permitting to operations and closure of the mine. Although the new mining act will mostly have an impact on new mining projects in Finland, the existing mines, such as the Talvivaara operations, are also affected to a limited extent. However, Talvivaara estimates that the new mining act has not had and will not have a significant impact on its current operations.
The Mining Concession System
This description of the Finnish mining concession system is based on provisions of the former Finnish Mining Act because such provisions are applied to Talvivaara's existing operations.
A person may apply for a mining concession if he can prove the viability of exploiting the claimed area. A mining concession may include areas that are necessary to exploit the deposit, such as land required for infrastructure.
If a mining concession application fulfils the criteria set forth in the Mining Act, the Ministry of Employment and Economy will grant the concession and send the decision to the respective local surveying office for execution. A mining concession decision of the Ministry of Employment and Economy can be appealed to the Finnish Supreme Administrative Court within 45 days of the grant date. If a mining concession holder has not commenced mining within a period of five to ten years, the Ministry of Employment and Economy will hear the concession holder and may instruct
46

the concession holder to commence mining within two years at the risk of losing the concession. This period may be extended by the Ministry of Employment and Economy.
A person who has been granted a concession must pay an annual concession fee to the Ministry of Employment and Economy and annual compensation to the owners of any land covered by the claim. In addition, as compensation for the extracted minerals, the concession holder must pay an annual excavation fee. The amount of the annual excavation fee is determined by the Ministry of Employment and Economy after consulting with its mining board.
Rights to the Talvivaara Deposits
The mining license covering the Kolmisoppi and Kuusilampi deposits was originally granted to Outokumpu Mining in 1986 and was subsequently assigned to Talvivaara Sotkamo on 31 March 2004. Title to the mining concession was transferred to Talvivaara Sotkamo on 14 May 2007.
On 24 March 2005, Talvivaara Sotkamo submitted an application to the Ministry of Employment and Economy to extend the concession area covered by the original mining license. On 3 October 2006, the Ministry of Employment and Economy issued a land surveying order to a local surveying office regarding the extension of the concession area in accordance with the application. Two appeals were filed with the Finnish Supreme Administrative Court in an attempt to have this land surveying order revoked. The order was subsequently upheld by the Finnish Supreme Administrative Court in October 2007. The land surveying and redemption proceedings regarding the extension were, however, appealed both on the basis of the compensation awarded to land owners and the proceedings themselves. The appeal on the compensation was later cancelled and the decision by the Kainuu-Koillismaa District Survey Office concerning compensation to land owners, as paid by Talvivaara in 2008, became final and binding on 16 April 2009. Accordingly, there are no appeals pending against the extension of the concession area.
Talvivaara is in a process for preparing an application for further extension of the concession area. This extended area would be used to support the expanded operations of the mine area. See "Risk Factors--Governmental Approvals and Permits'' and "Risk Factors--Mining Concessions" .
Other Mining Claims
Talvivaara has a claim to an area called Botesbotten, which is located in Oravainen, Finland. Pursuant to the claim, Talvivaara may carry out research activities relating to nickel and copper mining. On 27 March 2009, Talvivaara applied for an extension of the mining claim, which the Ministry of Employment and Economy granted until 31 March 2012.
Environmental Matters
General
The environmental aspects of mining activities, among other aspects, are governed by the Finnish Environmental Protection Act (86/2000, as amended). According to the act, an environmental permit is required for activities posing a threat of environmental pollution. The Finnish Environmental Impact Assessment Act (468/1994, as amended) and Decree (713/2006, as amended) are the two principal environmental laws or regulations that must be satisfied in order to complete an EIA necessary for the mining operations. In addition the Water Act, the Waste Act (1072/1993, as amended), the Act on Transport of Dangerous Goods (719/1994, as amended) and the Decree on the Industrial Handling and Storage of Hazardous Chemicals (59/1999, as amended) include environmental regulations relevant to mining operations.
Talvivaara's compliance with its obligations under applicable environmental laws and regulations is monitored regularly by environmental authorities. Talvivaara has to comply with environmental laws and regulations governing various aspects of its operations, including noise and dust emission levels, waste processing, use of chemicals and other materials, use of energy, discharges into water and vibration. In accordance with the environmental permit, the impact of Talvivaara's mining operations on the area and its wildlife is included in the scope of regular monitoring. In addition, effects on the natural environment are followed via monitoring of metal concentrations in ants and mushrooms.
Talvivaara is responsible for the restoration of the mine area after the closure of mining operations. Talvivaara has prepared a rehabilitation plan for the mine, and restoration measures are continuously implemented as the ramp-up progresses. After the closure of operations, the Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi open pits will be allowed to fill up with water and the areas will be landscaped by planting vegetation. The gypsum ponds will be equipped with subsoil drainage, covered and landscaped. In each section of the ore deposit, Talvivaara collects and stores soil removed from the top layer before mining operations commence, which will be used for bottom structures during landscaping after the closure of mining operations. Talvivaara has placed a guarantee of EUR 32.8 million to the Kainuu Regional Environmental Centre to ensure remediation of the dumping areas. As at 31 December 2011, Talvivaara had recorded a provision of EUR 5.9 million for environmental restoration.
47

To date, Talvivaara has not been fined or penalized for environmental issues. However, there have been some incidents that have required action by Talvivaara. In the first half of 2010, there were three incidents of discharge into surface water bodies, all of which were classified as exceptional. These incidents were reported to the supervising authority, which conducted an inspection after each incident. In addition, Talvivaara extended its monitoring activities by taking extra samples from the affected water bodies until the concentrations of introduced materials were below the limit of determination. In late 2010 and early 2011, higher than anticipated concentrations of sodium, sulphate and manganese were detected in Talvivaara's discharge waters. With Talvivaara's immediate reaction to the elevated concentrations and cooperation with local authorities to remedy the situation, by December 31, 2011 manganese levels were reduced by 80 per cent and sulphate levels by 50 per cent since early 2011 and permanent damage to the nearby lakes was avoided. Talvivaara continues to focus on further recycling of process waters, optimised consumption of chemicals and research into other technologies and equipment to reduce the discharge levels even further. In autumn 2011, a notice was filed with the police relating to Talvivaara's sulphate and manganese emissions under the Environmental Protection Act. The police investigation is ongoing, but Talvivaara firmly believes that no crime has been committed.
Talvivaara has an extensive environmental monitoring program, from which Talvivaara incurs some EUR 300,000 in annual expenses. The monitoring programme is carried out by an external and independent consultant organisation and the monitoring results are simultaneously provided to the supervising authorities and Talvivaara. In addition to the official sanctioned monitoring programme, Talvivaara carries out its own supplementary monitoring program and pursues continuous development work aimed at reducing emissions.
At the end of 2010, Talvivaara was awarded ISO 14001 certification for its environmental management system. The system is used for guiding environmental management and setting targets for its continuous improvement. The certified environmental management system covers all operations of Talvivaara. Talvivaara's ISO 14001 environmental certification was renewed in late 2011. Talvivaara commenced development work on its ISO 9001 standard compliant quality management system and OHSAS 18001 standard compliant occupational health and safety management system. Certification for both management systems will be sought in 2012. The objective of the OHSAS 18001 standard, which is based on comprehensive risk analysis, is to prevent accidents and illness, and to ensure personnel well-being by integrating health and safety issues with company management. Talvivaara also commenced development of a risk management system in accordance with the ISO 31000 standard. Risk assessment for disasters under the Seveso II directive was updated.
In 2011, Talvivaara's environmental investments amounted to approximately EUR 30.3 million, compared to EUR 28.5 million in 2010. Talvivaara's environmental investments have related primarily to reduction of emissions, building base structures and damming. Environmental operating costs were EUR 37.4 million in 2011, compared to EUR 25.9 million in 2010. Talvivaara's environmental costs have related primarily to various environmental monitoring activities and actions taken at the mine. In 2011, EUR 14.9 million of the total environmental costs were attributable to the control of hydrogen sulphide odours. As at 31 December 2011, provisions related to environmental management amounted to EUR 5.9 million and collateral to EUR 32.8 million.
Environmental Impact Assessment
Projects subject to the EIA procedure typically have significant impacts on the environment. The completion of an EIA is a precondition for applying for an environmental permit. The EIA regarding the Talvivaara project was completed on 30 December 2005.
Talvivaara is considering further expansion of its production, which requires preparation of an EIA and submission of an environmental permit application. Talvivaara currently expects to submit the environmental permit application for the expansion in 2012. The EIA reviews increasing production to the current target capacity level of 50,000 tonnes of nickel per annum, as well as covers options to expand capacity to 65,000 tonnes or 100,000 tonnes of nickel per annum. See "-- Talvivaara Mine--Production" above for further information.
In February 2010, Talvivaara announced its plan to recover uranium in the form of uranium oxide from the solution obtained from the bioheapleaching process. Talvivaara's application to the Ministry of Employment and the Economy for a permit in accordance with the Nuclear Energy Act was filed in April 2010, and Talvivaara received the permit on 1 March 2012. However, an appeal against the decision of the Finnish Government has been filed with the Supreme Administrative Court by an organization for environmental protection. The EIA, which was in progress for most of the year, was completed during the first quarter of 2011. A statement to this effect was obtained from the local environmental authority, which declared the EIA sufficient. The environmental permit application for uranium extraction was submitted to the regional environmental permitting agency in March 2011, and the permit process is ongoing. Talvivaara has on 3 April 2012 been verbally informed by the regional environmental permitting agency that Talvivaara's environmental permit application for uranium extraction and the review of Talvivaara's environmental permit are to be processed together. The permitting authorities have informed Talvivaara that a decision on the uranium permit will be made during 2012.

Environmental Permits
Talvivaara's environmental permit, issued in March 2007, became final and binding through a ruling by the Finnish Supreme Administrative Court in November 2008. The environmental permit for water intake and leading from the Northern Finland Environmental Permit Authority in accordance with the Finnish Water Act (264/1961, as amended) was granted together with the environmental permit.
The environmental permit is valid until further notice; however, the terms and conditions of the environmental permit are reviewed by the environmental authorities three years after the commencement of mining activities. Talvivaara filed an application for review of the existing environmental permit in March 2011 and it expects to obtain the updated permit during 2012. Talvivaara may continue to operate under its permit as before and any changes to its permit become effective only after the review has been finalised and the decision becomes effective. The application for review is subject to appeal. For matters under the Environmental Protection Act, the Northern Finland Environmental Permit Authority may amend the environmental permit or cancel it in certain limited circumstances.
Pursuant to the terms of the environmental permit, Talvivaara Sotkamo must compensate land and water area owners affected by the Talvivaara project and has certain obligations with regard to the fishing industry. As at the date of this Prospectus, the total compensation paid to landowners was EUR 214,010, all of which was paid in 2009. For the fishing industry, Talvivaara Sotkamo must make an annual payment of EUR 5,000.
Other Environmental Matters
In addition to the main permits described above, Talvivaara has filed a number of applications to amend the terms of the original environmental permit and to cover certain specific areas of operations as production has ramped up. Talvivaara has all permits necessary for its current operations.
Chemicals Regulations
Talvivaara's operations involve the handling and storage of dangerous substances covered by the Seveso II directive. Talvivaara's safety management is guided by Finnish legislation, international regulations and the Group's own safety processes. With respect to chemical safety, Talvivaara's operations are regulated by the Seveso II directive, the REACH regulation and the product information requirements set forth in the CLP regulation. Talvivaara complies with the REACH and CLP regulations regarding product information. The REACH regulation requires that manufacturers and importers of chemicals assess any risks caused by the use of such chemicals and provide instructions for their safe use. The CLP regulation includes guidelines on how chemicals classified as dangerous are to be labelled and packed so as to ensure their safe use. In 2010, Talvivaara's key products were registered in accordance with the REACH regulation. Nickel and zinc sulphide dossiers were submitted to the authorities for registration, and the CLP regulation data for all of Talvivaara's substances were compiled.
Government Policies Affecting Talvivaara
Talvivaara operates in Finland, which offers the mining industry a favourable and politically stable operating environment. Finland has a good and well-functioning infrastructure that contributes to successful mining. The road and railway network is comprehensive and the availability of energy and raw materials is good. The Finnish State has supported the Talvivaara project directly and indirectly. For example, Talvivaara has received development financing from Tekes, a development and research funding agency financed by the Government of Finland, and participates in several research projects supported by Tekes. The Finnish State has also participated in the financing of the 25 kilometre railway connecting the Talvivaara mine to the national railway network. Subject to agreed minimum transportation volumes on the railway being achieved, the Finnish State agreed to reimburse the construction expenses of Talvivaara Infrastructure Oy ("Talvivaara Infrastructure") up to EUR 40 million in two instalments and to redeem the railway to be part of the national railway network. The first reimbursement of EUR 20 million was paid in June 2010 and the second reimbursement of EUR 20 million in September 2011. Upon full payment by the Finnish State, the title to the railway transferred to the Finnish Rail Administration and the railway became part of the national railway network. The Finnish State has also participated in power line and road improvement investments, and in total has supported mine infrastructure by approximately EUR 48 million.
Research and Development
Talvivaara pursues an active research and development strategy, the primary objective of which is to develop the production process and minimise its environmental impact. Talvivaara's research and development strategy is closely linked with its operations. At present, Talvivaara's research and development activities mainly serve the ongoing production ramp-up and improvement of bioheapleaching. During the ramp-up phase, the primary objective of the development work is to increase production capacity, upgrade metals recovery and reduce environmental impact. Talvivaara has a small research and development department and a research laboratory. The production departments also
49

participate in development work, playing a key role in the enhancement of the production process in particular. Talvivaara's research and development expenditure for the years ended 31 December 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to EUR 739,000, EUR 468,000 and EUR 731,000, respectively.
In addition to independent research work, Talvivaara cooperates with external partners, such as customers, technology and equipment suppliers, research institutes and several Finnish universities. In its research and development work, Talvivaara also takes advantage of its extensive international network of technology companies and other mining companies. Talvivaara also participates in several research projects supported by Tekes. Further, Talvivaara takes part in an innovation environment project of the mining and mineral industry coordinated by the University of Oulu. The objective of this project is to train experts in the mining and mineral industry and develop research in the field by creating a leading national network for the industry. The project also includes construction of a test enrichment plant on the premises of the University of Oulu to be used by companies and research institutes in the industry.
Investments
Talvivaara's capital expenditures amounted to EUR 79.1 million in 2011 and EUR 115.7 million in 2010.
In 2011, the capital expenditures related primarily to secondary heap foundations, secondary leaching equipment, and construction of a gypsum pond and the uranium extraction facility.
In 2010, the capital expenditures related primarily to the construction of heap foundations, installation of the second production line of the metals recovery plant and purchase of the secondary heap stacker and conveyors.
Talvivaara's principal investments that are in progress include construction of the secondary heap, gypsum pond and uranium recovery circuit. As at 30 December 2011, the Group had contractual commitments of EUR 14.5 million. These commitments relate to acquisition of new property, plant and mining equipment. For the year 2012, Talvivaara expects capital expenditure to be EUR 45-50 million, excluding the construction cost of the uranium extraction circuit, which will be covered by Cameco up to an amount of U.S.$ 60 million. A significant portion of the expected capital expenditure in 2012 relates to earthworks, specifically the construction of secondary heap foundations, the cost of which is difficult to estimate accurately in advance. Talvivaara will finance these investments from cash flow from operating activities and, if necessary, external debt.
The capital expenditures above were primarily incurred by the Guarantor.
Intellectual Property Rights
The Group does not currently have any registered intellectual property rights related to the bioheapleaching technology, and Talvivaara does not consider it likely that this process, which occurs naturally, could be patented. Should any rights that may be registered arise as a result of Talvivaara's operations, Talvivaara will take all reasonable actions that are necessary to protect such rights. See "Risk Factors-- Technology and Intellectual Property Rights".
Talvivaara has filed one patent application relating to biological iron removal. Biological iron removal reduces the consumption of limestone used in solution purification. The application is pending.
Competition
Competition in the base metals mining industry is driven by supply-demand balances and metal prices, which in turn are affected by general economic cycles and shorter term market factors. At times when excess supply, lack of demand or various economic factors result in low metal prices, the mines with the highest production costs are at risk of losing profitability and may have to discontinue production. Due to its cost efficient production technology and favourable resource geometry, Talvivaara anticipates, once in full scale operation, being able to operate the Talvivaara mine profitably even during the lows of commodity price cycles. Impact of competition on Talvivaara is further mitigated by the fact that the Group has entered into long-term agreements whereby it has committed to sell and customers have committed to purchase the entire nickel, cobalt and zinc as well as the potential uranium production obtained from the Talvivaara mine.
Legal Proceedings
The Group has no pending governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any proceedings which are pending or threatened of which the Issuer or the Guarantor is aware) that may have, or may have had in the past 12 months, a significant effect on the financial position or profitability of the Issuer, the Guarantor and/or the Group, nor is the Issuer or the Guarantor aware of any such proceedings being threatened.

Talvivaara Sotkamo Ltd
Talvivaara Sotkamo is the sole operative subsidiary of Talvivaara and carries out the mining and mineral activities at the Talvivaara mine. When Talvivaara Sotkamo acquired the exclusive rights to mine the Talvivaara deposits from Outokumpu Mining in February 2004, Talvivaara Sotkamo was also assigned the right to use all exploration data and research documentation relating to bioheapleaching without additional compensation. In return, Outokumpu Mining was granted an option to acquire a 20 per cent interest in Talvivaara Sotkamo, which option it exercised on 14 May 2007. On 1 June 2011, Talvivaara acquired an additional four per cent shareholding in Talvivaara Sotkamo. As a result of the acquisition, Talvivaara's ownership in Talvivaara Sotkamo increased from 80 per cent to 84 per cent and Outokumpu Mining's ownership decreased to 16 per cent. Simultaneously, Talvivaara entered into an exclusive option agreement with Outokumpu Mining Oy and Outokumpu Oyj whereby it will have the right, at its sole discretion, in one or more instalments, to acquire Outokumpu Mining's remaining 16 per cent shareholding in Talvivaara Sotkamo for EUR 240 million at any time prior to 31 March 2012 (see "Business o f Talvivaara--Material Agreements--Share Purchase and Option Agreement").
HSH Nordic Finance Talvivaara Ab
In August 2008, Talvivaara Sotkamo (Talvivaara Project Ltd at the time of signing the agreement) and HSH Nordic Finance Talvivaara Ab ("HSH Nordic Finance") entered into an arrangement for the transfer of full and valid title to and ownership of certain equipment ordered by Talvivaara Sotkamo to HSH Nordic Finance and the subsequent leasing of said equipment by HSH Nordic Finance to Talvivaara Sotkamo upon complete delivery and acceptance of the equipment. HSH Nordic Finance is a wholly owned subsidiary of DAL Nordic Finance AB (formerly HSH Nordic Finance AB). Although the Group has no shareholding in HSH Nordic Finance, it is consolidated as it is considered that the Group has the power to control the day-to-day usage of the equipment and to obtain all the benefits from its operation. HSH Nordic Finance does not make any significant economic decisions as its primary function is to receive and forward lease payments from Talvivaara Sotkamo to DAL Nordic Finance AB.
Talvivaara Management Oy
In December 2010, the Board of Directors of Talvivaara decided on a new shareholding plan directed to members of the executive management of Talvivaara. For the purpose of the share ownership, the participants acquired a limited liability company named Talvivaara Management Oy ("Talvivaara Management"), whose entire share capital they own. Although the Group has no shareholding in Talvivaara Management, the company is consolidated because the participants have agreed to vote in favour of the proposals made by the Board of Directors of Talvivaara in General Meetings and, therefore, Talvivaara has the power over the voting rights of shares owned by Talvivaara Management. Furthermore, Talvivaara Management does not make any significant economic decisions, as its primary function is to manage the investments made by the participants.
Employees
As at 31 December 2011, Talvivaara had 461 employees, of which 378 were employed by the Guarantor. As at 31 December 2010, Talvivaara had 389 employees, of which 310 were employed by the Guarantor. Talvivaara believes that Talvivaara's labour relations with personnel are good. Talvivaara is a member of the Federation of Finnish Technology Industries and participates in its activities both locally and nationally.
Most of Talvivaara's employees are members of trade unions. Production employees usually belong to the Finnish Metalworkers' Union, salaried employees to the Union of Salaried Employees (`Pro' as of 1 January 2011) and upper salaried employees to the Federation of Professional and Managerial Staff.

Material Agreements
Sale and Option Agreement and Agreement Amending the Original Sale and Option Agreement
On 27 February 2004, Talvivaara, Talvivaara Sotkamo and Outokumpu Mining entered into a sale and option agreement (as amended, the "Sale and Option Agreement") pursuant to which Outokumpu Mining sold the exclusive rights to mine the Talvivaara deposits to Talvivaara Sotkamo. Talvivaara Sotkamo was also assigned the rights to use all exploration data and research documentation relating to bioheapleaching without additional compensation. The amendment agreement dated 15 September 2006 partly amended the Sale and Option Agreement, which is detailed below.
The purchase price was EUR 1. In addition, Outokumpu Mining was granted an option to acquire shares in Talvivaara Sotkamo representing 20 per cent of the entire issued share capital in Talvivaara Sotkamo. This option was exercised by Outokumpu Mining on 14 May 2007. The mining license covering the Talvivaara deposits was assigned to Talvivaara Sotkamo in March 2004 and title to the mining concession was transferred to Talvivaara Sotkamo when Outokumpu Mining exercised its option to subscribe for the 20 per cent interest in Talvivaara Sotkamo.
Pursuant to the Sale and Option Agreement, Outokumpu Mining's 20 per cent shareholding in Talvivaara Sotkamo is protected against dilution until Talvivaara Sotkamo has produced and sold at least 30,000 tons of nickel from the Talvivaara mine and the mine has been in operation for at least three months without interruption (excluding normal maintenance stoppages) at production levels corresponding to an annual nickel production of at least 30,000 tonnes. As a result of such anti-dilution measures, Outokumpu Mining has no obligation to participate in any equity financing of Talvivaara Sotkamo and Outokumpu Mining has a right to the 20 per cent shareholding in Talvivaara Sotkamo irrespective of any equity financing undertaken by Talvivaara Sotkamo.
Pursuant to the Sale and Option Agreement, Talvivaara Sotkamo is responsible for all environmental and other liabilities that relate to the mining rights.
Share Purchase and Option Agreement
On 1 June 2011, Talvivaara entered into an agreement with Outokumpu Mining and its parent company Outokumpu Oyj to acquire an additional four per cent shareholding in Talvivaara Sotkamo. As a result of the acquisition, Talvivaara's ownership in Talvivaara Sotkamo increased from 80 per cent to 84 per cent and Outokumpu Mining's ownership decreased to 16 per cent. The acquisition price for the four per cent stake was EUR 60 million.
Simultaneously, Talvivaara entered into an exclusive option agreement with Outokumpu Mining Oy and Outokumpu Oyj (the "Option") whereby it had the right, at its sole discretion, in one or more instalments, to acquire Outokumpu Mining's remaining 16 per cent shareholding in Talvivaara Sotkamo for EUR 240 million at any time prior to 31 March 2012. Talvivaara did not exercise the Option.
As long as Outokumpu Mining holds any shares in Talvivaara Sotkamo, Outokumpu Mining has the right to appoint one member to the Board of Directors of Talvivaara Sotkamo.
Nickel-Cobalt Sale and Purchase Agreement
Talvivaara's nickel and cobalt production is delivered and sold to Norilsk Nickel under a long-term sale and purchase agreement. The agreement will remain in force for ten years from the start of full production, but at least 300,000 tonnes of nickel must be delivered and Norilsk Nickel has the right to buy an additional 150,000 tonnes at the prevailing world market price. The mixed nickel-cobalt sulphide is delivered by train to Norilsk Nickel's production facility in Harjavalta, Finland.
The nickel-cobalt products are "provisionally priced", which means that the quoted sale price is subject to final adjustment at the end of a quotational period, which is approximately three months. The price for nickel sulphide is the lower of the London Metal Exchange ("LME") settlement quotation and the LME 3 month price quotation as published in the Metal Bulletin and averaged over the quotation period. The price for cobalt is the Metal Bulletin free market low quotation as published in the Metal Bulletin and averaged over the quotation period. The provisional invoice accounts for 90 per cent of the delivered volume, while the final invoice accounts for the remaining ten per cent of the relevant delivery and the final sales price adjustment. The price includes treatment charges for nickel and cobalt as defined in the agreement and will be increased based on the defined increases in the U.S. consumer price index and the euro-index.
Nickel-cobalt products sales are initially recorded based on 100 per cent of the provisional sales prices. Until final settlement occurs, adjustments to the provisional sales prices are made to account for mark-to-market changes based on the forward prices for the estimated month of settlement. These adjustments are made at the end of a reporting period. For this purpose, the selling price can be reliably measured using forward prices from an active and freely traded commodity market such as the London Stock Exchange. The marking to market of provisionally priced sales agreements
52

is recorded as an adjustment to sales revenue. For changes in metal quantities upon receipt of new information and assay, provisional sales quantities are also adjusted.
Zinc in Concentrate Streaming Agreement
Talvivaara Sotkamo entered into the long-term Zinc in Concentrate Streaming Agreement with Nyrstar in 2010 and received an advance payment of U.S.$ 335 million for the zinc stream. The advance payment has been recognised in liabilities and is gradually unwound to revenues during the term of the agreement. Talvivaara Sotkamo will deliver its entire zinc production exclusively to Nyrstar until the agreed total volume of 1.25 million tonnes of zinc in concentrate has been reached. Based on Talvivaara's current production plans, deliveries are expected to occur over a period of 10 to 15 years.
Revenues from zinc consist of two components. Talvivaara Sotkamo recognises a fixed price per tonne of zinc in concentrate delivered, which results from the unwinding of the advance payment. In addition, Talvivaara Sotkamo receives an extraction and processing fee of EUR 350 per tonne of zinc in concentrate delivered, with escalators in relation to prices of elemental sulphur and propane, less applicable product specification penalties, if any. Talvivaara Sotkamo also receives additional price fees if the average LME zinc price during the 30-day period prior to delivery exceeds certain levels as set out in the agreement. Until the later of the seventh anniversary of the agreement and delivery of 600,000 tonnes of zinc in concentrate, Nyrstar will pay to Talvivaara 10 per cent of the LME zinc price exceeding U.S.$ 2,500 per tonne and 30 per cent of the LME zinc price exceeding U.S.$ 3,000 per tonne. Thereafter, Nyrstar will pay Talvivaara 30 per cent of the excess of the LME zinc price above the processing fee of EUR 350 per tonne of zinc in concentrate.
Zinc products sales are initially recorded based on 100 per cent of the provisional sales prices. At final settlement, adjustments to the provisional sales prices are made if the final assays demonstrate different quantities of zinc or certain impurities than those that had been accounted for in the provisional invoice.
Talvivaara has provided the following security to Nyrstar in respect of the Zinc in Concentrate Streaming Agreement with Nyrstar: a secondary right of pledge to the floating charges in respect of Talvivaara Sotkamo in the aggregate amount of EUR 425 million, a secondary right of pledge to the mortgage deeds of the mortgage on Talvivaara Sotkamo's property in the aggregate amount of EUR 425 million and a secondary pledge over the mining rights for Talvivaara Sotkamo's mining concession (mining register number 2819).
Uranium Off-take Agreement
In February 2011, Talvivaara Sotkamo entered into a uranium take-in-kind agreement and a long-term uranium off-take agreement with Cameco. Under the terms of the uranium take-in-kind agreement, Cameco will provide an up-front investment up to a maximum of U.S.$ 60 million to cover the construction cost of a uranium extraction circuit. Cameco's capital contribution will be repaid through deliveries of uranium concentrate in the initial years of the agreement.
Once the capital is repaid, Talvivaara Sotkamo will exclusively sell and Cameco will purchase the uranium concentrate produced at the Talvivaara mine through the long-term uranium off-take agreement, which will be in effect until 31 December 2027. Cameco will pay for the uranium based on a formula that references market prices at the time of delivery. Annual uranium production is estimated at 350 tonnes, corresponding to approximately 410 tonnes of yellow cake.
Cameco provides technical assistance to Talvivaara Sotkamo in the design, construction, commissioning and operation of the uranium extraction circuit to be constructed at the Talvivaara mine. Subject to receiving the necessary permits and authorisations, Talvivaara Sotkamo plans to start construction in the coming months and complete it in 2012.
Talvivaara received European Commission approval for the agreements between Talvivaara and Cameco on 30 November 2011. A further ratification by the European Commission pursuant to the Euratom Treaty was obtained on 18 January 2012. In April 2010, Talvivaara Sotkamo applied to the Ministry of Employment and Economy for a permit to extract uranium as a by-product, in accordance with the Nuclear Energy Act and received the permit on 1 March 2012.
Financing Agreements
Senior Unsecured Convertible Bonds due 2013
On 14 May 2008, Talvivaara issued senior unsecured convertible bonds with a nominal value of EUR 84.9 million due 20 May 2013. The current conversion price (the share subscription price) is GBP 5.7931 (EUR 7.2703). At the current conversion price, the 2013 Bonds are convertible into 11,677,591 fully paid shares in Talvivaara. The conversion period of the 2013 Bonds commenced on 30 June 2008 and ends on 14 May 2013. The interest rate applied to the 2013 Bonds is
53

5.25 per cent per annum, payable semi-annually in arrear. Talvivaara must repay the 2013 Bonds in one instalment on the maturity date, 20 May 2013, to the extent the 2013 Bonds have not been converted into shares in Talvivaara.
The values of the liability component and the equity conversion component of the 2013 Bonds were determined at the issuance. The fair value of the liability component, included in the current borrowings, was calculated using a market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible loan. The residual amount, representing the value of the equity conversion option, is included in shareholders' equity in other reserves net of income taxes. As at 31 December 2011, an equity component of EUR 10.9 million for the 2013 Bonds was recognised in equity.
Senior Unsecured Convertible Bonds due 2015
On 16 December 2010, Talvivaara issued senior unsecured convertible bonds with a nominal value of EUR 225.0 million due 16 December 2015, of which EUR 1.8 million had been converted into shares in Talvivaara as at 31 December 2011. The current conversion price (the share subscription price) is GBP 6.8937 (EUR 8.2117). At the current conversion price, the 2015 Bonds are convertible into 27,180,636 fully paid shares in Talvivaara following the resolution by the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of Talvivaara on 27 January 2011 to issue special rights in relation to the 2015 Bonds. The conversion period of the 2015 Bonds commenced on 17 February 2011 and ends on 10 December 2015. The interest rate applied to the 2015 Bonds is 4.00 per cent per annum payable semi-annually in arrear, and the yield to maturity is 6.50 per cent, reflecting a redemption price of 114.5% at maturity. Talvivaara must repay the 2015 Bonds in one instalment on the maturity date, 16 December 2015, to the extent the 2015 Bonds have not been converted into shares in Talvivaara.
In January 2011, an Extraordinary General Meeting of Talvivaara resolved to approve the proposal of the Board of Directors for the issue of special rights in relation to 2015 Bonds. The value of the equity component for the 2015 Bonds was determined after resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting and it is recognised in equity. As at 31 December 2011, an equity component of EUR 9.0 million for the 2015 Bonds was recognised in equity.
Revolving Credit Facility
In June 2010, Talvivaara signed a EUR 100 million three-year revolving multicurrency credit facility with Nordea, Svenska Handelsbanken AB (publ), Branch Operation in Finland ("Handelsbanken") and Sampo. The facility had a margin of 3.0 per cent until 31 December 2010 and thereafter a varying margin of 1.75 to 3.0 per cent depending on Talvivaara's leverage ratio. The facility is intended for general corporate purposes.
In October 2011, Talvivaara signed an amendment agreement to the EUR 100 million revolving credit facility agreement with Nordea, Sampo, Handelsbanken and Pohjola Bank plc ("Pohjola"). The facility was expanded to EUR 130 million upon the addition of Pohjola to the lender group. The maturity of the facility was also extended by a year to 30 June 2014. As at 31 December 2011, the outstanding loan amount was EUR 50 million, as compared to EUR 0 as at 31 December 2010.
Talvivaara has provided the following security in respect of the revolving credit facility and also to the investment and working capital loans from Finnvera plc ("Finnvera") (see "--Investment and Working Capital Loans from Finnvera" below): the floating charges in respect of Talvivaara Sotkamo in the aggregate amount of EUR 425 million, the mortgage deeds of the mortgage on Talvivaara Sotkamo's property in the aggregate amount of EUR 425 million and a pledge over the mining rights for Talvivaara Sotkamo's mining concession (mining register number 2819).
Investment and Working Capital Loans from Finnvera
In April 2009, Talvivaara Sotkamo entered into a EUR 50 million loan agreement with Finnvera to finance capital expenditure and working capital relating to the construction and operation of the Talvivaara mine. The loan has a margin of 3.0 per cent. Of the total loan amount, EUR 45 million was drawn during the first half of 2009 and EUR 5 million was reserved for capitalisation of accrued interest. As at 31 December 2011, capitalisation of accrued interest amounted to EUR 5.0 million. No capitalisation of interest can be made after 31 December 2011. The loan agreement remains in force until all liabilities of Talvivaara Sotkamo towards Finnvera under the loan agreement and any intercreditor agreement are satisfied. The loan will be repaid in ten instalments starting in December 2013. In June 2010, the loan agreement was amended by an amendment agreement.
In June 2010, Talvivaara Sotkamo also signed an additional EUR 10 million investment and working capital facility with Finnvera with an eight-year maturity and a margin of 4.1 per cent. As at 31 December 2010, Talvivaara had fully drawn down the facility. The loan will be repaid in fourteen instalments starting in June 2012.
For information on security relating to the investment and working capital loans from Finnvera, see "--Revolving Credit Facility' above.

Corporate Governance

General

As a limited liability company incorporated in Finland, Talvivaara's decision making and administration is governed by the Finnish Companies Act and its Articles of Association. Talvivaara complies with the Finnish Securities Market Association' Finnish Corporate Governance Code 2010 for listed companies (the "Finnish Code") and the Insider Guidelines issued by the Helsinki Stock Exchange. In addition, Talvivaara follows the UK Corporate Governance Code dated June 2010 (the "UK Code").

Talvivaara's corporate governance and control system deviates from the following recommendations under the Finnish Code and the UK Code:

·

Finnish Code Recommendation 43 and UK Code provision B.1.1: Participation o f the members o f the Board o f

Directors in a share-related remuneration scheme. Talvivaara granted 2007 A options to the Non-Executive

members of the Board of Directors as a part of the 2007 Option Scheme. The options were granted in 2007 prior

to the listing of Talvivaara's shares on the London Stock Exchange. The options granted were disclosed in the

prospectus published in connection with the listing of Talvivaara's shares on the London Stock Exchange.

Thereafter, no options have been granted to Non-Executive Directors, nor has Talvivaara any intention to grant

such options to Non-Executive Directors in the foreseeable future. Consequently, Talvivaara also determines

Mr. Haslam, Ms. Carr, Mr. Niiva and Mr. Titcombe as independent of Talvivaara notwithstanding the options

granted.

·

UK Code provision B.3.2: The terms and conditions o f appointment o f non-executive directors. All the members

of the Board of Directors are appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders of Talvivaara. The term of the

directors ends with the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Talvivaara following the

appointment of the director. The annual remuneration payable for board and committee work and the basis for

its determination are solely decided by the General Meeting of Shareholders of Talvivaara. There are no

contracts on notice periods, remuneration or any other terms of appointment relating to a person's status as a

member of the Board of Directors.

·

UK Code provisions B.2.1, C.3.3 and D.2.1: The terms o f reference o f the Board Committee. The Nomination

Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee each have a written charter. Instead of the

full texts, the essential contents of the charters have been disclosed according to the Finnish Code

Recommendation 20 on Talvivaara's website. This way of presenting has been considered a clear and effective

way to make the essential information available to the shareholders of Talvivaara.

·

UK Code provision E.1.1: The Senior Independent Director should attend sufficient meetings with a range of

major shareholders to listen to their views in order to help develop a balanced understanding of the issues and

concerns of major shareholders. In 2011, the Board of Directors considered that it would not be either practical

or efficient for the Senior Independent Director to attend meetings with major shareholders unless requested by

shareholders or considered necessary by Talvivaara.

·

UK Code provision B.6.2: Evaluation o f the board o f FTSE 350 companies should be externally facilitated at

least every three years. The Board of Directors has carried out a self-assessment of its performance. The results

of the assessment are discussed by the Board members and used in developing the Board work. Talvivaara has

gone through the construction phase to ramp-up phase and continues its work towards the full steady-state

production. Thus, due to the current stage of development of Talvivaara, the evaluation of an external facilitator

has so far been seen neither necessary nor reasonable.

As a Finnish company listed on the London Stock Exchange, Talvivaara is subject to both the Finnish Securities Markets Act's regulations on regular and ongoing disclosure obligations and the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and

59

Transparency Rules of the UK FSA. As a result of the listing of Talvivaara's shares on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, Talvivaara is also subject to the rules of the Helsinki Stock Exchange.
Board structure
The UK Code recommends that the board of directors of a UK-listed company should include a balance of executive and non-executive directors to ensure that that no individual or small group of individuals can dominate the board's decision making. According to the UK Code, at least half of the board, excluding the chairman, should comprise non-executive directors determined by the board to be independent. The UK Code further recommends that one independent non executive director should be nominated as a senior independent director.
The Board of Directors consists of the Non-Executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and four Non-Executive Directors. One of the Non-Executive Directors will serve as the senior independent Non-Executive Director (Deputy Chairman). Talvivaara regards four of its Non-Executive Directors as independent, as defined in the UK Code, and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with their exercise of independent judgment.
Mr. Niiva, Ms. Carr, Mr. Titcombe and Mr. Järvinen are deemed to be independent of Talvivaara and significant shareholders. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. Haslam, meets the independence criteria both in relation to Talvivaara and to significant shareholders under the Finnish Code.
Board Committees
The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee, a Nomination Committee and Sustainability Committee. The composition and chairing of Talvivaara's committees is reviewed and decided annually by the Board of Directors. While the Committees have been assigned several significant tasks relating to Talvivaara's governance, it should be noted that under the Finnish Companies Act, the Committees have no independent decision making power, but rather concentrate on matters delegated to them more extensively for the purpose of issuing recommendations to the Board of Directors. The Committees report regularly on their work to the Board of Directors.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee monitors Talvivaara's financial reporting and financial forecasts. The Audit Committee focuses primarily on Talvivaara's compliance with legal requirements, accounting standards and, to the extent applicable, the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules, ensuring that an effective system of internal and financial controls is maintained. The Audit Committee also oversees the statutory audit and considers the independence, effectiveness and objectivity of the external auditors, including the nature and extent of non-audit services provided. Based on its consideration of the audit services, the Audit Committee prepares proposals pertaining to the election of the external auditors.
The Audit Committee considers and keeps under review the need for and effectiveness of Talvivaara's internal reporting and internal control policies and procedures for the identification, assessment and reporting of risks. The Committee focuses particularly on Talvivaara's compliance with legal requirements, accounting standards and, to the extent applicable, the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules, ensuring that an effective system of internal and financial controls is maintained
The Audit Committee consists of Ms. Carr (chairman), Mr. Titcombe and Mr. Niiva. The Chief Financial Officer attends the meetings of the Audit Committee by invitation. The Audit Committee convenes at least four times each year. The members of the Audit Committee must have the qualifications necessary to perform the responsibilities of the Audit Committee, and at least one its member must have expertise in accounting, bookkeeping or auditing. During 2011, the Audit Committee met four times.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee supervises, reviews and develops the remuneration and reward schemes of Talvivaara and the remuneration paid to the members of the Board of Directors. The Remuneration Committee makes the necessary proposals to the General Meetings of Shareholders of Talvivaara regarding the remuneration of the Board of Directors. The Remuneration Committee also makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding Talvivaara's remuneration policies, the implementation of incentive schemes for senior management, and performance reviews of Executive Directors and senior management of Talvivaara and its subsidiaries.
The Remuneration Committee consists of Mr. Niiva (chairman), Mr. Titcombe, Mr. Haslam and Mr. Järvinen. The Chief Executive Officer attends meetings of the Remuneration Committee by invitation. During 2011, the Remuneration Committee met twice.
60

Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee considers the composition of the Board of Directors and appointment of Directors. It also advises and makes proposals and recommendations to the General Meetings of Shareholders on issues relating to the composition and nomination of the Board of Directors. The Nomination Committee reviews regularly the size, composition and effectiveness of the Board of Directors. Only members of the Nomination Committee have the right to attend the Nomination Committee meetings. However, the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and external advisors may be invited to attend all or part of any meeting as and when appropriate. In connection with its duties, the Nomination Committee is authorized by the Board to take such independent advice (including legal or other professional advice, at Talvivaara's expense) as it considers necessary.
The Nomination Committee comprises three independent Non-Executive Directors. The quorum necessary for the transaction of business is two. The Nomination Committee has been chaired by the Deputy Chairman of the Board (Senior Independent Director), Mr. Titcombe. Its other members have been Mr. Niiva and Mr. Järvinen. During 2011, the Nomination Committee met twice.
Sustainability Committee
The Sustainability Committee focuses on overseeing that financial success of Company's operations goes hand in hand with Talvivaara's operations' efficiency, environmental performance and social responsibility. The Committee also ensures that the Group's sustainability policy is implemented in order Talvivaara to achieve its sustainability goals. Mr. Tapani Järvinen was elected as chairman of the Committee and its other members are Mr. Pekka Perä and Mr. Edward Haslam. The Chief Sustainability Officer attends the Committee meetings by invitation. During 2011, the Nomination Committee met once.
Conflicts of Interest
Save for their legal and/or beneficial interest in the shares in Talvivaara, there are (i) no potential conflicts of interest between any duties to Talvivaara of the directors and members of Executive Committee and their private interests and/or other duties; (ii) no arrangements or understandings with major shareholders, members, suppliers or others pursuant to which any director or member of the Executive Committee was selected; and (iii) no restrictions agreed by any director or member of the Executive Committee on the disposal within a certain time of their holdings in Talvivaara's securities.
Provisions regarding the conflicts of interest of the management of a Finnish company are set forth in the Finnish Companies Act. Pursuant to Chapter 6, Section 4 of the Finnish Companies Act, a member of the Board of Directors may not participate in the handling of a contract between himself and the company, nor may he participate in the handling of a contract between the company and a third party if he may thereby receive a material benefit which may be in contradiction with the interests of the company. This provision applies to any other legal act, legal proceeding or other similar matter. These provisions also apply to the Chief Executive Officer.

On 28 April 2011, the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Talvivaara elected PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy, Authorised Public Accountants, as its auditor, with Authorised Public Accountant Ylva Eriksson as the responsible auditor.
