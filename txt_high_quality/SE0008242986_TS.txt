Central Bank (Riksbanken) on its website (www.riksbank.se). If no such rate is available, the most recently published rate shall be used instead.

No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Noteholder to exercise any right or remedy under the Finance Documents shall impair or operate as a waiver of any such right or remedy.
STATUS OF THE NOTES
The Notes are denominated in SEK and each Note is constituted by the Trust Deed and these Terms and Conditions. The Issuer undertakes to make payments in relation to the Notes and to comply with these Terms and Conditions.
By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder agrees that the Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Notes, each subsequent Noteholder confirms such agreement.
The nominal amount of each Initial Note is SEK 1,000,000 (the "Nominal Amount"). All Initial Notes are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 100 per cent. of the Nominal Amount.
Provided that no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue and subject to the terms of the Trust Deed and the satisfaction of the conditions set out in Condition 4.1, the Issuer may, from time to time, without the consent of the Noteholders, issue Additional Notes having the same interest rate and ranking pari passu in all respects and so that the same shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Initial Notes and any other Additional Notes. The issue price of the Additional Notes may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Initial Notes. The aggregate nominal amount of Notes is not limited. Each Additional Note shall entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with Condition 8.1, and otherwise have the same rights as the Initial Notes.
The Notes constitute direct, general, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu and without any preference among them and at least pari passu with all other direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer, except obligations which are mandatorily preferred by law.
The Notes are freely transferable but the Noteholders may be subject to purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Notes, as applicable, under local laws to which a Noteholder may be subject. Each Noteholder must ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.
No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction other than Sweden, where action for that purpose is required. Each Noteholder must inform itself about, and observe, any applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Notes.

the following documents and evidence, in form and substance satisfactory to the Issuing

Agent (acting reasonably):

(a) a copy of a resolution from the board of directors of the Issuer approving the issue of the Additional Notes and resolving to enter into any documents necessary in connection therewith;

(b) a certificate addressed to the Trustee, duly signed by the Issuer, evidencing for the relevant issue of Additional Notes that (i) no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue and (ii) in relation to such issue, the requirements of Condition 11.3 have been complied with; and

(c) such other documents and information as is agreed between the Issuing Agent and the Issuer.

4.2

The Issuing Agent may assume that the documentation delivered to it pursuant to

Condition 4.1 is accurate, correct and complete unless it has actual knowledge that this is

not the case, and the Issuing Agent does not have to verify the contents of any such

documentation.

5.

NOTES IN BOOK-ENTRY FORM

5.1

The Notes will be registered for the Noteholders on their respective Securities Accounts

and no physical notes will be issued. Accordingly, the Notes will be registered in

accordance with the Financial Instruments Accounts Act. Registration requests relating to

the Notes shall be directed to an Account Operator.

5.2

Those who according to assignment, Lien, the provisions of the Swedish Children and

Parents Code foraldrabalken (1949:381)), conditions of will or deed of gift or otherwise

have acquired a right to receive payments in respect of a Note shall register their

entitlements to receive payment in accordance with the Financial Instruments Accounts

Act.

5.3

The Issuer and the Trustee shall at all times be entitled to obtain information from the debt

register (skuldbok) kept by the CSD in respect of the Notes. For the purpose of carrying out

any administrative procedure that arises out of the Finance Documents, the Issuing Agent

shall be entitled to obtain information from the debt register kept by the CSD in respect of

the Notes.

5.4

The Issuer shall issue any necessary power of attorney to such persons employed by the

Trustee, as notified by the Trustee, in order for such individuals to independently obtain

information directly from the debt register kept by the CSD in respect of the Notes. The

26

Issuer may not revoke any such power of attorney unless directed by the Trustee or unless consent thereto is given by the Noteholders.

5.5

The Issuer and the Trustee may use the information referred to in Condition 5.3 and 5.4

only for the purpose of carrying out their duties and exercising their rights in accordance

with the Finance Documents and shall not disclose such information to any Noteholders or

third party unless necessary for such purpose.

6.

RIGHT TO ACT ON BEHALF OF A NOTEHOLDER

6.1

If any person other than a Noteholder wishes to exercise any rights of a Noteholder under

the Finance Documents on behalf of such Noteholder, it must obtain a power of attorney or

other proof of authorisation from the Noteholder or a successive, coherent chain of powers

of attorney or proofs of authorisation starting with the Noteholder and authorising such

person.

6.2

A Noteholder may issue one or several powers of attorney to third parties to represent it in

relation to some or all of the Notes held by it. Any such representative may act

independently under the Finance Documents in relation to the Notes for which such

representative is entitled to represent the Noteholder and may further delegate its right to

represent the Noteholder by way of a further power of attorney.

6.3

The Trustee shall only have to examine the face of a power of attorney or other proof of

authorisation that has been provided to it pursuant to Condition 6.2 and may assume that it

has been duly authorised, is valid, has not been revoked or superseded and that it is in full

force and effect, unless otherwise is apparent from its face or the Trustee has actual

knowledge to the contrary.

7.

PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE NOTES

7.1

Any payment or repayment under the Finance Documents, or any amount due in respect of

a repurchase of any Notes pursuant to these Terms and Conditions, shall be made to such

person who is registered as a Noteholder on the Record Date prior to an Interest Payment

Date or other relevant due date, or to such other person who is registered with the CSD on

such date as being entitled to receive the relevant payment, repayment or repurchase

7.2

If a Noteholder has registered, through an Account Operator, that principal, interest or any

other payment shall be deposited in a certain bank account, such deposits will be effected

by the CSD or the Issuer (or its agent) on the relevant payment date. In other cases,

payments will be transferred by the CSD or the Issuer (or its agent) to the Noteholder at the

address registered with the CSD on the Record Date. Should the CSD, due to a delay on

behalf of the Issuer or some other obstacle, not be able to effect payments as aforesaid, the

Issuer shall promptly provide notice of such non-payment to the Trustee in accordance

with Condition 23 (Notices and Press Releases) and procure that such amounts are paid to

the persons who are registered as Noteholders on the relevant Record Date as soon as

possible after such obstacle has been removed.

7.3

If, due to any obstacle for the CSD, the Issuer cannot make a payment or repayment, such

payment or repayment may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed. Interest

shall accrue in accordance with Condition 8.4 during such postponement.

27

7.4

If payment or repayment is made in accordance with this Condition 7, the Issuer and the

CSD shall be deemed to have fulfilled their obligation to pay, irrespective of whether such

payment was made to a person not entitled to receive such amount. The Trustee shall have

no obligation to ensure any payments or repayments made in accordance with this

Condition 7.4 are actually received by the person entitled to such payment or repayment.

7.5

Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee shall be liable to gross-up any payments under the

in respect of which payment is being made divided by 360 (actual/360-days basis).

8.4

If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it on its due date, default interest shall

accrue on the overdue amount from (but excluding) the due date up to (and including) the

date of actual payment at a rate which is one (1) per cent. higher than the Interest Rate for

Indebtedness together with accrued and unpaid interest if any to the date of purchase) that

The Issuer shall give written notice of its offer to redeem pursuant to Condition 9.5.1 no later than twenty (20) Business Days after the end of the 365 calendar day period referred to in Condition 11.5.1(c).

9.5.5

Upon the commencement of an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will send, by first class

mail, a notice to the Trustee and each of the Noteholders with a copy to the Trustee. The

(d) that, unless the Issuer defaults in making such payment, any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Excess Proceeds Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Purchase Date;

9.5.6

On or before the Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for repurchase, the Offer Amount of Notes tendered pursuant to the Excess Proceeds Offer (which Notes shall be randomly selected by the Issuer or its agent if more than the Offer Amount has been tendered), or if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes tendered. The Issuer will pay each tendering holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the

30

9.5.7 9.6 9.6.1 9.6.2 9.6.3
9.6.4

Notes tendered by such Noteholder and accepted by the Issuer for purchase. Any purchase pursuant to this Condition 9.5 shall not be subject to conditions precedent.
To the extent that the amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Financial Indebtedness purchased pursuant to this Condition 9.5 is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to purchase Notes and such Pari Passu Financial Indebtedness for purposes that are not otherwise prohibited by these Terms and Conditions. Upon completion of each redemption, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero.
Mandatory repurchase due to a Change of Control Triggering Event or a Listing Failure Event (put option)
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event or a Listing Failure Event, each Noteholder shall during a period of twenty (20) Business Days from the effective date of a notice from the Issuer of the Change of Control Triggering Event or Listing Failure Event, as applicable, pursuant to Condition 10.1.2 (after which time period such right shall lapse), have the right to request that all, or some only, of its Notes be repurchased at a price per Note equal to 101 per cent. of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest.

The Redemption Date must fall no later than forty (40) Business Days after the end of the period referred to in Condition 9.6.1.

Such notice shall specify the Redemption Date, the Record Date on which a person shall be registered as a Noteholder to receive the amounts due on such Redemption Date and also include instructions about the actions that a Noteholder needs to take if it wants Notes held by it to be repurchased. If a Noteholder has so requested, and acted in accordance with the instructions in the notice from the Issuer, the Issuer shall repurchase the relevant Notes and the repurchase amount shall fall due on the Redemption Date specified in the notice given by the Issuer pursuant to this Condition 9.6.3. The Redemption Date must fall no later than forty (40) Business Days after the end of the period of twenty (20) Business Days referred to in this Condition 9.6.3.
The Issuer shall comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes. To the extent that the provisions of such laws and regulations conflict with the provisions in this Condition 9.6, the Issuer shall

comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Condition 9.6 by virtue of the conflict.
The Issuer shall not be required to repurchase any Notes pursuant to this Condition 9.6, if a third party in connection with the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event or a Listing Failure Event offers to purchase the Notes in the manner and on the terms set out in this Condition 9.6 (or on terms more favourable to the Noteholders) and purchases all Notes validly tendered in accordance with such offer. If Notes tendered are not purchased within the time limits stipulated in this Condition 9.6, the Issuer shall repurchase any such Notes within five (5) Business Days after the expiry of the time limit.
No repurchase of Notes pursuant to this Condition 9.6 shall be required if the Issuer has given notice of a redemption pursuant to Condition 9.3 (Voluntary total redemption (call option)), provided that such redemption is duly exercised.

The Trustee shall not be liable for any delay (or any related consequences) in crediting an account with an amount required pursuant to the Finance Documents to be paid by the Trustee to the Noteholders, provided that the Trustee has taken all necessary steps as soon as reasonably practicable to comply with the regulations or operating procedures of any recognised clearing or settlement system used by the Trustee for that purpose.
The Trustee shall have no liability to the Noteholders for damage caused by the Trustee acting in accordance with instructions of the Noteholders given in accordance with Condition 14 (Decisions by Noteholders) or a demand by Noteholders given pursuant to Condition 12.1.
Any liability towards the Issuer which is incurred by the Trustee in acting under, or in relation to, the Finance Documents shall not be subject to set-off against the obligations of the Issuer to the Noteholders under the Finance Documents.
Replacement of the Trustee
Subject to Condition 18.4.6, the Trustee may resign by giving notice to the Issuer and the Noteholders, in which case the Noteholders shall appoint a successor Trustee at a Noteholders' Meeting convened by the retiring Trustee or by way of Written Procedure initiated by the retiring Trustee.
Subject to Condition 18.4.6, if the Trustee is Insolvent, the Trustee shall be deemed to resign as Trustee and the Issuer shall within ten (10) Business Days appoint a successor Trustee which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable company which regularly acts as trustee under debt issuances.
A Noteholder (or Noteholders) representing at least ten (10) per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount may, by notice to the Issuer (such notice may only be validly given by a person who is a Noteholder on the Business Day immediately following the day on which the notice is received by the Issuer), require that a Noteholders' Meeting is held for the purpose of dismissing the Trustee and appointing a new Trustee. The Issuer may, at a Noteholders' Meeting convened by it or by way of Written Procedure initiated by it, propose to the Noteholders that the Trustee be dismissed and a new Trustee appointed.

If the Noteholders have not appointed a successor Trustee within ninety (90) days after (i) the earlier of the notice of resignation was given or the resignation otherwise took place or (ii) the Trustee was dismissed through a decision by the Noteholders, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Trustee which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable company which regularly acts as trustee under debt issuances.
The retiring Trustee shall, at its own cost, make available to the successor Trustee such documents and records and provide such assistance as the successor Trustee may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Trustee under the Finance Documents.
The Trustee's resignation or dismissal shall only take effect upon the appointment of a successor Trustee and acceptance by such successor Trustee of such appointment and the execution of all necessary documentation to effectively substitute the retiring Trustee.
Upon the appointment of a successor, the retiring Trustee shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the Finance Documents and remain liable under the Finance Documents in respect of any action which it took or failed to take whilst acting as Trustee. Its successor, the Issuer and each of the Noteholders shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves under the Finance Documents as they would have had if such successor had been the original Trustee.
In the event that there is a change of the Trustee in accordance with this Condition 18.4, the Issuer shall execute such documents and take such actions as the new Trustee may reasonably require for the purpose of vesting in such new Trustee the rights, powers and obligation of the Trustee and releasing the retiring Trustee from its further obligations under the Finance Documents. Unless the Issuer and the new Trustee agree otherwise, the new Trustee shall be entitled to the same fees and the same indemnities as the retiring Trustee.
New Trustee and Separate and Co-Trustees
One or more persons may hold office as trustee or trustees under the Trust Deed but such trustee or trustees shall be or include a trust corporation. The power to appoint a new trustee under the Trust Deed shall be vested in the Issuer but no person shall be appointed who shall not previously have been approved by the Noteholders pursuant to Condition 16.6. Any appointment of a new trustee shall as soon as practicable thereafter be notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee may appoint any person established or resident in any jurisdiction (whether a trust corporation or not) to act either as a separate trustee or as a co-trustee jointly with the Trustee in certain circumstances.
APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THE ISSUING AGENT
The Issuer has appointed the Issuing Agent to manage certain specified tasks under these Terms and Conditions and in accordance with the legislation, rules and regulations applicable to and/or issued by the CSD and relating to the Notes.
The Issuing Agent may retire from its assignment or be dismissed by the Issuer, provided that the Issuer has approved that a commercial bank or securities institution approved by

the CSD accedes as new Issuing Agent at the same time as the old Issuing Agent retires or is dismissed.
APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THE CSD
The Issuer has appointed the CSD to manage certain tasks under these Terms and Conditions and in accordance with the CSD Regulations and the other regulations applicable to the Notes.
The CSD may retire from its assignment or be dismissed by the Issuer, provided that the Issuer has effectively appointed a replacement CSD that accedes as CSD at the same time as the old CSD retires or is dismissed and provided also that the replacement does not have a negative effect on any Noteholder or the listing of the Notes on a Regulated Market. The replacing CSD must be authorised to professionally conduct clearing operations pursuant to the Securities Markets Act (lag (2007:528) om värdepappersmarknaden) and be authorised as a central securities depository in accordance with the Financial Instruments Account Act (lag (1998:1479) om kontoföring avfinansiella instrument).
NO DIRECT ACTIONS BY NOTEHOLDERS
No Noteholder shall itself be entitled to proceed directly against the Issuer unless the Trustee, having become bound to so proceed, fails to do so within a reasonable time and such failure is continuing. Further, a Noteholder may not take any steps whatsoever to enforce or recover any amount due or owing to it pursuant to the Trust Deed and/or the Notes, or to initiate, support or procure the winding-up, dissolution, liquidation, company reorganisation (företagsrekonstruktion) or bankruptcy (konkurs) (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction) of the Issuer in relation to any of the obligations and liabilities of the Issuer under the Trust Deed and/or the Notes. Such steps may only be taken by the Trustee.
PRESCRIPTION
The right to receive repayment of the principal of the Notes shall become prescribed ten (10) years from the Redemption Date. The right to receive payment of interest (excluding any capitalised interest) shall be prescribed and become void five (5) years from the relevant due date for payment. The Issuer is entitled to any funds set aside for payments in respect of which the Noteholders' right to receive payment has been prescribed.
NOTICES AND PRESS RELEASES

Any notice or other communication to be made under or in connection with the Finance Documents:
(a) if to the Trustee, shall be given at Sveavägen 9, 111 57 Stockholm;

Any notice or other communication made by one person to another under or in connection with the Finance Documents shall be sent by way of courier, personal delivery or letter, or, if between the Issuer and the Trustee, by email, and will only be effective, in case of courier or personal delivery, when it has been left at the address specified in Condition 23.1.1, in case of letter, three (3) Business Days after being deposited postage prepaid in an envelope addressed to the address specified in Condition 23.1.1, or, in case of email, when received in readable form by the email recipient.
Any notice pursuant to the Finance Documents shall be in English.
Failure to send a notice or other communication to a Noteholder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Noteholders.
Press releases
Any notice that the Issuer or the Trustee shall send to the Noteholders pursuant to Conditions 9.3 (Voluntary total redemption (Call option)), 9.4 (Early redemption due to illegality), 9.5 (Repurchase with Excess Proceeds), 10.1.2, 12.4, 14.15, 15.1, 16.1 and 17.3 shall also be published by way of press release by the Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable.
In addition to Condition 23.2.1, if any information relating to the Notes or the Issuer contained in a notice the Trustee may send to the Noteholders under these Terms and Conditions has not already been made public by way of a press release, the Trustee shall before it sends such information to the Noteholders give the Issuer the opportunity to issue a press release containing such information. If the Issuer does not promptly issue a press release and the Trustee considers it necessary to issue a press release containing such information before it can lawfully send a notice containing such information to the Noteholders, the Trustee shall be entitled to issue such press release.
FORCE MAJEURE AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Neither the Trustee nor the Issuing Agent shall be held responsible for any damage arising out of any legal enactment, or any measure taken by a public authority, or war, strike, lockout, boycott, blockade, natural disaster, insurrection, civil commotion, terrorism or any other similar circumstance (a "Force Majeure Event"). The reservation in respect of strikes, lockouts, boycotts and blockades applies even if the Trustee or the Issuing Agent itself takes such measures, or is subject to such measures.
The Issuing Agent shall have no liability to the Noteholders if it has observed reasonable care. The Issuing Agent shall never be responsible for indirect damage with exception of gross negligence and wilful misconduct.
Should a Force Majeure Event arise which prevents the Trustee or the Issuing Agent from taking any action required to comply with these Terms and Conditions, such action may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed.
The provisions in this Condition 24 apply unless they are inconsistent with the provisions of the Financial Instruments Accounts Act which provisions shall take precedence.
CONTRACTS (RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES) ACT 1999
No person shall have any right to enforce any term or condition of the Notes under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 except and to the extent, if any, that the Notes
49

expressly provide for such Act to apply to any of their terms. This does not affect any right or remedy of a third party which exists or is available apart from that Act.

25.2

For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuing Agent is intended by the parties to this Agreement

to have the rights under the Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce the

terms of Condition 4 (Condition Precedent)

26.

GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

26.1

The Trust Deed and the Notes, and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in

connection therewith, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English law.

26.2

The Issuer has in the Trust Deed agreed for the benefit of the Trustee and the Noteholders

that the English courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to all disputes arising

out of or in connection with the Trust Deed or the Notes (including claims for set-off and

counterclaims), including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or in connection with:

(i) the creation, validity, effect, interpretation, performance or non-performance of, or the

legal relationships established by the Trust Deed and the Notes; and (ii) any non

contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with the Trust Deed and the Notes

and accordingly submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts. For such

purposes each of the Issuer and the Trustee irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the

English courts and waives any objection to the exercise of such jurisdiction.

26.3

Notwithstanding that, under the Financial Instruments Accounts Act or the operating

procedures, rules and regulations of the CSD, (together, the "Swedish Remedies"), holders

of the Notes may have remedies against the Issuer for non-payment or non-performance

under the Trust Deed and the Notes, a Noteholder must first exhaust all available remedies

in the courts of England and Wales for non-payment or non-performance before any

proceedings may be brought against the Issuer in Sweden in respect of the Swedish

Remedies. Notwithstanding the above, and in this limited respect only, a Noteholder may

not therefore take concurrent proceedings in Sweden.

26.4

The Issuer:

(a) waives any objection to the choice of or submission to the English courts on the grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise as regards proceedings in connection with the Trust Deed and the Notes or any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the Trust Deed and the Notes; and
(b) agrees that a judgment, declaration or order (whether interim or final) of an English court in connection with the Trust Deed and the Notes or any non contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the Trust Deed and the Notes is conclusive and binding on it and may be enforced against it in the courts of any other jurisdiction.

26.5

To the extent permitted by law, the Trustee and the Noteholders may take any suit, action

or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the Trust Deed and the Notes against the

Issuer in any other court of competent jurisdiction.

26.6

If at any time the Issuer ceases to maintain an office at 5thFloor, 610 Chiswick High Road,

London, W4 5RU, United Kingdom or at such other address in England and Wales as the

Issuer may specify by notice in writing to the Trustee to which service of process and any

50

other documents in proceedings in England in connection with the Trust Deed and the Notes, including these Terms and Conditions may be made, the Issuer shall appoint an agent in England to which process and any such documents may be served. Any writ, judgment or other notice of legal process shall be sufficiently served on the Issuer if delivered to it (or, if appointed, such agent) at its address in England for the time being. The Issuer undertakes with the Trustee not to revoke the authority of any such agent without the prior written consent of the Trustee.

26.7

The Issuer agrees that failure by a process agent (howsoever appointed) to notify the Issuer

of the process will not invalidate the proceedings concerned.
