DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES
Dometic Group AB (publ) (the "Issuer") will issue the Notes under an indenture (the "Indenture") between, among others, the Issuer and Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as the trustee (the "Trustee") and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as Security Agent (the "Security Agent"), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. Securities Act").
Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under "--Certain Definitions" have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading "--Certain Definitions". In this description, the term "Issuer" refers only to Dometic Group AB (publ), the term "Intermediary Holding Company" refers only to Dometic Koncern AB and the term "Company" refers only to Dometic Group Services AB and not to any of their respective Subsidiaries.
The Issuer is a public company limited by shares organized under the laws of Sweden. The Issuer has no material business operations and will have no material assets other than the shares in the Intermediary Holding Company and its rights under the Proceeds Loan and at all times, any Intercompany Loan. As a result, the Issuer will be wholly dependent on distributions from its subsidiaries to provide any funds necessary to make any the required payments under the Notes.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this "Description of the Notes" to the Notes include the Notes and any Additional Notes that are issued. The terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture will not incorporate or include any of the provisions of, nor be subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The Security Documents referred to below under the caption "--Collateral'' define the terms of the security that will secure the Notes.
The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, the Notes and the Security Documents. This description does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes and the Security Documents because they, and not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Note and the Security Documents, are available as set forth below under "--Additional Information".
The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under the Indenture.
Brief Description of the Notes The Notes The Notes:  will be general obligations of the Issuer;
 will be pari passu in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;
 will be senior to any future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;
 will be secured by a first-priority pledge over the shares in the Intermediary Holding Company and a first-priority security interest in the Proceeds Loan and any Intercompany Loan; and
 will be effectively subordinated to all obligations of any of the Issuer's subsidiaries.
The operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Issuer depends on the cash flow of Its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. On the Issue Date, none of the Issuer's subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries. Any right of the
113

Issuer to receive assets of any of its Subsidiaries upon that Subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that Subsidiary's creditors. See "Risk Factors--Risks relating to Our Capital Structure and Security--The Issuer is the sole obligor of the Notes, and its subsidiaries will not guarantee its obligations under the Notes; the Notes are structurally subordinated to the debt and liabilities of the subsidiaries of the Issuer. "
As of the Issue Date all of the Issuer's Subsidiaries will be "Restricted Subsidiaries" for purposes of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under the caption "Certain Covenants--Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries", the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as "Unrestricted Subsidiaries" . Most of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture do not apply to Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
Principal, Maturity and Interest The Issuer will issue the Notes in the aggregate principal amount of 314 million. The Notes will mature on June 26, 2019 unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein. The redemption price at maturity is 100.000%. Subject to the covenant described below under "Certain Covenants--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" , the Issuer is permitted to issue Additional Notes under the Indenture from time to time after the Issue Date as PIK Interest (as defined below). Any issuance of Additional Notes is subject to the covenants in the Indenture. The Notes and any Additional Notes that are issued will be treated as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture, including, without limitation, those with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. In connection with the payment of PIK Interest (as defined below) on, and any Additional Amounts with respect to, the Notes, the Issuer is entitled, without the consent of the holders, to issue Additional Notes having the same terms and conditions as the Notes. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the "Notes" for all purposes of the Indenture and in this " Description of the Notes" include references to any Additional Notes that are issued. The Issuer will issue Notes in denominations of 1.00 and integral multiples of 1.00 in excess thereof; provided that the Notes may only be transferred in amounts of 100,000 or greater.
Each Note will bear interest at a rate of 9.500% per annum with respect to Cash Interest (as defined below) and 10.250% per annum with respect to any PIK Interest (as defined below). Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually from the Issue Date or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for, whichever is later. Interest will be payable on each Note on January 3 and July 3 each year, commencing on January 3, 2015. Interest will be payable to holders of record on each Note in respect of the principal amount thereof outstanding as at the immediately preceding December 15 or June 15, as the case may be. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Interest on overdue principal, Cash Interest and PIK Interest, as applicable, will accrue at a rate that is 1.00% per annum higher than the then applicable Cash Interest rate, in the case of overdue principal or Cash Interest, or PIK Interest rate, in the case of overdue PIK Interest, on the Notes. In no event will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided that the Trustee and the Paying Agent will not be responsible for verifying if such rate of interest exceeds the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
Except as provided in the immediately succeeding sentence and the definition of "Applicable Amount", interest on the Notes shall be payable entirely in cash ("Cash Interest"). For any interest period after the first interest period after the Issue Date (and other than the final interest period ending at stated maturity), if the Applicable Amount (as defined below) as determined on the Determination Date (as defined below) for such interest period:
(i) is equal to or exceeds 75%, but is less than 100%, of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest that would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on up to 25% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Notes or by issuing Additional Notes in a principal amount equal to such interest ("PIKInterest")]
114

(ii) is equal to or exceeds 50%, but is less than 75%, of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest that would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on up to 50% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes as PIK Interest;
(iii) is equal to or exceeds 25%, but is less than 50%, of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest that would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on up to 75% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes as PIK Interest; or
(iv) is less than 25% of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest that would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on up to 100% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes as PIK Interest,
provided that, if the average daily balance of cash and Cash Equivalents (net of any amount drawn in cash and outstanding under any revolving credit facility and any other working capital facilities) of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries during the period starting on the 45th day preceding the relevant interest payment date and ending on the 15th day preceding such interest payment date is less than SEK400 million (the "Minimum Cash Balance"), determined on a pro forma basis to give effect to (i) the payment of any Cash Interest payable under the Notes on such interest payment date and (ii) any binding commitment to permanently repay (and cancel any corresponding commitments under) the Senior Facilities Agreement (or any Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge the Senior Facilities Agreement) in cash during the period starting after the 15th day preceding such interest payment date and ending on such interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay PIK Interest on the Notes in such amount so that the Minimum Cash Balance would have been SEK400 million over the same period and determined on the same basis. In such circumstances, the Issuer shall deliver an Officer's Certificate to the Trustee and the relevant Paying Agent (upon which the Trustee and the Paying Agent may conclusively rely) on or prior to the fifth Business Day preceding the relevant interest payment date, which Officer's Certificate shall set forth in reasonable detail the Issuer's determination of such pro forma calculation.
The insufficiency or lack of funds available to the Issuer to pay Cash Interest as required by the preceding paragraph shall not permit the Issuer to pay PIK Interest in respect of any other interest period and the sole right of the Issuer to elect to pay PIK Interest shall be as (and to the extent) provided in the immediately preceding paragraph.
As used herein,
(1) "Applicable Amount" shall be the amount equal to the sum (without duplication) of:
(i) the maximum amount of all dividends, distributions or "permitted payments" (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) that, as of the applicable Determination Date, would be permitted to be paid in cash to the Issuer for the purpose of paying Cash Interest by the Issuer after giving effect to all corporate, shareholder or other comparable actions required in order to make such payment, requirements of applicable law and all restrictions on the ability to make such dividends or distributions that are otherwise permitted by the covenant described under "--Certain Covenants--Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries" (including any restrictions and limitations in the Senior Facilities Agreement, instruments or agreements governing other Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries in existence on the Issue Date or any agreement that amends, modifies, renews, increases, supplements, refunds, replaces or refinances such Indebtedness in the manner permitted by such covenant), pursuant to the "restrictions on movement of cash cash out" covenant in the Senior Facilities Agreement (including any "permitted payment" thereunder) and similar distribution mechanisms contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement and any other instrument or agreement governing Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including pursuant to the "restricted payments" covenant in an indenture (including the "general basket" and "consolidated net income buildup" in
115

respect thereof but excluding the other exceptions in respect thereof)), the incurrence and terms of which do not violate the Indenture, net of all taxes attributable solely to such dividend, distribution or "permitted payment" , if any, and, in each case, without regard to whether any such Restricted Subsidiary shall have any funds available to make any such dividends or distributions; and
(ii) all cash and Cash Equivalents on hand at the Issuer as of such Determination Date (other than any cash and Cash Equivalents on hand at the Issuer that have been distributed to the Issuer and the distribution of which was conditioned (under restrictions on the ability to make such dividends or distributions that are permitted by the covenant described under "--Certain Covenants--Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries") upon such cash and Cash Equivalents being utilized for a purpose other than the payment of Cash Interest (including without limitation any such exception allowing amounts to be distributed to the Issuer solely for the purpose of paying taxes and other corporate and administrative expenses attributable to the Issuer or its consolidated Subsidiaries)), which amount pursuant to this clause (ii) shall in no event be less than 0; provided that there shall be excluded from this clause (ii) any net proceeds from the Notes issued on the Issue Date and any cash and Cash Equivalents on hand to be used for payment of Cash Interest on the interest payment date next succeeding such Determination Date.
If interest on the Notes with respect to an interest period will be paid as PIK Interest, the Issuer shall deliver an Officer's Certificate to the Trustee (copied to the Paying Agent) (upon which the Trustee and Paying Agent may conclusively rely) following the Determination Date but not less than five Business Days prior to the commencement of the relevant interest period in which it is to be applied, which Officer's Certificate shall set forth in reasonable detail the Issuer's determination of each component of this definition and in the case of clause (i) identifying the applicable restriction (s) and the maximum amount of funds that may be paid after giving effect to such restriction. To the extent the Issuer is required to pay Cash Interest, the Issuer shall and shall cause each of the Restricted Subsidiaries to take all such shareholder, corporate and other actions necessary or appropriate to permit the making of any such dividends or distribution (or, by virtue of the immediately following paragraph, loans or advances), provided that any such shareholder and corporate and other actions would not violate applicable law; and
(2) "Determination Date" shall mean, with respect to each interest period, the 15th calendar day immediately prior to the first day of the relevant interest period.
In the event that the Issuer shall be entitled to pay PIK Interest for any interest period, then the Issuer shall deliver a notice to the Trustee (copied to the Paying Agent) following the Determination Date but not less than five Business Days prior to the commencement of the relevant interest period, which notice shall state the total amount of interest to be paid on such interest payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid as PIK Interest. The Trustee shall promptly deliver the same notice to the holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of such notice to the Trustee shall not restrict the Issuer's ability to pay, at its option, a greater portion of the interest on the Notes with respect to such interest period as Cash Interest. Interest for the first interest period commencing on the Issue Date shall be payable entirely as Cash Interest. Interest for the final interest period ending at stated maturity shall be payable entirely as Cash Interest.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the payment of accrued interest in connection with any redemption or repurchase of the Notes as described under "--Optional Redemption", "--Repurchase at the Option of Holders--Change of Control" and "--Repurchase at the Option of Holders--Asset Sales", will be made solely in cash.
The ability of the Restricted Subsidiaries to make dividends, distributions or "permitted payments" to the Issuer pursuant to the Senior Facilities Agreement or other instruments or agreements governing other Indebtedness of the Issuer and Subsidiaries is subject to important exceptions.

See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements" and "Risk Factors--Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure--The Issuer is the sole obligor of the Notes, and its subsidiaries will not guarantee its obligations under the Notes; the Notes are structurally subordinated to the debt and liabilities of the subsidiaries of the Issuer. "
As of March 31, 2014, on a pro forma basis to give effect to the Offering and the Refinancing, we have satisfied the relevant "permitted payment" test under our Senior Facilities Agreement to pay the first interest period on the Notes entirely in cash. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Senior Facilities--Permitted payment tests." The calculation of "permitted payments" is based on specific performance requirements on both a historical and forward looking basis, as a result, such "permitted payments" capacity is not necessarily an indication of our cash position on such date or any date in the future.
Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a "Paying Agent) for the Notes in each of (i) the City of London (the "Principal Paying Agent") and (ii) Luxembourg for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market if the rules require. The Issuer will ensure that it maintains a Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing, or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive. The initial Paying Agents will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch in London and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. in Luxembourg.
The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a "Registrar") with offices in Luxembourg, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market. The Issuer will also maintain a transfer agent in each of London and Luxembourg. The initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. The initial transfer agents will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch in London and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. in Luxembourg. The Registrar, Paying Agents and transfer agents, as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein) outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of Definitive Registered Notes on the behalf of the Issuer.
The Issuer may change the Paying Agents, the Registrar or the transfer agents without prior notice to the holders of Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).
Transfer and Exchange Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the " 144A Global Notes"), and Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "Reg S Global Notes" and together with the 144A Global Notes, the "Global Notes").
Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the "Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under "Transfer Restrictions". In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to customary
117

procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.
Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note, or the "Restricted Book-Entry Interest", may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note, as applicable, or the "Reg S Book-Entry Interests", only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.
Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of 1.00 and integral multiples of 1.00 in excess thereof (provided that the Notes may only be transferred in amounts of 100,000 or greater), upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a BookEntry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Company in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under "Notice to Investors".
Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of 1.00 and integral multiples of 1.00 in excess thereof (provided that the Notes may only be transferred in amounts of 100,000 or greater), to persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions and pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange; provided that, if the Company or any Guarantor is a party to the transfer or exchange, the holder will not be required to pay such Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive Registered Notes:
(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;
(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;
(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or
(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.
Additional Amounts All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Issuer is then incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident
118

for tax purposes or any political subdivision thereof or therein or (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the Issuer (including the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent) or any political subdivision thereof or therein (each, a "Tax Jurisdiction") will at any time be required to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes, including payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, the Issuer will pay such additional amounts (the "Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder after such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:
(1) any Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the holder or the beneficial owner of the Notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, the relevant holder, if the relevant holder is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including being or having been a citizen, resident, or national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein), but excluding any connection arising merely from the holding of such Note, the enforcement of rights under such Note or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note;
(2) any Taxes imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);
(3) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;
(4) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to an individual that are required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive;
(5) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner of Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;
(6) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to, the Notes;
(7) any Taxes imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of Notes, following the Issuer's written request (made at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request), to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation);
(8) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer to the holder if such holder is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had such holder been the sole beneficial owner of such Note; or
119

(9) any Taxes withheld or deducted pursuant to an agreement described in Section 1471 (b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or otherwise pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or any law implementing an intergovernmental approach thereto; or
(10) any combination of items (1) through (8) above.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, any amounts to be paid on the Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer, will be paid net of any deduction or withholding imposed or required pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471 (b) of the Code, or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such Sections of the Code ("FATCA Withholding"). Neither the Issuer nor any other person will be required to pay Additional Amounts on account of any FATCA Withholding.
The Issuer may pay such Additional Amounts, at its option, in the form of cash or Additional Notes.
In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer will also pay and indemnify the holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture or any other document referred to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes after this offering) or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, or any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Notes.
If the Issuer becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agents on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer shall notify the Trustee and the Paying Agents promptly thereafter) an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer's Certificates must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee and the Paying Agents shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
The Issuer will make or cause to be made all withholdings and deductions required by law and will timely remit or cause to be remitted the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer will furnish to the Trustee (or to a holder upon written request), within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer, or if, notwithstanding the Issuer's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by the Issuer.
Whenever in the Indenture or in this "Description of the Notes" there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer is incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment on the Notes and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.
120

Security The Notes will be secured by:
(1) a first-priority pledge over the shares in the Intermediary Holding Company (the "Share Pledge"); and
(2) a first-priority pledge over the Proceeds Loan and any Intercompany Loan (the "Loan Pledge").
The Company and the Security Agent will enter into the Share Pledge and the Loan Pledge, which define the terms of security interests that secure the Notes. The Share Pledge and the Loan Pledge will secure the payment and performance when due of all of the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes as provided in the Security Documents.
So long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and subject to certain terms and conditions, the Issuer will be entitled to receive all cash dividends, interest and other payments made upon or with respect to the shares of the Intermediary Holding Company pledged by it and to exercise any voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the shares of the Intermediary Holding Company pledged by it.
The Indenture will provide that the Security Documents may be enforced only upon an acceleration of the amounts due under the Notes following an Event of Default. The Security Agent will enter into the Security Documents in its own name for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes. Neither the Trustee nor the holders of the Notes may, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The holders of the Notes may only take action through the Security Agent.
The Collateral will be released:
(1) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes; or
(2) upon legal defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes as provided below under the captions "--Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance" and "--Satisfaction and Discharge".
Optional Redemption At any time prior to June 26, 2016, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Indenture, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to 109.500% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption (subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date), with the net cash proceeds of an Equity Offering of (i) the Issuer or (ii) any Parent Entity of the Issuer to the extent the proceeds from such Equity Offering are contributed to the Issuer's common equity capital or are paid to the Issuer as consideration for the issuance of ordinary shares of the Issuer; provided that:
(1) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the Indenture (calculated after giving effect to issuance of Additional Notes with respect to the Notes originally issued under the Indenture excluding Notes held by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and
(2) the redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.
At any time prior to June 26, 2016, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.
121

Except pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs and except pursuant to "--Redemption for Changes in Taxes", the Notes will not be redeemable at the Issuer's option prior to June 26, 2016.

On or after June 26, 2016, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on June 26 of the years indicated below, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date:

Year

Redemption Price

2016

102.0000%

2017 ...................................................................................................................................... 101.0000%

2018 and thereafter.......................................................................................................... 100.0000%

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

Any redemption and notice may, in the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including that the Issuer or any Paying Agent has received sufficient funds from the Issuer to pay the full redemption price payable to the holders of the Notes on or before the relevant redemption date.

Redemption for Changes in Taxes
The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at the Issuer's discretion at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in "--Selection and Notice"), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a "Tax Redemption Date") and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes, the Issuer is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts, and the Issuer cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it, and the requirement arises as a result of:
(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment is announced and becomes effective on or after the date of this offering memorandum; or
(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or application of such laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which amendment or change is announced and becomes effective on or after the date of this offering memorandum.
The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts or the relevant additional amounts must remain in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that there has been such amendment or change which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that it cannot

122

avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by the relevant entity taking reasonable measures available to it.
The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Notes.
Mandatory Redemption The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
Repurchase at the Option of Holders Change of Control If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to 1.00 and integral multiples of 1.00 in excess thereof (provided that the Notes may only be transferred in amounts of 100,000 or greater) of that holder's Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"), subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice ("Change of Control Offer") to each holder of the Notes at such holder's registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under "--Selection and Notice", stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Notes on the date (the "Change of Control Payment Date") specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice.
The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with any applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:
(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the Issuer.
The Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.
123

The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.
The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption "--Optional Redemption" , unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.
The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of "all or substantially all" of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all", there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.
The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control.
If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).
Asset Sales The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:
(1) the Issuer (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and
(2) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:
(a) any liabilities, as recorded on the balance sheet of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities), that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and as a result of which the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with respect to such liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities;
(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted
124

Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;
(c) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (1)(b) or (d) of the next paragraph of this covenant;
(d) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sales having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (d) that has not at that time been converted into cash or Cash Equivalents, not to exceed the greater of 55.0 million and 3.0% of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value);
(e) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale; and
(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer received from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary.
Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may:
(1) apply such Net Proceeds (at the option of the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary):
(a) to repay any Indebtedness outstanding under a Credit Facility, Senior Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary and if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;
(b) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, an entity operating a Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;
(c) to make a capital expenditure;
(d) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) not classified as current assets under IFRS that replace the assets that were the subject of the Asset Sale or are used or useful in a Permitted Business; or
(2) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Proceeds pursuant to clause (b), (c) or (d) of clause (1) above; provided that such binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such acquisition or expenditure is consummated, and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period.
Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.
Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant will constitute "Excess Proceeds". When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds 20.0 million, within ten Business Days thereof, the Issuer will make an offer (an "Asset Sale Offer") to all holders of Notes, to make an offer to all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses,
125

including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds.
The offer price for the Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into (or to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds so applied, the Trustee will select the Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness, if applicable, to be purchased on a pro rata basis (or in the manner described under "--Selection and Notice"), based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.
The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control or Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control or Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
Selection and Notice If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the Registrar will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under "Book-Entry, Delivery and Form", based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. Neither the Trustee nor the Registrar shall be liable for selections made by them in accordance with this paragraph.
No Notes in aggregate principal amount of 100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.
For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Notes shall also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.

Certain Covenants Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the Issuer will not issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however, that the Company may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock, and the Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue preferred stock, if on the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or such preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, the Company's Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or the preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period.
The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, "Permitted Debt):
(1) the incurrence by the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness under Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) not to exceed the greater of 700.0 million and SEK6.4 billion, plus in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing, less the aggregate amount of all Net Proceeds of Asset Sales applied by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue Date to permanently repay any Indebtedness under a Credit Facility and effect a corresponding commitment reduction thereunder pursuant to the covenant described above under the caption "--Repurchase at the Option of the Holders-- Asset Sales"]
(2) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue Date after giving effect to the use of proceeds of the Notes;
(3) the incurrence by the Issuer of Indebtedness under (i) the Notes issued on the Issue Date, and (ii) an unlimited principal amount of Additional Notes issued from time to time in payment of accrued interest or Additional Amounts on the Notes;

(5) the incurrence by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was permitted by the Indenture to be incurred under the first paragraph of this covenant or clauses (2), (3) or (5) of this paragraph;
(6) the incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of intercompany Indebtedness to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that:
127

(e) if the Issuer is the obligor on such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness must be unsecured and expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations then due with respect to the Notes; and
(f) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (6);
(7) the issuance by any Restricted Subsidiary to the Issuer or to any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of preferred stock; provided that:
(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such preferred stock being held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; and
(b) any sale or other transfer of any such preferred stock to a Person that is not either the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary,
will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an issuance of such preferred stock by such Restricted Subsidiary that was not permitted by this clause (7);
(8) the incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Hedging Obligations for bona fide hedging purposes of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the board of directors or senior management of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary as the case may be);

(12) the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary providing for customary indemnification, obligations in respect of earnouts or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar obligations, in each case, incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business or assets or Person or any Equity Interests of a Subsidiary, provided that the maximum liability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the Fair Market Value of non cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition;
(13) the incurrence by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness in respect of (A) letters of credit, surety, performance or appeal bonds, completion guarantees, judgment, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax guarantees or similar instruments issued in the ordinary course of business of such Person and not in connection with the borrowing of money, including letters of credit or similar instruments in respect of self-insurance and workers compensation obligations, (B) any customary cash management, cash pooling or netting or setting off arrangements and (C) the financing of insurance premiums in the ordinary course of
128

business; provided, however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or other instrument, such obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing;

(17) Indebtedness of the Issuer the net proceeds of which are concurrently irrevocably and unconditionally deposited to optionally redeem in full or repay in full all of the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes or to discharge in full and defease in full the Notes;
(18) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (18) not to exceed 50.0 million;
(19) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under local overdraft and other local working capital facilities in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed, at any one time outstanding, 25.0 million;

129

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral. Intermediary Holding Company will not Incur any Indebtedness other than pursuant to clauses (2), (5) (solely to the extent the Intermediary Holding Company is the obligor on the Indebtedness being refinanced), (6), (7), (8), (9) (solely to the extent it constitutes a guarantee of Indebtedness under clause (1)), (10), (11), (13), (14) or (15) of the definition of Permitted Debt.
For purposes of determining compliance with this "Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Indebtedness described in this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, and from time to time to reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant, provided that Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt may not be reclassified. Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided in clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt.
The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred; provided, however, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated in noneuro currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement with respect to euro the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the euro equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the euro equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally incurred, except that to the extent that:
(1) such euro-equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in which case the Refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence; and
(2) the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the euro-equivalent of such excess will be determined on the date such refinancing Indebtedness is being incurred.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.
The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:
130

(1) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS;
(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and
(3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of:
(i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and
(ii) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.
Restricted Payments The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:
(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the Issuer's or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of the Issuer's or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests in their capacity as holders (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer and other than dividends or distributions payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary);
(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Issuer) any Equity Interests of the Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer;
(3) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Indebtedness of the Issuer that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (excluding any intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), except (i) a payment of interest or principal at the Stated Maturity thereof or (ii) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a scheduled sinking fund obligation, principal installment or scheduled maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of such purchase, repurchase or other acquisition;
(4) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Debt; or
(5) make any Restricted Investment
(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through (5) above being collectively referred to as "Restricted Payments").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may make a Restricted Investment (other than an Investment in a Parent Entity and other than an Investment in an Affiliate of the Issuer for the purpose of declaring or paying any dividend or making any other payment or distribution on account of the Issuer's or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests or to the direct or indirect holders of the Issuer's or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests in their capacity as holders or purchasing, redeeming or otherwise acquiring or retiring for value any Equity Interests of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent entity of the Issuer (each, an "Indirect Restricted Payment")) if, at the time of and after giving pro forma effect to such Restricted Investment:
(a) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such Restricted Investment;
(b) the Company would, at the time of such Restricted Investment and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Restricted Investment had been made at the beginning of the applicable four-
131

quarter period, have been permitted to incur at least 1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption "--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock"-, and
(c) such Restricted Investment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue Date (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (2), (3), (5), (6), (7), (8), (12), (14) and (17) of the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum, without duplication, of:
(i) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period) from the beginning of the fiscal quarter commencing immediately prior to the Issue Date to the end of the Issuer's most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Investment (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit); plus
(ii) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the Fair Market Value of marketable securities received by the Issuer since the Issue Date as a contribution to its common equity capital or from the issue or sale of Equity Interests of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock and Excluded Contributions) or from the issue or sale of convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or convertible or exchangeable debt securities of the Issuer, in each case that have been converted into or exchanged for Equity Interests of the Issuer (other than Equity Interests and convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock or debt securities sold to a Subsidiary of the Issuer) or from the issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Debt (other than an issuance or sale to a Subsidiary of the Issuer); plus

(iv) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Issuer designated as such after the Issue Date is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged or consolidated into the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or all of the assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary are transferred to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, the Fair Market Value of the property received by the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary or the Issuer's Restricted Investment in such Subsidiary as of the date of such redesignation, merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, to the extent such Investments reduced the Restricted Payments capacity under this clause (c) and were not previously repaid or otherwise reduced; plus
(v) upon the full and unconditional release of a Restricted Investment that is a Guarantee made by the Issuer or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person, an amount equal to the amount of such Guarantee; plus
(vi) 100% of any cash dividends or distributions received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent that such dividends or distributions were not otherwise included in the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for such period.
The preceding provisions of this covenant will not prohibit:
(1) the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any redemption within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend or giving of the redemption notice, as the case may be, if at the date of declaration or notice, the dividend or redemption payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture;
132

(2) the making of any Restricted Investment in exchange for, or out of or with the net cash proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale or issuance (other than to a Subsidiary of the Issuer) of, Equity Interests of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock), Subordinated Shareholder Debt or from the substantially concurrent contribution of common equity capital to the Issuer; provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that are utilized for any such Restricted Investment will be excluded from the calculation of amounts under clause (c) (ii) of the preceding paragraph, shall not constitute Excluded Contributions and will not be considered to be net cash proceeds from a Equity Offering for purposes of the "Optional Redemption" provisions described above;
(3) the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness of the Issuer that is contractually subordinated to the Notes with the net cash proceeds from an incurrence of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness;
(4) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Equity Interests of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary held by any current or former officer, director, employee or consultant of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to any equity subscription agreement, stock option agreement, restricted stock grant, shareholders' agreement or similar agreement; provided that the aggregate price paid for all such repurchased, redeemed, acquired or retired Equity Interests may not exceed 7.5 million in any calendar year, provided that any unused amounts with respect to such limit may be carried forward to the following calendar year, subject to an overall limit of 15.0 million in any calendar year; and provided, further, that such amount in any calendar year may be increased by an amount not to exceed the cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary during such calendar year, in each case to members of management, directors or consultants of the Issuer, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any of its direct or indirect parent companies to the extent the cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests have not otherwise been applied to the making of Restricted Investments pursuant to clause (c) (ii) of the preceding paragraph or clause (2) of this paragraph;
(5) the repurchase of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon the exercise of stock options to the extent such Equity Interests represent a portion of the exercise price of those stock options;

(9) advances or loans to (a) any future, present or former officer, director, employee or consultant of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to pay for the purchase or other acquisition for value of Equity Interests of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock), or any obligation under a forward sale agreement, deferred purchase agreement or deferred payment arrangement pursuant to any management equity plan or stock option plan or any other management or employee benefit or incentive plan or other agreement or arrangement or (b) any management equity plan or stock option plan or any other management or employee benefit or incentive plan or unit trust or the trustees of any such plan or trust to pay for the purchase or other acquisition for value of Equity Interests of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock); provided that the total aggregate amount of
133

Restricted Payments made under this clause (9) does not exceed 7.5 million in any calendar year;
(10) the payment of any dividend (or, in the case of any partnership or limited liability company, any similar distribution) by a Restricted Subsidiary to the holders of its Equity Interests (other than the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) on no more than a pro rata basis;

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment.
Liens The Issuer will not and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind securing Indebtedness upon any of their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, except Permitted Liens, unless all payments due under the Indenture and the Notes are secured on an equal and ratable basis with the obligations so secured until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) no Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, other than the Notes, may be secured by a Lien over the Collateral other than Permitted Collateral Liens and (2) no Indebtedness which is subordinated in right of payment to Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement may be secured by a Lien.
134

Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:
(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;
(2) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or
(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
provided that (x) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill period to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.
However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:
(1) agreements governing Indebtedness and Credit Facilities as in effect on the Issue Date and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the Issue Date;
(2) the Indenture and the Security Documents;
(3) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under "Certain Covenants--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement, as in effect on the Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);
(4) applicable law, rule, regulation or order or the terms of any license, authorization, concession or permit;
(5) any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness or Capital Stock was incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred;
(6) customary non-assignment and similar provisions in contracts, leases and licenses entered into in the ordinary course of business;
(7) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business and Capital Lease Obligations that impose restrictions on the property purchased or leased of the nature described in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph;
135

(8) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock or all or substantially all of the property and assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;
(9) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;
(10) Liens permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described above under the caption "--Liens" that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;
(11) customary provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements in the ordinary course of business (including agreements entered into in connection with a Restricted Investment), which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements;
(12) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or suppliers or required by insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case, under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business;
(13) any encumbrance or restriction effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Transaction or other factoring transactions; and
(14) any encumbrance or restriction existing under any agreement that extends, renews, refinances or replaces the agreements containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing clauses (1) through (13), or in this clause (14); provided that the terms and conditions of any such encumbrances or restrictions are no more restrictive in any material respect than those under or pursuant to the agreement so extended, renewed, refinanced or replaced.
Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets The Issuer will not directly or indirectly: (i) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving corporation), or (ii) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:
(1) either: (a) the Issuer is the surviving corporation; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made is an entity organized or existing under the laws of any member state of the Pre-Expansion European Union, Switzerland, Canada, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;
(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger with the Issuer (if other than the Issuer) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made assumes all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture;
(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;
(4) the Issuer or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made would, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period (i) be permitted to incur at least 1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption "--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" or (ii) have a Consolidated Leverage Ratio less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and
136

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel, in each case, stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture comply with this covenant.
In addition, the Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of the properties and assets of it and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to any other Person.
Clauses (3) and (4) of the first paragraph of this "Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets" covenant will not apply to any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of the Issuer with or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction for tax reasons.
Transactions with Affiliates The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each, an "Affiliate Transaction") involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of 2.5 million, unless:
(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and
(2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee:
(a) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of 5.0 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer set forth in an Officer's Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with this covenant and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer; and, in addition,
(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of 15.0 million, an opinion of an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of international standing, or other recognized independent expert of international standing with experience appraising the terms and conditions of the type of transaction or series of related transactions for which an opinion is required, stating that the transaction or series of related transactions is (i) fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate.
The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:
(1) any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement, consultant, employee benefit arrangements with any employee, consultant, officer or director of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, including under any stock option, stock appreciation rights, stock incentive or similar plans, entered into in the ordinary course of business;
(2) transactions between or among the Issuer and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries;
(3) transactions in the ordinary course of business with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Issuer) that is an Affiliate of the Issuer solely because the Issuer owns, directly or through a Restricted Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person;
137

(4) payment of reasonable and customary fees and reimbursements of expenses (pursuant to indemnity arrangements or otherwise) of Officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;
(5) any issuance of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer to Affiliates of the Issuer;
(6) any Investment (other than a Permitted Investment) or other Restricted Payment, in either case, that does not violate the covenant described under the caption "--Restricted Payments" ;
(7) Management Advances;
(8) any Permitted Investments (other than Permitted Investments described in clauses (3) and (15) of the definition thereof);
(9) the incurrence of any Subordinated Shareholder Debt;
(10) transactions pursuant to, or contemplated by any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and transactions pursuant to any amendment, modification or extension to such agreement, so long as such amendment, modification or extension, taken as a whole, is not more disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes than the original agreement as in effect on the Issue Date;
(11) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture that are fair to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person;
(12) execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of business; and
(13) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Transaction or other factoring transaction.
Maintenance of Listing The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Euro MTF market for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer determines that they will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Euro MTF market, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on another "recognized stock exchange" as defined in 841 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 of the United Kingdom.
Payments for Consent The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture, to exclude holders of Notes in any jurisdiction where (i) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (ii) the payment of the consideration therefor would require the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the
138

United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent documents) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (B) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.
Lines of Business The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a Permitted Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indenture to the contrary, the Issuer and Intermediary Holding Company will not:
(1) engage in any business activity or undertake any other activity except (i) in the case of the Issuer, Holding Company Activities and any activity relating to the offering, sale, issuance, interest rate hedging, servicing and refinancing of the Notes and (ii) in the case of the Intermediary Holding Company, Holding Company Activities and any activity relating to its guarantee under the Senior Facilities Agreement; or
(2) incur and material liabilities not directly related to acting as a holding company.
Impairment of Security Interest The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission might or would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes, and the Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the Indenture, the Security Documents and (b) the Issuer may incur Permitted Collateral Liens; and provided further, however, that no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced or released, unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee either (1) a solvency opinion from an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release or (2) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes created under the Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced, released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, and that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release.
At the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the holders of the Notes, the Security Agent may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security Documents to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (ii) (but subject to compliance with paragraph (a)
139

above) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens, (iii) add to the Collateral or (iv) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Notes in any material respect.
In the event that the Issuer complies with this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement with no need for instructions from holders of the Notes.

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer, beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2014, quarterly reports of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the quarterly and year to date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods for the Issuer, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information, together with explanatory footnotes, for any acquisitions or dispositions (including, without limitation, any acquisitions or dispositions that, individually or in the aggregate when considered with all other acquisitions or dispositions that have occurred since the beginning of the most recent completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report relates, represents greater than 20% of the consolidated revenues, EBITDA or assets of the Issuer on a pro forma basis) or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report relates; (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements (including a discussion by business segment, if any), including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and any material change between the current quarterly period and the corresponding period of the prior year; and (d) material recent developments in the business of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries;
140

(3) promptly after the occurrence of (a) a material acquisition, disposition or restructuring (including any acquisition or disposition that would require the delivery of pro forma financial information pursuant to clauses (1) or (2) above); (b) any senior management change at the Issuer or any of its Significant Subsidiaries; (c) any change in the auditors of the Issuer; (d) any resignation of a member of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any of its Significant Subsidiaries as a result of a disagreement with the Issuer or such Significant Subsidiaries; (e) the entering into an agreement that will result in a Change of Control; or (f) any material events that the Issuer or any of its Significant Subsidiaries announces publicly, in each case, a report containing a description of such events; and
(4) if the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Subsidiaries are Significant Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding clauses will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer;
provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) above will not be required to (i) contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or (ii) include separate financial statements for any guarantor and non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Issuer.
All financial statements required by this covenant shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS.
For so long as any Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g32(b), the Issuer has agreed that it will, furnish to the holders of the Notes and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.
The Issuer will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant (i) on the Issuer's website and (ii) if and so long as the Notes are listed on any exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, at the specified office of the paying agent in the jurisdiction of such exchange.
Collateral The Issuer will at its own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may reasonably require (1) for registering any Security Documents in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security Documents; and (2) if such Security Documents have become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Documents and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of those assets. The Issuer will execute all transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give all notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may reasonably request.
The Issuer will not dispose of or otherwise transfer, and will not permit Intermediary Holding Company to issue, any of Capital Stock of Intermediary Holding Company (other than, if necessary, shares of Capital Stock constituting directors' or other legally required qualifying shares) to any Person, unless immediately after giving effect to such issuance, sale or other disposition, 100% of Intermediary Holding Company's Capital Stock is part of the Collateral.
Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the
141

Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under "Certain Covenants--Restricted Payments" or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Issuer may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Agent by filing with the Agent a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer's Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted under "Certain Covenants--Restricted Payments".
If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under "Certain Covenants--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" , the Issuer will be in default of such covenant.
The Board of Directors of the Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under "Certain Covenants--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" , calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
Events of Default and Remedies Each of the following is an "Event of Default
(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to the Notes;

(x) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, such Indebtedness at the Stated Maturity thereof prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a "Payment Default")-, or
(y) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity,
142

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates 25.0 million or more;
(6) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay final judgments entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of 25.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments shall not have been discharged or waived and there shall have been a period of 60 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of an appeal, waiver or otherwise, shall not have been in effect;

(a) is for relief against the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in an involuntary case;

and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days.
Remedies under the Indenture In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to the Issuer, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or
143

notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.
Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default, of which a responsible office of the Trustee has written notice, occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except (subject to the provisions described under "-- Amendment, Supplement and Waiver") to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:
(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
(2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3) such holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;
(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
(5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.
The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding may, on behalf of the holders of all outstanding Notes, waive any past default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of premium, if any, any Additional Amounts or interest on any Note held by a non-consenting holder (which may only be waived with the consent of each holder of Notes affected).
The Issuer are each required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture.
No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under applicable securities laws.
Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance The Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officer's Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes discharged ("Legal Defeasance") except for:
144

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts) or premium, if any, on, such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;
(2) the Issuer's obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;
(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer's obligations in connection therewith; and
(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.
In addition, the Issuer may elect to have the obligations of the Issuer released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation to make Change of Control Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Indenture ("Covenant Defeasance") and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all Events of Default described under "--Events of Default and Remedies" (except those relating to payments on the Notes or, solely with respect to the Issuer, bankruptcy or insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:
(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee (or an Agent designated for such purpose), in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in euros, non-callable European Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euros and non-callable European Government Obligations, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts and premium, if any) on the outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a particular redemption date;
(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion reasonably acceptable to the Trustee of United States counsel confirming that (a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion reasonably acceptable to the Trustee of United States counsel confirming that the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
(4) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer or others; and
(5) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel, subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.
145

Amendment, Supplement and Waiver Except as provided otherwise in the succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes and the Security Documents, may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Security Documents, may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).
Unless consented to by the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), without the consent of each holder of Notes affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting holder):
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described above under the caption "--Repurchase at the Option of Holders")-,
(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Note;
(4) impair the right of any holder of Notes to receive payment of principal of and interest on such holder's Notes on or after the due dates therefore or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder's Notes;
(5) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or premium, if any, on, the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the Payment Default that resulted from such acceleration);
(6) make any Note payable in currency other than that stated in the Notes;
(7) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or premium, if any, on, the Notes;
(8) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by one of the covenants described above under the caption "--Repurchase at the Option of Holders")]
(9) change the ranking of the Notes;
(10) release any Collateral granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Security Documents; or
(11) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.
Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent (as applicable) may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes and the Security Documents:
(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;
(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;
146

(3) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such holder in any material respect;
(4) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Guarantees, the Security Documents, or the Notes to any provision of this Description of the Notes to the extent that such provision in this Description of the Notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Guarantees, the Security Documents, or the Notes;
(5) to enter into additional or supplemental Security Documents;
(6) to release the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;
(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the Indenture as of the Issue Date; or
(8) to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee under the Indenture.
The consent of the holders of Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.
The Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an opinion of counsel and an Officer's Certificate.
Satisfaction and Discharge The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder, when:
(1) either:
(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders, cash in euros, non-callable European Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euros and non-callable European Government Obligations, in amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;
(2) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and
(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be.
In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).
147

Judgment Currency Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in euros which is made to or for the account of any holder or the Trustee in lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the "Judgment Currency"), whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the liquidation of the Issuer, shall constitute a discharge of the Issuer's obligation under the Indenture and the Notes only to the extent of the amount of euros with such holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, could purchase in the London foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Judgment Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first Business Day following receipt of the payment in the Judgment Currency. If the amount of euros that could be so purchased is less than the amount of euros originally due to such holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, the Issuer shall indemnify and hold harmless the holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, from and against all loss or damage arising out of, or as a result of, such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in the Indenture or the Notes, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any holder or the Trustee from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.
Concerning the Trustee The Issuer shall deliver written notice to the Trustee within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default. If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer, the Indenture limits the right of the Trustee to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee.
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default, of which a responsible office of the Trustee has written notice, occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.
The Issuer will indemnify the Trustee for certain claims, liabilities and expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful default or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with its duties.
