29
12. Priority of the Super Senior Debt and the Senior Debt
The relationship between the PIK Bondholders and the creditors in respect of the Super Senior Debt and the Senior Debt will be governed by the Intercreditor Agreement, which, among other things, will implement the following principles:
(a) Priority of the Super Senior Debt and the Senior Debt with respect to Enforcement Proceeds
Any Enforcement Proceeds will first be applied towards repayment of the Financial Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer under the Super Senior Debt, secondly towards redemption of the Senior Bonds and thirdly towards redemption of the PIK Bonds.
(b) Consultation period before enforcement of Shared Security
If Conflicting Enforcement Instructions (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) are provided by the Representatives to the Security Agent, the Representatives must enter into consultations for a period of not less than thirty (30) calendar days as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (unless such consultation is waived by the Representatives).

Should the PIK Agent not receive such information, the PIK Agent is entitled to assume that no such event or circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the PIK Agent does not have actual knowledge of such event or circumstance.
(f) The Issuer is only obliged to inform the PIK Agent according to this Clause 13.1 if informing the PIK Agent would not conflict with any applicable laws or, when the PIK Bonds are listed, the Issuer's registration contract with the Regulated Market. If such a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with the Regulated Market or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek approval from the Regulated Market or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the PIK Agent, in order to be able to timely inform the PIK Agent according to this Clause 13.1.
13.2 Information from the PIK Agent
Subject to the restrictions of any applicable law and regulation, the PIK Agent is entitled to disclose to the PIK Bondholders any event or circumstance directly or indirectly relating to the Issuer or the PIK Bonds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the

(A) 6.50:1 from, and including, the First Issue Date to, but excluding, the date falling 30 months after the First Issue Date;
(B) 6.00:1 from, and including, the date falling 30 months after the First Issue Date to, but excluding, the Maturity Date; and

The Leverage Ratio shall be calculated as follows:
(a) The calculation shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no earlier than in the period one month prior to the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness or the making of a Restricted Payment.
(b) The amount of Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date, however that
(i) the full commitment of any new Financial Indebtedness in respect of which the Incurrence Test shall be made (after deducting any Financial

32
Indebtedness which shall be refinanced at the time of incurrence of such new Financial Indebtedness) shall be added to the Net Interest Bearing Debt; and
(ii) any cash balance/proceeds resulting from the incurrence of such new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt.
14.3 Adjustments to EBITDA
The figures for EBITDA for the Relevant Period ending in the last day of the period covered by the most recent Financial Report (including when necessary, financial statements published before the First Issue Date), shall be used, but adjusted so that:
(a) entities acquired or disposed of by the Group during the Relevant Period, or after the end of the Relevant Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be included or excluded (as applicable), pro forma, for the entire Relevant Period;
(b) any entity to be acquired with the proceeds from the new Financial Indebtedness shall be included, pro forma, for the entire Relevant Period; and
(c) the full run rate effect of all cost savings and cost synergies reasonably projected by the Issuer as being obtainable during the twelve (12) month period following the date of the completion of such acquisition shall be taken into account, provided that the aggregate amount of such cost savings and cost synergies may (for such purposes) not exceed the higher of:
(i) EUR 1,300,000; and
(ii) ten (10) per cent. of the pro forma EBITDA (as per (a) above) in the Relevant Period,
unless the aggregate amount of such cost savings and cost synergies is independently verified by the auditor or a reputable independent third party advisor to the Issuer (and a copy of the relevant report providing such certification must be delivered with the relevant Compliance Certificate) in which case the aggregate amount of such cost savings and cost synergies shall be as set out in such report.

(B) if and to the extent necessary to comply with mandatory provisions of the Swedish Companies Act relating to dividend distributions to minority shareholders, provided that, the Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, in such case shall ensure that any such dividends shall be paid at the lowest level allowed by applicable law;
(ii) such distribution consists of a group contribution, provided that no cash or other funds are transferred from the Parent as a result thereof (i.e. the group contributions are merely accounting measures), however so that group contributions made for tax netting purposes may be made by way of cash contributions, and provided that such distribution, net of the tax effect, is subsequently converted into or re injected as a shareholder's contribution to the Issuer as soon as practicably possible; or

A decision is made that any Group Company shall be demerged or merged if such merger or demerger is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, provided that a merger subject to existing security between Subsidiaries only or between the Issuer and a Subsidiary, where the Issuer is the surviving entity, shall not be an Event of Default and a merger involving the Issuer, where the Issuer is not the surviving entity, shall always be considered an Event of Default and provided that the Issuer may not be demerged.
16.7 Creditors' Process

(e) If the right to accelerate the PIK Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the period of appeal has expired in order for cause of acceleration to be deemed to exist.

(o) Information about decisions taken at a PIK Bondholders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure shall promptly be sent by notice to the PIK Bondholders and published on the websites of the Issuer and the PIK Agent, provided that a failure to do so shall not invalidate any decision made or voting result achieved.

(i) following a transfer of any PIK Bonds from the Original PIK Bondholder to any other Person, in the opinion of the PIK Agent and/or as confirmed by a reputable external expert engaged by the PIK Agent (if the PIK Agent reasonably considers it necessary to engage such expert), such amendment or waiver is not detrimental to the interest of the PIK Bondholders as a group;
