Total Loss Prepayment:

Upon a Total Loss Event, the Issuer shall promptly once insurance proceeds are available, but in any event no later than sixty (60) days following the Total Loss Event redeem (a) 100% of the outstanding Bonds at 100% of par value (plus accrued interest on the redeemed amount) if related to all Rigs or (b) if related to 1 or more Rigs, 30% of the outstanding Bonds for each Rig.

If the Bonds are redeemed according to this Total Loss Prepayment provision, the relevant amount on the Escrow Account, the relevant Rig Owner Earnings Account and the Issuer Debt Service Account or any of the insurance proceeds may be used as part payment in relation to the Total Loss Prepayment.
Mandatory Prepayment Means, except if it constitutes a Total Loss Event: Event:
(i) any of the Rigs are sold or disposed of;

(ii) the Parent ceases to be the owner (directly or indirectly) of 100% of the shares in each of the Issuer, the Rig Owners or any Charterer;

(iii) the Issuer's ownership of any of the Rig Owners changes;

(iv) the Rig 4 Construction Contract is terminated or sold or disposed of; or

Event of Default:

(v) expropriation or hijack of a Rig (to the extent not a Total Loss Event and in the case of a hijack, provided always that such hijack event shall have continued for a period of more than 90 calendar days).
The Bond Agreement and the other Finance Documents shall include standard remedy and event of default provisions, including remedy periods and cross default provisions against the Parent or the Charterer with an aggregate threshold of USD 5 million or against the Issuer or the Rig Owners with an aggregate threshold of USD 1 million.

The Finance Documents will contain waterfall provisions in case of partial payments, i.e. first to cover costs, fees and expenses of the Trustee (the "Trustee Expenses") and thereafter any other outstanding amounts under the Finance Documents. In case the Issuer does not pay the Trustee for incurred fees, then the Trustee may seek funding of the Trustee Expenses from the Bondholders, or failing them, other sources, in which case such other sources will be subrogated into the position of the Trustee, but subordinate to any further Trustee Expenses.
