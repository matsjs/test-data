(i) for a period of 180 days (from the date the Senior Mortgagee has received written notice of such event of default from the Junior Mortgagee) or such longer period during which the Senior Mortgagee is diligently pursuing an enforcement action with respect to all or material portion of the relevant security, unless the Senior Mortgagee has given its prior written consent thereto (on behalf of the lender and the bank guarantors of the USD 410M Facility); or

13
92

(ii) unless such enforcement is initiated after the Junior Mortgagee has paid to the Senior Mortgagee the amounts required pursuant to Clause 5e) (i) hereof against an assignment and transfer of the (1) Senior Security Documents and, (2) any other security document issued or granted as security for the USD 410M Facility, to and at the expense of the Junior Mortgagee;

d)

subject to Clause 5 above, the Senior Mortgagee may enforce or make any claims or exercise

any rights granted to it by the Borrowers and/or Polarcus and/or any other entity (as the case

have at law, or otherwise against the Borrowers, Polarcus and/or the Vessels and/or any

other entity under the Senior Security Documents, or any part thereof, without consent of the

Junior Mortgagee;

e)

subject to Clause 5 above, in the event that the Senior Mortgagee in the exercise of its rights

pursuant to the Amended and Restated USD 41OM Facility Agreement, and/or the Senior

Security Documents shall sell any of the Vessels or the shares in the Borrowers (as the case

may be), the Junior Mortgagee shall take all such steps as may be deemed necessary to

consent to and ratify such sale and, whether or not the proceeds of such sale will be

sufficient to discharge the whole of the Junior Indebtedness, the Junior Mortgagee shall co

operate fully and in good faith with the Senior Mortgagee for the purpose of effecting such

sale and, in particular, but without limitation, the Junior Mortgagee shall forthwith upon each

request of the Senior Mortgagee execute such discharges and/or reassignments as may be

necessary to complete the sale of any of the Vessels and/or the shares in the Borrowers, as

the case may be, free of any mortgage, charge, assignment or other encumbrances created by

or pursuant to the Junior Security Documents;

f)

the Junior Mortgagee shall not endorse, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer its rights or

obligations under any of the Junior Security Documents without first having procured that on

Mortgagee to be bound by and comply with and perform all of the obligations of the Junior

Mortgagee hereunder;

g)

Documents or any transactions related thereto or contemplated thereby with the Borrowers,

Polarcus UK, Polarcus 6, Polarcus Shipholding, Polarcus and/or any other entity whereby the

Senior Security Documents are or will be prejudiced and, without prejudice to the generality

of the foregoing, the Junior Mortgagee will not serve, or permit to be served, any notice of

assignment or registration with any registry or government contained in any of the Junior

Security Documents unless the form of such notice states that such assignment is subject to

and subordinate to the prior assignments contained in the Senior Security Documents;

14
93

h)

at the same time as giving any formal notice to Polarcus Alima that an event of default has

occurred under the Amended and Restated Bond Loan Agreement, notify the Senior

Mortgagee and DVB Bank in writing thereof;

i)

in the event that (i) the Senior Mortgagee declares an event of default under the USD 41OM

Facility Agreement and following receipt by the Junior Mortgagee of notice from the Senior

Mortgagee pursuant to Clause 5 c) and/or (ii) the Junior Mortgagee is aware of an event of

default under the Amended and Restated USD 410M Facility Agreement and/or the

Amended and Restated Bond Loan Agreement but prior to the Senior Mortgagee having

notified the Junior Mortgagee thereof in accordance with item (i) above (as the case may be),

it will not accept any payment under the Junior Security Documents, but if any monies are

received thereafter by the Junior Mortgagee under the Junior Security Documents, such

and 6 d) have been irrevocably paid in full. Payments to the Junior Mortgagee not made

under the Junior Security Documents, may be accepted by the Junior Mortgagee; and

j)

the Junior Mortgagee shall, so long as the USD 41OM Facility remains undischarged, upon

the request of the Senior Mortgagee, give notice in a form as the Senior Mortgagee may so

require to any person to whom notice of assignment has been given pursuant to the Second

Assignments of Insurances, or the Second Assignments of Earnings, that the security over

the assigned property to which each such notice of assignment relates constituted by the First

Assignments of Insurances, First Assignments of Earnings take priority over the security

over such mortgaged property constituted by the Second Assignments of Insurances and the

Second Assignments of Earnings, and that any moneys payable in respect of such pledged

property which might otherwise have been payable to the Junior Mortgagee shall instead be

payable to the Senior Mortgagee.

PROVIDED however that nothing herein shall preclude the rights of the Junior Mortgagee to join or intervene in or otherwise support any proceedings arising from or relating to the arrest or detention of any of the Vessels (whether at the instance of the Senior Mortgagee or any other person) with a view to substantiating, preserving or protecting its interest in such Vessel(s), always as long as such action does not interfere with the rights of the Senior Mortgagee and is not inconsistent with its obligations contained in this Agreement and the Junior Mortgagee shall give prompt notice to the Senior Mortgagee of any action taken by it to join, intervene or otherwise support any proceedings. The Junior Mortgagee shall, if required by the Senior Mortgagee to do so, withdraw from such proceedings or otherwise do whatever may be necessary to ensure that the relevant Vessel is released from such arrest or detention if the Senior Mortgagee and any other interested party also withdraw from such proceedings or take the necessary action to release the relevant Vessel.

Without prejudice to this Clause 7, nothing herein shall preclude the rights of the Junior Mortgagee to demand any payment o f any money outstanding under the Amended and Restated Bond Loan Agreement and secured by the Junior Security Documents.
