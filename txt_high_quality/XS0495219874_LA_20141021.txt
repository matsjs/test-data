Description of notes
The issuance of the notes was authorized by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company passed on March 10, 2010. The Company issued the notes under the Indenture dated January 16, 2010, among itself, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited as trustee (the "Trustee"), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as Principal Paying Agent, and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as Registrar, Transfer and Luxembourg Paying Agent. The Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, although the issuance of notes in this offering will be limited to  200 million. We may issue an unlimited principal amount of additional notes having identical terms and conditions as the notes other than issue date, issue price and the first interest payment date (the "Additional Notes"). We will only be permitted to issue such Additional Notes if at the time of such issuance, we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. Any Additional Notes will be part of the same issue as the notes that we are currently offering and will vote on all matters with the holders of the notes.
This description of notes is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the notes and the Indenture. Refer to the Indenture for a complete description of the obligations of the Company and your rights.
You will find the definitions of capitalized terms used in this description under the heading "Certain definitions." For purposes of this description, references to "the Company", "we", "our" and "us" refer only to Stena AB (publ) and not to its subsidiaries. Any defined terms used in this description but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
General
The notes
The notes:
 are general unsecured, senior obligations of the Company;
 are limited to an aggregate principal amount of  200 million, subject to our ability to issue Additional Notes;
 mature on March 15, 2020;
 will be issued in minimum denominations of  50,000 and integral multiples of  1,000 in excess thereof;
 will be represented by one or more registered notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be represented by notes in definitive form; and
 rank equally in right of payment to any future senior Indebtedness of the Company.
Interest
Interest on the notes will compound semi-annually and:
 accrue at the rate of 7.875% per annum;
 accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the most recent interest payment date;
 be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15, commencing on September 15, 2010;
 be payable to the holders of record on the March 1 and September 1 immediately preceding the related interest payment dates; and
 be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
Payments on the notes; paying agent and registrar
We will pay principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes at the office or agency designated by the Company in London, England, except that we may, at our option, pay interest on the notes by check mailed to holders of the notes at their registered address as it appears in the Registrar's books. We have initially designated Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch to act as Principal Paying Agent and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as Luxembourg Paying Agent and Registrar for the notes. We may, however, change the Paying Agent or Registrar without prior notice to the holders of the notes, and the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar. If notes are issued in definitive form, and for so long as the notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Company will appoint a Person located in Luxembourg and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee as an additional paying agent for the
89

notes and the Company will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent or Registrar in a leading newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
We will pay principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, notes in global form registered in the name of or held by the Common Depositary or its nominee in immediately available funds to the Common Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered holder of such global note.
Claims against the Company for payment of principal, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes will become void unless presentment for payment is made (where so required under the Indenture) within, in the case of principal and Additional Amounts, if any, a period often years or, in the case of interest, a period of five years, in each case from the applicable original date of payment therefor.
Transfer and exchange
A holder may transfer or exchange notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents. No service charge will be imposed by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar for any registration of transfer or exchange of notes, but the Company may require a holder to pay a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other governmental taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Company is not required to transfer or exchange any note selected for redemption. Also, the Company is not required to transfer or exchange any note for a period of 15 days before a selection of notes to be redeemed.
The registered holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
Make-whole redemption
The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time at the option of the Company upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).
For purposes of this make-whole redemption, "Applicable Premium" means, with respect to any note on the applicable redemption date, the greater of:
(1) 1.0% of the then outstanding principal amount of such note and
(2) the excess (to the extent positive) of:
(a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the principal amount of such note plus (ii) all required interest payments due on such note to and including March 15, 2020 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest), computed using a discount rate equal to the Bund Rate as of such redemption date plus 50 basis points, over
(b) the then-outstanding principal amount of such note.
For purposes of this make-whole redemption, "Bund Rate" means the yield-to-maturity at the time of computation of direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bunds or Bundesanleihen) with a constant maturity (as officially compiled and published in the most recent financial statistics that have become publicly available at least two Business Days (but not more than five Business Days) prior to the redemption date (or, if such financial statistics are not so published or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Company in good faith)) most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to March 15, 2020; provided, however, that if the period from the redemption date to March 15, 2020 is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Federal Republic of Germany for which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany for which such yields are given, except that if the period from such redemption date to March 15, 2020 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.
Optional tax redemption
The notes may be redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole but not in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice given as provided in the Indenture, at any time at a redemption price equal to the
90

principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption if, as a result of any change in or amendment to the laws or any regulations or ruling promulgated thereunder of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or Additional Taxing Jurisdiction or any change in the official application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, or any change in the official application or interpretation of, or any execution of or amendment to, any treaty or treaties affecting taxation to which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or Additional Taxing Jurisdiction is a party (a "Change in Tax Law"), which becomes effective (i) in the case of any Change in Tax Law of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, on or after the date of the Indenture or (ii) in the case of any Change in Tax Law of any Additional Taxing Jurisdiction, on or after the date such jurisdiction becomes an Additional Taxing Jurisdiction, the Company is or would be required on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date to pay additional amounts with respect to the notes as described under "Payment of additional amounts," and the payment of such additional amounts cannot be avoided by the use of any reasonable measures available to the Company, provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company would be required to pay such additional amounts.
For tax purposes, the Company believes that it is not currently resident in any jurisdiction other than the Kingdom of Sweden.
The notes may also be redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole but not in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice given as provided in the Indenture at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption if the Person formed by a consolidation or amalgamation of the Company or into which the Company is merged or to which the Company conveys, transfers or leases its properties and assets substantially as an entirety, or that succeeds to all of the Company's rights and obligations under the notes and the Indenture pursuant to any scheme of arrangement or other transaction, is or would be required, as a consequence of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, conveyance, transfer, lease, scheme of arrangement or other transaction or as a consequence of a Change in Tax Law occurring after the date of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, conveyance, transfer, lease, scheme of arrangement or other transaction, to pay additional amounts (as described under "Payment of additional amounts" below) on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date in respect of any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed on any holder.
The Company will also pay, or make available for payment, to holders on the redemption date any additional amounts (as described under "Payment of additional amounts" below) resulting from the payment of such redemption price.
Priorto giving notice of an optional tax redemption, the Company will deliverto the Trustee (1) an Officer's Certificate stating that the Company is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Company so to redeem have occurred and (2) an Opinion of Counsel qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction to the effect that the Company has or will become obligated to pay such additional amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law, and that the Company cannot avoid such obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it.
The Revolving Credit Facilities restrict the ability of the Company to optionally redeem the notes (whether in the event of a Change in Tax Law or otherwise). See "Description of other indebtedness."
Payment of additional amounts
All payments made by or on behalf of the Company on the notes will be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature unless such withholding or deduction is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges of (1) the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) in which the Company is organized or otherwise considered resident for tax purposes or (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the notes is made, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a "Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction"), shall at any time be required by such jurisdiction (or any such political subdivision or taxing authority) in respect of any amounts to be paid by the Company under the notes, the Company will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by such holder of such note, after such deduction or withholding, shall be equal to the amount such holder would have received in respect of such payment in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, the Company shall not be required to make any payment of additional amounts for or on account of:
(i) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been imposed, deducted or withheld but for (a) the existence of any present or former connection between such
91

holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such holder, if such holder is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) other than by the mere ownership or holding of such note or enforcement of rights thereunder or the receipt of payments in respect thereof or (b) the presentation of a note (where presentation is required) for payment on a date more than 30 days after (x) the date on which such payment became due and payable or (y) the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to additional amounts had the note been presented during such 30 day period);
(ii) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge;
(iii) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge which is payable otherwise than by withholding from payment of (or in respect of) principal of, premium, if any, or any interest on, notes;
(iv) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the failure by the holder of the note to comply with a request of the Company (a) to provide information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the holder or (b) to make and deliver any declaration or other similar claim (other than a claim for refund of a tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge withheld by the Company) or satisfy any information, certification, identification or reporting requirements, which, in the case of (a) or (b), is required or imposed by a statue, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge;
(v) any withholding or deduction imposed on a payment to an individual and required to be made pursuant to the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council Meeting of 26-27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced to conform to, these Directives;
(vi) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge that could have been avoided by the presentation (where presentation is required) by or on behalf of a holder of the relevant note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union; or
(vii) any combination of items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) above;
nor shall additional amounts be paid with respect to any payment of the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any note to any holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or limited liability company or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership, limited liability company or beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to such additional amounts had it been the holder of such note.
At least 10 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the notes is due and payable (unless such obligation to pay additional amounts arises shortly before or after the 10th day prior to such date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Company will be obligated to pay additional amounts with respect to such payment, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating the fact that such additional amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such additional amounts to holders on the payment date. Each such Officers' Certificate shall be relied upon until receipt of a further Officers' Certificate addressing such matters.
The Indenture will further provide that, if the Company conducts business in any jurisdiction (an "Additional Taxing Jurisdiction") other than a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and, as a result, is required by the law of such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction to deduct or withhold any amount on account of taxes imposed by such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction from payments under the notes, as the case may be, which would not have been required to be so deducted or withheld but for the conduct of business in such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction, the additional amounts provision (including exclusions from the obligation to pay additional amounts) described above shall be considered to apply to such holders as if references in such provision to taxes included taxes imposed by way of deduction or withholding by any such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority therein).
92

Wherever in the Indenture, the notes or this description of the notes there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal,
(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of notes,
(3) interest, or
(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to the notes,
such reference shall be deemed to include payment of additional amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, additional amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Company is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.
Under Swedish law as applied and interpreted on the date of this Offering Memorandum and as more fully described in "Certain tax considerations--Swedish taxation":
(i) the Company generally is not required to pay withholding tax in respect of the notes held by non residents of Sweden;
(ii) non-resident holders of notes generally will not be subject to estate duty or inheritance tax in respect of the notes in Sweden; and
(iii) a non-resident holder of notes who sells the notes generally will not be subject to Swedish capital gains tax.
Ranking
The notes will be general unsecured obligations of the Company that rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes. The notes will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future liabilities of the Company that are not so subordinated and will be effectively subordinated to all of our secured Indebtedness and liabilities of our Subsidiaries.
Change of control
If a Change of Control occurs, each holder will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to  50,000 or an integral multiple of  1,000 in excess thereof) of such holder's notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 % of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (the "Change of Control Payment").
Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice (the "Change of Control Offer") to each holder, with a copy to the Trustee, stating:
(1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such holder has the right to require the Company to purchase such holder's notes at a purchase price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment;
(2) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the "Change of Control Payment Date"); and
(3) the procedures determined by the Company, consistent with the Indenture, that a holder must follow in order to have its notes repurchased.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
(1) accept for payment all notes or portions of notes (in minimum denominations of  50,000 or integral multiples of  1,000 in excess thereof) properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all notes or portions of notes so tendered; and
(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the notes so accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of notes or portions of notes being purchased by the Company.
93

The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each holder of notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new note will be in a minimum principal amount of  50,000 or an integral multiple  1,000 in excess thereof.
If the Change of Control Payment Date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the Person in whose name a note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to holders who tender pursuant to the Change of Control Offer.
The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.
The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.
The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of any applicable securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.
The Company's ability to repurchase notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of the events that constitute a Change of Control also would likely trigger the obligation to repay all amounts outstanding under the Company's existing revolving credit facility. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under that revolving credit facility and trigger repayment of the revolving credit facility would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repaid upon the occurrence of change of control events that may or may not correspond to the definition of Change of Control under the Indenture. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. Finally, the Company's ability to pay cash to the holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Company's then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.
Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of the Company's existing revolving credit facility do, and future Indebtedness may, limit the Company's ability to prepay notes before their scheduled maturity. Consequently, the Company may be unable to fulfill its repurchase obligations if holders of notes exercise their repurchase rights following a Change of Control, resulting in a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture may result in a cross-default under the revolving credit facility.
Certain covenants
Effectiveness of covenants
Following the first day:
(a) the notes have an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Ratings Agencies; and
(b) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture;
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the subheadings "--Limitation on indebtedness" and "--Merger and consolidation" (collectively, the "Suspended Covenants"). If at any time the notes' credit rating is downgraded from an Investment Grade Rating by any Rating Agency, then the Suspended Covenants will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended and be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Rating (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no
94

longer be in effect for such time that the notes maintain an Investment Grade Rating); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture or the notes with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring after the notes attain Investment Grade Rating and before any reinstatement of such Suspended Covenants as provided above, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to such reinstatement, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period.
Limitation on indebtedness
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness; provided, however, that the Company may Incur Indebtedness, and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness (other than Capital Markets Indebtedness that is not Permitted Capital Markets Indebtedness), if on the date thereof:
(1) the Consolidated Coverage Ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries is at least 2.00 to 1.00; and
(2) no Default or Event of Default will have occurred or be continuing or would occur as a consequence of Incurring the Indebtedness or transactions relating to such Incurrence.
The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:
(1) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (including, without limitation, Indebtedness incurred pursuant to guarantees made by Subsidiaries in respect of Credit Facilities) Incurred under this clause (1) pursuant to one or more Credit Facilities in an aggregate amount at any time outstanding up to U.S.$1.5 billion;
(2) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however,
(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such Indebtedness being owed to a Person other than the Company ora Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; and
(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company,
shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be.
(3) Indebtedness represented by the notes issued on the Issue Date;
(4) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred with respect to any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the first paragraph hereof, any Existing Indebtedness or any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred under clause (3), this clause (4), clause (5), and clause (7) hereof;
(5) Indebtedness of a Person Incurred and outstanding on the date on which such Person was acquired by, or merged into, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness Incurred (a) to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Company or (b) otherwise in connection with, or in contemplation of, such acquisition); provided, however, that at the time such Person is acquired by the Company, the Company would have been able to Incur 1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5);
(6) Indebtedness under any interest rate swap, foreign currency hedge, exchange or similar agreements to the extent entered into to hedge any other Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture or otherwise entered into in the ordinary course of business;
(7) Indebtedness (whether or not secured) Incurred to finance the replacement of a Vessel owned or leased under a Capitalized Lease Obligation by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company secured by a Lien of the type described under clause (4) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" upon a total loss, destruction, condemnation, confiscation, requisition, seizure, forfeiture or other taking of title to or use of such Vessel (provided that such loss, destruction, condemnation, confiscation, requisition,
95

seizure, forfeiture or other taking of title to or use of such Vessel was covered by insurance or resulted in the payment of compensation or similar payments to such Person) (collectively, a "Total Loss") in an aggregate amount up to the "Ready for Sea Cost" for such replacement Vessel less all compensation, damages and other payments (including insurance proceeds other than in respect of business interruption insurance, protection and indemnity insurance or other third-party liability insurance) received from any Person in connection with the Total Loss in excess of amounts actually used to repay Indebtedness secured by the Vessel subject to the Total Loss;
(8) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to a Guarantee of Indebtedness of the Company; provided that if such Indebtedness of the Company is Capital Markets Indebtedness, either (a) such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture evidencing its Guarantee of payments of the notes, on a ranking in right of payment at least equal to such Guarantee or (b) such Capital Markets Indebtedness is Permitted Capital Markets Indebtedness;
(9) Indebtedness Incurred in respect of workers' compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, performance, surety and similar bonds and completion guarantees provided by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business;
(10) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument (except in the case of daylight overdrafts) drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business, provided, however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five business days of Incurrence; and
(11) in addition to the items referred to in clauses (1) through (10) above, Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (11) and then outstanding, will not exceed  150 million at anytime outstanding.
For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:
(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, may classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of Incurrence in part as one such type of Indebtedness and in part as any one or more other type of Indebtedness and may later re-classify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this covenant and only be required to include the amount and type of such re-classified Indebtedness as the type of Indebtedness to which it is re-classified;
(2) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;
(3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit are Incurred pursuant to a Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph above and the letters of credit relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;
(4) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;
(5) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and
(6) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP.
Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness and the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (i) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (ii) the principal amount or liquidation preference thereof, together with any interest thereon that is more than 30 days past due, in the case of any other Indebtedness.
96

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this "--Limitation on indebtedness" covenant, the Company shall be in Default of this covenant).
For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of Subsidiaries), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, which Lien is securing any Capital Markets Indebtedness, unless contemporaneously with the Incurrence of such Lien effective provision is made to secure the Indebtedness due under the Indenture and the notes equally and ratably with the Indebtedness secured by such Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured.
Reports to holders
For so long as any notes are outstanding, the Company will provide to the Trustee the following reports:
(a) within 120 days after the end of the Company's fiscal year, annual reports, in a level of detail that is comparable in all material respects to that included in the Offering Memorandum, containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (i) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Company for the three most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (ii) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (iii) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; (iv) a description of material risk factors and material recent developments; (v) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (vi) capital expenditures; and (vii) depreciation and amortization;
(b) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company, quarterly financial statements of the Company containing the following information: (i) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter and year-to-date periods ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; and (iii) material recent developments and any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent annual report; and
(c) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries or any senior executive officer changes at the Company or change in auditors of the Company or any other material event that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event.
97

At anytime that any of the Company's Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and such Unrestricted Subsidiaries individually or in the aggregate would, if they were a Restricted Subsidiary, constitute a Significant Subsidiary, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by (a) and (b) above will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
All the financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP on a consistent basis for the periods presented. Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements or information for the Company or Subsidiaries of the Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the Offering Memorandum or any reconciliation of GAAP to United States or other generally accepted accounting principles.
Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Company will also post such report on the Company's website or otherwise provide substantially comparable public availability of such report.
So long as any of the notes remain "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 501 under the Securities Act and during any period during which the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Company will make available to any prospective purchaser of the notes or beneficial owner of notes in connection with any sale thereof the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act. The Company will also make any of the foregoing information available during normal business hours at the offices of the listing agent in Luxembourg if and so long as the notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require.
Merger and consolidation
The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to, any Person, or enter in any scheme of arrangement or other transaction pursuant to which a Holding Company succeeds to all or substantially all of the Company's assets and liabilities, unless:
(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person or such Holding Company, as the case may be, (the "Successor Company") will be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Kingdom of Sweden, any other member state of the European Union, or of the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the notes and the Indenture;
(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least  1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the "--Limitation on indebtedness" covenant; and
(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture.
For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, which properties and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.
The predecessor Company will be released from its obligations under the Indenture and the Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the Indenture, but, in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor Company will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the notes.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person.
98

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (3), (x) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Company and (y) the Company may merge with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Company in another jurisdiction to realize tax benefits; provided that, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that merges into the Company, the Company will not be required to comply with the preceding clause (4).
Events of default
Each of the following is an Event of Default:
(1) default in any payment of interest on any note when due, continued for 30 days;
(2) default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on any note when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;
(3) failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under "Certain covenants--Merger and consolidation;"
(4) failure by the Company to comply for 30 days after notice as provided below with any of its obligations under the covenants described under "Change of control" above or under the covenants described under "Certain covenants" above (in each case, other than (a) a failure to purchase notes which constitutes an Event of Default under clause (2) above, (b) a failure to comply with "Certain covenants--Merger and consolidation" which constitutes an Event of Default under clause (3) above or (c) a failure to comply with "Certain covenants--Reports to holders" which constitutes an Event of Default under clause (5) below);
(5) failure by the Company to comply for 60 days after notice as provided below with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;
(6) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company ora Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:
(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness ("payment default"); or
(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "cross acceleration provision");
and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to  30 million or more;
(7) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the "bankruptcy provisions"); or
(8) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of  30 million (net of any amounts that a reputable and creditworthy insurance company has acknowledged liability for in writing), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the date on which the right to appeal has expired (the "judgment default provision").
However, a default under clauses (4) and (5) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes notify the Company of the default and the Company does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (4) and (5) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (7) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable
99

immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the notes because an Event of Default described in clause (6) under "Events of default" has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the notes shall be automatically annulled if the default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (6) shall be remedied or cured by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness within 20 Business Days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the notes, have been cured or waived. If an Event of Default described in clause (7) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes may waive all past defaults (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium or interest) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to the notes and its consequences if (1) rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the notes unless:
(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
(2) holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3) such holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense;
(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
(5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.
Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture provides that in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.
The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is known to the Trustee, the Trustee must mail to each holder notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the holders. In addition, the Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that is continuing. The Company also is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events which would constitute certain continuing Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposing to take in respect thereof.
Amendments and waivers
Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture and the notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes then outstanding (including without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, notes) and, subject to certain
100

exceptions, any past Default or compliance with any provisions may be waived, either retrospectively or prospectively, with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, notes). However, without the consent of each holder of an outstanding note affected, no amendment, supplement or waiver may, among other things:
(1) reduce the amount of notes whose holders must consent to an amendment;
(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any note;
(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any note;
(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption or repurchase of any note or change the time at which any note may be redeemed or repurchased as described above under "Make-Whole Redemption," "Optional Tax Redemption" or "Change of control," whether through an amendment or waiver of provisions in the covenants, definitions or otherwise (except amendments to the definitions of "Change of control" and "Permitted Holder");
(5) make any note payable in money other than that stated in the note;
(6) impair the right of any holder to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on such holder's notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder's notes; or
(7) make any change in the amendment provisions which require each holder's consent or in the waiver provisions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder, the Company, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent and the Luxembourg Paying Agent may amend the Indenture and the notes to:
(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;
(2) provide for the assumption by a Successor Company of the obligations of the Company under the Indenture;
(3) provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes (provided that the uncertificated notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated notes are described in Section 163(f) (2) (B) of the Code);
(4) add Guarantees with respect to the notes;
(5) secure the notes;
(6) add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company;
(7) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder;
(8) provide for the appointment of a successor trustee; provided that the successor trustee is otherwise qualified and eligible to act as such under the terms of the Indenture; or
(9) conform the text of the Indenture or the notes to any provision of this "Description of notes" to the extent that such provision in this "Description of notes" is intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture or the notes.
The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or supplement. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or supplement. A consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver under the Indenture by any holder of notes given in connection with a tender of such holder's notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. After an amendment or supplement under the Indenture becomes effective, the Company is required to mail to the holders a notice briefly describing such amendment or supplement. However, the failure to give such notice to all the holders, or any defect in the notice will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment or supplement.
Defeasance
The Company at anytime may terminate all its obligations under the notes and the Indenture ("legal defeasance"), except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations to
101

register the transfer or exchange of the notes, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the notes.
The Company at any time may terminate its obligations described under "Change of control" and under the covenants described under "Certain covenants" (other than "Merger and consolidation"), the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default and cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to Significant Subsidiaries and the judgment default provision described under "Events of default" above and the limitations contained in clause (3) under "Certain covenants--Merger and consolidation" above ("covenant defeasance").
The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the notes. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (4), (5), (6), (7) (with respect only to Subsidiaries), or (8) under "Events of default" above or because of the failure of the Company to comply with clause (3) under "Certain covenants--Merger and consolidation" above.
In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the "defeasance trust") with the Trustee money or Government Obligations denominated in euro for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of (1) an Opinion of Counsel from the United States to the effect that holders of the notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred. In the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. Federal income tax law and (2) an Opinion of Counsel from Swedish Counsel stating that holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Swedish tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to Swedish taxes on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same time as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred.
No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and shareholders
No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder, as such, of the Company shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the notes, the Indenture for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the United States federal securities laws and it is the view of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that such a waiver is against public policy.
Concerning the trustee
Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is the Trustee under the Indenture.
Governing law
The Indenture provides that it and the notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

In the case of the Post-Delivery Financing of a Vessel or Vessels (or the financing of the acquisition of a Single-Purpose Vessel Owning Subsidiary) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the computation of Consolidated Cash Flow for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Coverage Ratio shall be increased by (x) the pro forma annual earnings (losses) for such period pursuant to any binding charter, lease or like arrangement which will be applicable to any such Vessel (including a Vessel owned by any such Single-Purpose Vessel-Owning Subsidiary) for at least one year after the date of delivery of such Vessel to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (y) with respect to any such Vessel not subject to such an arrangement, the earnings (losses) for such period of the most comparable Vessel of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined in the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company), or, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries do not have a comparable Vessel, based on industry average earnings for comparable Vessels (as determined in the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company) during such period. For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any calculation under this definition, the pro forma calculations will be determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company.
