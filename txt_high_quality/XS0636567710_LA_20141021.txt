DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES
Norske Skogindustrier ASA (the "Issuer") issued the Notes under an indenture dated June 10, 2011 (the "Indenture") between, among others, the Issuer and Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as the trustee (the "Trustee"), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. Securities Act"). Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this "Description of the Notes" to the Notes include the Notes and any Additional Notes (as defined herein) that are issued. The terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture will not incorporate or include any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
The following description does not restate the Indenture and the Notes in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture and the Notes for a more complete description. Copies of the Indenture and the form of Note are available as set forth below under ``--Additional Information".
You can find the definitions of terms used in this description under the subheading ``-- Certain Definitions". In this description, the term "Issuer" refers only to Norske Skogindustrier ASA, and not to any of its Subsidiaries.
The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under the Indenture.
Brief Description of the Notes
The Notes
The Notes:
 are general obligations of the Issuer;
 rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not subordinated to the Notes;
 rank senior in right of payment to any and all future obligations of the Issuer that are expressly subordinated to the Notes, if any;
 are effectively subordinated to the existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors that is secured by Liens on assets of the Issuer to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness; and
 are be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer's Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, the Guarantees by such Subsidiaries of the obligations of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).
None of the Issuer's Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries, the Issuer's Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer. In June 2011, we finalized a corporate reorganization, and transferred substantially all of the Issuer's operating assets to newly incorporated companies that are wholly owned by the Issuer. Upon completion of these transfers, the Issuer became a holding company and does not conduct any operations. The Subsidiaries of the Issuer that hold the assets transferred in the corporate reorganization are not guarantors of the Notes, but certain of these subsidiaries will guarantee the Issuer's obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The Notes will therefore be structurally subordinated to all of the obligations of these and the Issuer's other subsidiaries.
Substantially all of the operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries and therefore the Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer's Subsidiaries. Any right of the Issuer to receive assets of any of its Subsidiaries upon that Subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) is effectively subordinated to the claims of that Subsidiary's creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer is itself recognized as a creditor of the Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the
114

Subsidiary that was senior to that held by the Issuer. As of March 31, 2011, the Issuer's Subsidiaries had NOK 469 million of bank loans and other borrowings.
As of the Issue Date all of the Issuer's Subsidiaries were "Restricted Subsidiaries'' for the purposes of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under the caption "--Certain Covenants--Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries", the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as "Unrestricted Subsidiaries''. Most of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture do not apply to Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
Principal, Maturity and Interest
The Issuer issued 150,000,000 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes in this Offering. The Issuer may issue additional Notes ("Additional Notes'') under the Indenture from time to time after this Offering. Any issuance of Additional Notes is subject to all of the covenants in the Indenture, including the covenant described below under the caption ``--Certain Covenants--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock". The Notes and any additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture. The Issuer issued Notes in denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2016 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 11.75% per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15, commencing on December 15, 2011. Interest on overdue principal and interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the Notes. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding June 1 and December 1.
Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes
The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a "Paying Agent'') for the Notes in the City of London (the "Principal Paying Agent''). The Issuer will ensure that it maintains a Paying Agent in a member state of the Pre-Expansion European Union that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union Directive 2003/48/EC (as amended from time to time) or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing, or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive. The initial Paying Agent is Citibank, N.A., London Branch in London.
The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a ``Registrar'') with offices in Luxembourg. The Issuer will also maintain a transfer agent in London. The initial Registrar is Citibank, N.A., London Branch. The initial transfer agent is Citibank, N.A., London Branch. The Registrar and the transfer agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein) outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of Definitive Registered Notes on the behalf of the Issuer.
The Issuer may change the Paying Agents, the Registrars or the transfer agents without prior notice to the holders. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Transfer and Exchange
Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ``144A Global Notes''), and Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in
115

registered form without interest coupons attached (the "Reg S Global Notes'' and together with the 144A Global Notes, the ``Global Notes'').
Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the "Book-Entry Interests'') will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under ``Transfer Restrictions''. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.
Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note, or the ``Restricted Book-Entry Interest'', may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note, as applicable, or the ``Reg S Book-Entry Interests'', only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.
Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of 100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the applicable Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under ``Notice to Investors''.
Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of 100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions and pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive Registered Notes:
(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;
(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;
(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or
(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.
Additional Amounts
All payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantors under or with respect to the Notes (whether or not in the form of Definitive Registered Notes) or any Note Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is
116

then incorporated or organized, engaged in business or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision thereof or therein or (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any subsequent Guarantor (including, without limitation, the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent) or any political subdivision thereof or therein (each of (1) and (2), a "Tax Jurisdiction") will at any time be required to be made from any payments under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the "Additional Amounts'') as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder of Notes after such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:
(1) any Taxes that would not have been imposed or levied but for the existence of any present or former connection between the holder or the beneficial owner of the Notes and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being a citizen, national or resident of such Tax Jurisdiction for tax purposes or having been engaged in a trade or business, being, or having been, physically present in or having had a permanent establishment in such Tax Jurisdiction), other than the acquisition or holding of such Note, the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note or the Indenture or under a Note Guarantee or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note or a Note Guarantee;
(2) any Taxes imposed or levied as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);
(3) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, personal property, transfer or similar Taxes;
(4) any Taxes withheld, deducted, imposed or levied on a payment to an individual that are required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive;
(5) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner of Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;
(6) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments made under, or with respect to, the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;
(7) any Taxes imposed, levied or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of Notes to comply with any written request of the Issuer (made at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request) to satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;
(8) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer or relevant Guarantor to the holder if such holder is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had such holder been the sole beneficial owner of such Note; or
(9) any combination of items (1) through (8) above.
117

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the holder of Notes for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise or property Taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties and interest related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction (or any jurisdiction if such Taxes are required to be paid in connection with the enforcement of the Notes, the Indenture or any other document referred to therein following the occurence of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes) on the execution, delivery, issuance, or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein, or the enforcement of any of the Notes.
If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, each of, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 day prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer's Certificate(s) must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. Upon request, copies of Tax receipts or other evidence of payments, as the case may be, will be made available by the Trustee to the Holders or beneficial owners of the Notes.
Whenever in the Indenture, the Notes, or in this "Description of the Notes'' there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment on the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.
Optional Redemption
At any time prior to June 15, 2014, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes (including Additional Notes) issued under the Indenture, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to 111.75% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption (subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date), with the net cash proceeds of an Equity Offering; provided that:
(1) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the Indenture (excluding Notes held by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and
(2) the redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.
At any time prior to June 15, 2016, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of
118

the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.
Except pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs and except pursuant to "--Redemption for Changes in Taxes", the Notes will not be redeemable at the Issuer's option prior to June 15, 2016.
Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.
Any redemption and notice may, in the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent.
Redemption for Changes in Taxes
The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in "--Selection and Notice"), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a "Tax Redemption Date'') and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, the Issuer or relevant Guarantor is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts (but, in the case of the relevant Guarantor, only if such amounts cannot be paid by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and the Issuer and/or the relevant Guarantors cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available (including, making payment through a Paying Agent located in another jurisdiction), and the requirement arises as a result of:
(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of this Luxembourg listing memorandum (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of this Luxembourg listing memorandum, such later date); or
(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official interpretation or application of such laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which amendment or change has not been publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of this Luxembourg listing memorandum (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of this Luxembourg listing memorandum, such later date).
In the case of Additional Amounts required to be paid as a result of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor conducting business other than in the place of its organization, such amendment or change must be announced and become effective on or after the date in which the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, begins to conduct business giving rise to the relevant withholding or deduction.
The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantees were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that there has been such amendment or change which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it.
119

The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.
The foreging provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.
For the avoidance of doubt, the implementation of European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive will not be a change or amendment for such purposes.
Mandatory Redemption
The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
Repurchase at the Option of Holders
Change of Control
If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of 1,000; provided that Notes of 100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of that holder's Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase (the ``Change of Control Payment''), subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice to each holder of the Notes at such holder's registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under ``--Selection and Notice", stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Notes on the date (the ``Change of Control Payment Date'') specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:
(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the Issuer.
The Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authentication agent approved by it) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.
120

The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.
The ability of the Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would give the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement the right to terminate their commitments and require that their loans be repaid. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. The future Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the ability of the Issuer to pay cash to the holders of the Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by its then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.
The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption ``--Optional Redemption", unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.
The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of "all or substantially all" of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all'', there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.
The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control.
If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Asset Sales
The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:
(1) the Issuer (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and
121

(2) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:
(a) any liabilities, as recorded on the balance sheet of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities), that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and as a result of which the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with respect to such liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities;
(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 90 days following the closing of the Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;
(c) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (2) or (4) of the next paragraph of this covenant;
(d) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale; and
(e) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is cancelled.
Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds (at the option of the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary):
(1) to purchase the Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of purchase (a "Notes Offer");
(2) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;
(3) to make a capital expenditure;
(4) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) not classified as current assets under IFRS that are used or useful in a Permitted Business;
(5) to repurchase, prepay, redeem or repay any Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary that is not Subordinated Indebtedness; provided, however, that in connection with any repayment, prepayment, redemption or purchase of Debt pursuant to this clause (5), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and if the Indebtedness repaid, prepaid, redeemed or purchased is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; or
(6) any combination of the foregoing.
Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.
Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant will constitute "Excess Proceeds." When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds 15.0 million, within ten Business Days thereof, the Issuer will make an offer (an "Asset Sale Offer") to all holders of Notes and may make an offer to all holders of other Indebtedness that ispari passu with the Notes to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price for the Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
122

the relevant interest payment date, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into (or to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds or if the aggregate amount of Notes tendered pursuant to a Notes Offer exceeds the amount of the Net Proceeds so applied, the Trustee will select the Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness, if applicable, to be purchased on a pro rata basis (or in the manner described under "--Selection and Notice"), based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.
The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, an Asset Sale Offer or a Notes Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control, Asset Sale or Notes Offer provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control, Asset Sale or Notes Offer provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
Selection and Notice
If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the Registrar, as appropriate, will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under "--Book-Entry, Delivery and Form", based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. The Trustee and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.
No Notes shall be redeemed in part if the resulting Note would have a minimum denomination that is less than 100,000. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.
For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Notes shall also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.
Certain Covenants
Suspension of Covenants when Notes Rated Investment Grade
If on any date following the Issue Date:
(1) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and
(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such date,
then, beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (such period, the "Suspension Period"), the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this Luxembourg listing memorandum will no longer be applicable to the Notes
123

and any related default provisions of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries:
(1) ``--Repurchase at the Option of Holders--Asset Sales";
(2) ``--Restricted Payments";
(3) ``--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock";
(4) ``--Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries";
(5) ``--Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries";
(6) ``--Transactions with Affiliates"; and
(7) clause (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under "--Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets".
Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to the actions of Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Period; provided that (1) with respect to the Restricted Payments made after any such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption "--Restricted Payments" had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period and (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (2) of the second paragraph of the caption "--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock". Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Period, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.
Restricted Payments
The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:
(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the Issuer's or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of the Issuer's or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests in their capacity as holders (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and other than dividends or distributions payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary);
(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Issuer) any Equity Interests of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent entity of the Issuer;
(3) make any principal payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is expressly contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or to any Note Guarantee (excluding any intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), except (i) a payment of principal at the Stated Maturity thereof or (ii) the purchase, repurchase or other acquisition of Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or scheduled maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of such purchase, repurchase or other acquisition; or
(4) make any Restricted Investment.
(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to as "Restricted Payments''), unless, at the time of any such Restricted Payment:
(a) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such Restricted Payment;
(b) the Issuer would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after givingpro forma effect thereto as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter
124

period, have been permitted to incur at least 1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption ``--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred S t o c k and
(c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue Date (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (2), (3), (5), (6), (7), (10) and (11) of the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum, without duplication, of:
(i) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period) from the beginning of the fiscal quarter commencing immediately following the Issue Date to the end of the Issuer's most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit); plus
(ii) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the Fair Market Value of marketable securities received by the Issuer since the Issue Date as a contribution to its common equity capital or from the issue or sale of Equity Interests of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock and other than net cash proceeds to the extent such net cash proceeds have been used to incur Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or preferred stock pursuant to clause (14) of the second paragraph of "--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock") or from the issue or sale of convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or convertible or exchangeable debt securities of the Issuer, in each case that have been converted into or exchanged for Equity Interests of the Issuer (other than Equity Interests (or Disqualified Stock or debt securities) sold to a Subsidiary of the Issuer); plus
(iii) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the Issue Date is (a) sold, disposed of or otherwise cancelled, liquidated or repaid, 100% of the aggregate amount received in cash and the Fair Market Value of the marketable securities received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or (b) made in an entity that subsequently becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Investment of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of the date such entity becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; plus
(iv) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Issuer designated as such after the Issue Date is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged or consolidated into the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or all of the assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary are transferred to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, the Fair Market Value of the property received by the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary or the Issuer's Restricted Investment in such Subsidiary as of the date of such redesignation, merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, to the extent such investments reduced the restricted payments capacity under this clause (c) and were not previously repaid or otherwise reduced; plus
(v) 100% of any dividends or distributions received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent that such dividends or distributions were not otherwise included in the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for such period; plus
(vi) upon the full and unconditional release of a Restricted Investment constituting a Guarantee made by the Issuer or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person (other than the Issuer or another Related Subsidiary of the Issuer), an amount equal to the amount of such Guarantee to the extent such amount is not otherwise included in the preceding clause (iii) or (iv).
The preceding provisions will not prohibit:
(1) the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any redemption within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend or giving of the redemption notice, as the case may be, if at the date of declaration or notice, the dividend or redemption payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture;
(2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of or with the net cash proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale or issuance (other than to a Subsidiary of the Issuer) of, Equity Interests of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock) or from the substantially concurrent
125

contribution of common equity capital to the Issuer; provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that are utilized for any such Restricted Payment will be excluded from clause (c)(ii) of the preceding paragraph and will not be considered to be net cash proceeds from an Equity Offering for purposes of the ``Optional Redemption" provisions of the Indenture;
(3) the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness of the Issuer, or any Restricted Subsidiary that is contractually subordinated to the Notes or to any Note Guarantee with the net cash proceeds from an incurrence of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness;
(4) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Equity Interests of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary held by any current or former officer, director, employee or consultant of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to any equity subscription agreement, stock option agreement, restricted stock grant, shareholders' agreement or similar agreement; provided that the aggregate price paid for all such repurchased, redeemed, acquired or retired Equity Interests may not exceed 3.0 million in any calendar year (with unused amounts in any calendar year being carried over to succeeding calendar years); and provided, further, that such amount in any calendar year may be increased by an amount not to exceed the cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary during such calendar year, in each case to members of management, directors or consultants of the Issuer, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any of its direct or indirect parent companies to the extent the cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests have not otherwise been applied to the making of Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (c)(ii) of the preceding paragraph or clause (2) of this paragraph;
(5) the repurchase of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon the exercise of stock options to the extent such Equity Interests represent a portion of the exercise price of those stock options;
(6) the declaration and payment of regularly scheduled or accrued dividends to holders of any class or series of Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or any preferred stock of any Restricted Subsidiary issued on or after the Issue Date in accordance with the covenant described below under the caption ``--Incurrence o f Indebtedness and Issuance o f Preferred Stock";
(7) payments of cash, dividends, distributions, advances or other Restricted Payments by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to allow the payment of cash in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares upon (x) the exercise of options or warrants or (y) the conversion or exchange of Capital Stock of any such Person or any of its direct or indirect parent companies;
(8) [Reserved];

(10) the payment of any dividend (or, in the case of any partnership or limited liability company, any similar distribution) by a Restricted Subsidiary to the holders of its Equity Interests (other than the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) then entitled to participate in such dividends on no more than a pro rata basis;
(11) the payment of any Securitization Fees and purchases of Securitization Assets and related assets pursuant to a Securitization Repurchase Obligation in connection with a Qualified Securitization Financing;
(12) [Reserved];
126

(13) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or to any Note Guarantee upon a Change of Control to the extent required by the agreements governing such Indebtedness at a purchase price not greater than 101% of the principal amount of such Indebtedness, but only if the Issuer shall have complied with its obligations under the covenants described under ``Repurchase at the option of Holders-- Change of control" and the Issuer repurchased all Notes tendered pursuant to the offer required by such covenants prior to offering to purchase, purchasing or repaying such Indebtedness; or
(14) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, other Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 25.0 million since the Issue Date.
The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. Unsecured Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be subordinate or junior to secured Indebtedness by virtue of its nature as unsecured Indebtedness.
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock
The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the Issuer will not and will not permit the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to, issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however, that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock and the Restricted Subsidiaries may issue preferred stock, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or such preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or the preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors may not incur Indebtedness pursuant to this paragraph if, after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or issuance (including pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors incurred or issued pursuant to this paragraph would exceed 50% of the Issuer's and the Restricted Subsidiaries' Indebtedness determined on a consolidated basis.
The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, "Permitted Debt''):
(1) the incurrence by the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness under Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) not to exceed 175.0 million, plus in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing, less the aggregate amount of all Net Proceeds of Asset Sales applied by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue Date to repay any Indebtedness under Credit Facilities and effect a corresponding commitment reduction thereunder pursuant to the covenant described above under the caption "--Repurchase at the Option of the Holders--Asset Sales";
(2) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue Date after giving effect to the use of proceeds of the Notes;
(3) the incurrence by the Issuer of Indebtedness represented by the Notes issued on the Issue Date and any future Note Guarantees;
(4) Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or preferred stock of any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, representing Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase money obligations incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price, lease expense, rental payments or cost of design, construction, installation or
127

improvement of property, plant or equipment or other assets (including Capital Stock) used in the business of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in an aggregate principal amount, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and preferred stock incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and preferred stock incurred pursuant to this clause (4), not to exceed 10.0 million at any time outstanding;
(5) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness or preferred stock of any Restricted Subsidiary in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge, any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and preferred stock (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was permitted by the Indenture to be incurred by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, under the first paragraph of this covenant or clauses (2), (3), (5) or (14) of this paragraph;
(6) the incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that:
(a) such Indebtedness must be unsecured and ((i) except in respect of the intercompany current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection with the cash management operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) only to the extent legally permitted (the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures required in the reasonable judgment of directors of officers of the obligee or obligor to protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the subordination of such Indebtedness)) expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations then due with respect to the Notes; and
(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (6);
(7) the issuance by any Restricted Subsidiary to the Issuer or to any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of preferred stock; provided that:
(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such preferred stock being held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; and
(b) any sale or other transfer of any such preferred stock to a Person that is not either the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary,
will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an issuance of such preferred stock by such Restricted Subsidiary that was not permitted by this clause (7);
(8) the incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Hedging Obligations in the ordinary course of business and not for speculative purposes;
(9) the Guarantee by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to the extent that the guaranteed Indebtedness was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this covenant; provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes or a Note Guarantee, then the Guarantee must be subordinated or pari passu, as applicable, to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed;
(10) the incurrence by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness in respect of workers' compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, captive insurance companies, bankers' acceptances, performance and surety bonds in the ordinary course of business;
(11) the incurrence by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently drawn against insufficient funds, so long as such Indebtedness is covered within 30 Business Days;
128

(12) Indebtedness represented by Guarantees of any Management Advances;
(13) Indebtedness incurred in any Qualified Securitization Financing;
(14) Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Issuer and Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate outstanding principal amount or liquidation preference which, when taken together with any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount and liquidation preference of all other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and preferred stock incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, will not exceed 50% of the net cash proceeds received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or from the net cash proceeds of cash contributions made to the common equity capital of the Issuer, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however, that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries have not made a Restricted Payment under clause (c)(ii) of the first paragraph or under the second paragraph of the covenant described under the caption "Restricted Payments" in reliance thereon;
(15) Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary providing for customary indemnification, obligations in respect of earnouts or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar obligations, in each case, incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business or assets or Person or any Equity Interests of a Subsidiary, provided that the maximum liability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the Fair Market Value of non-cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition;
(16) Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of (A) letters of credit, surety, performance or appeal bonds, performance or completion guarantees, judgment, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax guarantees or similar instruments issued in the ordinary course of business of such Person and not in connection with the borrowing of money, including letters of credit or similar instruments in respect of self-insurance and workers compensation obligations, and (B) any customary cash management, cash pooling or netting or setting off arrangements; provided, however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or other instrument, such obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing; and
(17) Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Issuer, Disqualified Stock of any Guarantor and Indebtedness or preferred stock of any Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding, including all Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and preferred stock incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and preferred stock incurred pursuant to this clause (17), not to exceed 50.0 million.
Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Note Guarantee on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment-ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities.
For purposes of determining compliance with this "Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (17) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, from time to time to reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant. Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt.
129

The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock or the requalification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness as of the Issue Date (including, without limitation, capital leases) due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred; provided, however, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated in non-euro currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement with respect to euro the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the euro-equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the euro-equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally incurred, except that to the extent that:
(1) such euro-equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in which case the Refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence; and
(2) the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the euro-equivalent of such excess will be determined on the date such refinancing Indebtedness is being incurred.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.
The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:
(1) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS;
(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and
(3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of:
(i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and
(ii) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.
Liens
The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien on any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of any other Person), whether owned on the date of the Indenture or thereafter acquired, securing any Indebtedness, except (a) Permitted Liens, or (b) if such Lien is not a Permitted Lien, to the extent that all payments due under the Indenture,the Notes and any Note Guarantees are secured on an equal and ratable pari passu basis with the obligations so secured (and if such obligations so secured are subordinated in right of payment to either the Notes or any Note Guarantee, on a senior priority basis) until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien.
Any such Lien thereby created in favor of the Notes or any such Note Guarantee pursuant to the preceding clause (b) will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the initial Lien to which it relates, (ii) in the case of any such Lien in favor of any such Note Guarantee, upon the termination and discharge of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (iii) any sale, exchange or transfer (other than a transfer constituting a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer that is governed by the provisions of the covenant described under "--Merger and Consolidation'' below) to any Person not an Affiliate of the Issuer of the
130

property or assets secured by such initial Lien, or of all of the Capital Stock held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in, or all or substantially all the assets of, any Restricted Subsidiary creating such initial Lien.
Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries
The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:
(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;
(2) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or
(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
provided that (x) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill period to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.
However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:
(1) agreements governing Indebtedness and Credit Facilities as in effect on the Issue Date and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the Issue Date;
(2) the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees;
(3) agreements governing other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described above under the caption ``--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the restrictions therein are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes than is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);
(4) applicable law, rule, regulation or order or the terms of any license, authorization, concession or permit;
(5) any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness or Capital Stock was incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred;
(6) customary non-assignment and similar provisions in contracts, leases, joint venture agreements and licenses entered into in the ordinary course of business;
(7) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business and Capital Lease Obligations that impose restrictions on the property purchased or leased of the nature described in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph;
(8) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock or all or substantially all of the property and assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;
131

(9) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;
(10) Liens permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described above under the caption ``--Liens" that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;
(11) provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements (including agreements entered into in connection with a Restricted Investment), which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements;
(12) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or suppliers or required by insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case, under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business;
(13) any encumbrance or restriction effected in connection with a Qualified Securitization Financing; and
(14) any encumbrance or restriction existing under any agreement that extends, renews, refinances or replaces the agreements containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing clauses (1) through (13), or in this clause (14); provided that the terms and conditions of any such encumbrances or restrictions are no more restrictive in any material respect than those under or pursuant to the agreement so extended, renewed, refinanced or replaced.
Merger, Consolidation or Sale o f Assets
The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving corporation), or (2) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:
(1) either: (a) the Issuer is the surviving corporation; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made is an entity organized or existing under the laws of Norway, any member state of the Pre-Expansion European Union, Switzerland, Canada, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;
(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made assumes all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture;
(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;
(4) the Issuer or the Person (as applicable) formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made would, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period be permitted to incur at least 1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption ``--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" or have a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio not less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and
(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel, in each case, stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture comply with this covenant.
This "Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets'' covenant will not apply to (a) any consolidation or merger of any Restricted Subsidiary into the Issuer, and (b) any consolidation or merger among Restricted Subsidiaries or (d) any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of assets among the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Clauses (3) and (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant will
132

not apply to any merger or consolidation of the Issuer with or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction, to change its domicile or to change its legal form.
Transactions with Affiliates
The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each, an ``Affiliate Transaction") involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of 2.5 million, unless:
(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and
(2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee:
(a) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of 7.5 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer set forth in an Officer's Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with this covenant and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer (or, in the event there is only one such disinterested member, by such disinterested member); and, in addition,
(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of 15.0 million, an opinion of an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of international standing, or other recognized independent expert of international standing with experience appraising the terms and conditions of the type of transaction or series of related transactions for which an opinion is required, stating that the transaction or series of related transactions is (i) fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate.
The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:
(1) any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement, consultant, employee benefit arrangements with any employee, consultant, officer or director of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, including under any stock option, stock appreciation rights, stock incentive or similar plans, entered into in the ordinary course of business;
(2) transactions between or among the Issuer and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries;
(3) transactions with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Issuer) that is an Affiliate of the Issuer solely because the Issuer owns, directly or through a Restricted Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person;
(4) payment of reasonable and customary fees, indemnification and similar arrangements (including the payment of directors' and officers' insurance premiums) and reimbursements of expenses and legal fees (pursuant to indemnity arrangements or otherwise) of Officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;
(5) any issuance of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer to Affiliates of the Issuer;
(6) any Investment (other than a Permitted Investment) or other Restricted Payment, in either case, that does not violate the provisions of the Indenture described above under the caption ``--Restricted Payments";
(7) any Permitted Investment described in clauses (4), (5), (6), (8), (10), (11) and (14) of the definition thereof;
(8) [Reserved];
133

(9) transactions pursuant to, or contemplated by any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and transactions pursuant to any amendment, modification or extension to such agreement, so long as such amendment, modification or extension, taken as a whole, is not-materially more disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes than the original agreement as in effect on the Issue Date;
(10) the entering into any agreement to pay and the payment of Management Advances and the payment of fees and expenses related to the offering as set forth under the caption "Use of Proceeds";
(11) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture that are fair to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person; and
(12) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing.
Payments for Consent
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture, to exclude holders of Notes in any jurisdiction where (i) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (ii) the payment of the consideration therefor would require the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a tender offer statement, registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of Norway or of the European Union or its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) (A) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction; or (B) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.
Lines of Business
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a Permitted Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Limitations on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness
The Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, Guarantee any Indebtedness of the Issuer that is Public Debt unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers to the trustee a supplemental indenture providing for a Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary on a joint and several basis with each other Guarantor (if any), which Note Guarantee shall be senior to or pari passu with such Subsidiary's Guarantee of such other Indebtedness, provided that (i) a Restricted Subsidiary's Note Guarantee may be limited in amount to the extent required by fraudulent conveyance, corporate benefit, financial assistance or other similar laws (but, in such a case (A) each of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will use their reasonable best efforts to overcome the relevant legal limit and will procure that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary undertakes all whitewash or similar procedures which are legally available to eliminate the relevant limit and (B) the relevant Note Guarantee shall be given on an equal and ratable basis with the guarantee of any other Indebtedness giving rise to the obligation to Guarantee the Notes) and (ii) for so long as it is not permissible under applicable law for a Restricted Subsidiary to become a Guarantor, such Restricted Subsidiary need not become a Guarantor (but, in such a case, each of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will use their reasonable best efforts
134

to overcome the relevant legal prohibition precluding the giving of the Note Guarantee and will procure that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary undertakes all whitewash or similar procedures which are legally available to eliminate the relevant limit, and shall give such Note Guarantee at such time (and to the extent) that it thereafter becomes permissible). Upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indentures, such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Note Guarantee created pursuant to the provisions described in the first paragraph of this covenant shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (a) (i) such Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary (including as a result of any sale, exchange or transfer (including by way of merger or consolidation), to any Person, of all of the Issuer's Capital Stock in such Restricted Subsidiary) or (ii) a sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary, in each case (i) and (ii) in compliance with the covenant described under "Repurchase at the Option of the Holders--Assets Sales" (including the requirements relating to the application of proceeds) and otherwise in compliance with the Indenture or (b) the release by the holders of the Indebtedness of the Issuer described in the second preceding paragraph of their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness) (but not under the relevant guarantee)), at a time when (i) no other Indebtedness of the Issuer that is Public Debt has been guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary; or (ii) the holders of all such other Indebtedness that is Public Debt which is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary also release their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness (but not under the relevant guarantee)) and, in each such case, such Restricted Subsidiary is not obligated in respect of any Indebtedness incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary under the provisions described in the last sentence of the first paragraph under the caption "--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock."
If and so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of the release of or the granting of such Note Guarantee in Luxembourg in the manner described below, at the offices of the Paying Agent or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such reports on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries
The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption ``--Restricted Payments" or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Issuer may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer's Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption "--Restricted Payments". If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption "--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock", the Issuer will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption ``--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock", calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the
135

applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
Maintenance of Listing
The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on another "recognised stock exchange'' as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom.
Reports
So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee:
(1) within 120 days after the end of each of the Issuer's fiscal years, annual reports containing the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer (or any predecessor entity) as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the three most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer (which need not comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Exchange Act), together with explanatory footnotes, for any acquisition or disposition of an entity or business or group of related entities or businesses that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates and that, individually or in the aggregate, have Consolidated EBITDA or consolidated assets that represent greater than 20% of the pre-acquisition Consolidated EBITDA or consolidated assets of the Issuer, in each case for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available (unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause 2 or 3 below (provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case, the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials)); and (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements with a level of detail that is substantially comparable to that in this Luxembourg listing memorandum, including a discussion of the results of operations (including a discussion by business segment), financial condition and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies;
(2) within 90 days following the end of the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2011 and within 60 days of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2012, quarterly reports containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the quarterly and year to date periods ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods for the Issuer (or any predecessor entity), together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer (which need not comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Exchange Act), together with explanatory footnotes, for any acquisition or disposition of an entity or business or group of related entities or businesses that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal quarter as to which such report relates and that, individually or in the aggregate, have Consolidated EBITDA or consolidated assets that represent greater than 20% of the pre-acquisition Consolidated EBITDA or consolidated assets of the Issuer, in each case for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available (unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause 2 or 3 below (provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case, the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials)); and (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements (including a discussion by business segment), including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer (or any
136

predecessor entity) and any material change between the current quarterly period and the corresponding period of the prior year; and
(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any changes of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or any senior vice president at the Issuer or change in auditors of the Issuer or any other material event that the Issuer announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event.
provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above will not be required to (i) contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or (ii) include separate financial statements for any Guarantors or non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Issuer.
In addition, if the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Subsidiaries are Significant Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.
All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS. Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements for the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Luxembourg listing memorandum.
In addition, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding, the Issuer has agreed that it will furnish to the holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.
Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Issuer will also (a) file a press release with the appropriate internationally recognized wire services in connection with such report and (b) post such report on the Issuer's website. The Issuer will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, at the offices of the Paying Agent.
Events of Default and Remedies
Each of the following is an "Event of Default'':
(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to the Notes;
(2) default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the principal of, or premium, if any, on, the Notes;
(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply with the provisions described under the captions ``-- Certain Covenants--Consolidation, Merger or Sale of Assets"; "--Repurchase at the Option of the Holders-- Change of Control" or "--Repurchase at the Option of the Holders--Asset Sales";
(4) failure by the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor for 60 days after written notice to the Issuer by the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class to comply with any of the agreements in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or Security Documents (other than a default in performance, or breach, or a covenant or agreement which is specifically dealt with in clauses (1), (2) or (3));
(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, if that default:
(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a ``Payment Default''); or
137

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity,
and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates 25.0 million or more;
(6) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, to pay final judgments entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of 25.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that an insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments shall not have been discharged or waived and there shall have been a period of 60 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of an appeal, waiver or otherwise, shall not have been in effect;
(7) except as permitted by the Indenture (including with respect to any limitations), any Note Guarantee of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or any group of its Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or the Issuer or any Guarantor which is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of its Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or any Person acting on behalf of any such Guarantor, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee; and
(8) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of its Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.
In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to the Issuer and any Guarantor, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all amounts in respect of the Notes to be due and payable immediately.
Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss, liability or expense. Except (subject to the provisions described under ``--Amendment, Supplement and Waived') to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:
(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
(2) holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3) such holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense;
(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
(5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.
138

The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding may, on behalf of the holders of all outstanding Notes, waive any past default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of premium, if any, any Additional Amounts or interest on any Note held by a non-consenting holder (which may only be waived with the consent of each holder of Notes affected).
The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture.
No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders
No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any of their shareholders or Affiliates, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under applicable securities laws.
Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
The Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officer's Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes and all obligations of any Guarantors discharged with respect to their Note Guarantees ("Legal Defeasance'') except for:
(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts) or premium, if any, on, such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;
(2) the Issuer's obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;
(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer's and the Guarantors' obligations in connection therewith; and
(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.
In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation to make Change of Control Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Indenture (``Covenant Defeasance'') and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all Events of Default described under ``--Events of Default and Remedies'' (except those relating to payments on the Notes or, solely with respect to the Issuer, bankruptcy or insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:
(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in euros, non-callable Euro Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euros and non-callable Euro Government Obligations, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts and premium, if any) on the outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a particular redemption date;
(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of United States counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as
139

a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of United States counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
(4) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer or others; and
(5) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel, subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.
Amendment, Supplement and Waiver
Except as provided otherwise in the succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes and any Note Guarantee may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes); provided that, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect one series of the Notes, only the consent of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required.
Unless (i) consented to by the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Notes or (ii) consented to by each holder of Notes adversely affected thereby (in each case including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), an amendment, supplement or waiver may not:
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described above under the caption "--Repurchase at the Option of Holders");
(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Note;
(4) impair the right of any holder of Notes to receive payment of principal of and interest on such holder's Notes on or after the due dates therefore or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder's Notes or any Guarantee in respect thereof;
(5) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or premium, if any, on, the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the Payment Default that resulted from such acceleration);
(6) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;
(7) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or premium, if any, on, the Notes;
(8) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by one of the covenants described above under the caption "--Repurchase at the Option of Holders");
140

(9) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from any of their obligations under their respective Note Guarantees or the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Identure;
(10) make any change to the ranking or priority of the Notes; or
(11) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.
Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer, any Guarantors and the Trustee (as applicable) may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes and any Note Guarantee:
(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;
(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code);
(3) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer's or a Guarantor's obligations to holders of Notes and Note Guarantees in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Issuer's or such Guarantor's assets, as applicable;
(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such holder in any material respect;
(5) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees to any provision of this Description of the Notes to the extent that such provision in this Description of the Notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees;
(6) to release any Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;
(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the Indenture as of the Issue Date; or
(8) to allow any Person to execute a Guarantee with respect to the Notes and/or a supplemental indenture in connection therewith.
The consent of the holders of Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.
In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an opinion of counsel and an Officer's Certificate.
Satisfaction and Discharge
The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder, when:
(1) either:
(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders, cash in euros, non-callable Euro Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euros and non-callable Euro Government Obligations, in amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal,
141

premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;
(2) the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and
(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be.
In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).
Judgment Currency
Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in euros which is made to or for the account of any holder or the Trustee in lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the "Judgment Currency''), whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the liquidation of the Issuer or any Guarantor, shall constitute a discharge of the Issuer or the Guarantor's obligation under the Indenture and the Notes or Note Guarantee, as the case may be, only to the extent of the amount of euros with such holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, could purchase in the London foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Judgment Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first Business Day following receipt of the payment in the Judgment Currency. If the amount of euros that could be so purchased is less than the amount of euros originally due to such holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall indemnify and hold harmless the holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, from and against all loss or damage arising out of, or as a result of, such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in the Indenture or the Notes, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any holder or the Trustee from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.
Concerning the Trustee
The Issuer shall deliver written notice to the Trustee within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default. If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the Indenture limits the right of the Trustee to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee.
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.
The Issuer and the Guarantors jointly and severally will indemnify the Trustee for certain claims, liabilities and expenses incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with its duties.
