Section B -- Issuer
Outokumpu Oyj.
Outokumpu Oyj is domiciled in Espoo, Finland. Outokumpu Oyj is a public limited liability company incorporated in Finland and organized under the laws of Finland.
Demand for stainless steel has been heavily influenced by general economic conditions in recent years. Although the global consumption of stainless steel products increased in 2015, the market continued to be adversely affected by the decline in the nickel price, concerns over the general economic conditions and the slowing economies, notably China. In recent years, stainless steel production capacity in Asia, particularly in China, has increased significantly and is expected to increase further. Asia has transitioned from being a net importer of European stainless steel to being a

B.5 Group

significant exporter of stainless steel to Europe. While the global trade flows within the industry have started to stabilize, problem of Asian overcapacity remains. Following the introduction of antidumping measures in the form of import duties in 2015 by the European Commission, the import levels in Europe have decreased and the measures have helped to keep base prices in Europe quite stable. Global stainless steel prices increased in 2014 mainly because of higher nickel prices, but in 2015 prices in Europe, the United States and China decreased below the levels seen in 2013 as a result of lower demand growth in transaction prices.
Outokumpu believes that the overall long-term prospects for stainless steel demand remain positive. Key global megatrends, such as, urbanization, modernization and increased mobility combined with growing global demand for energy, food and water are expected to promote the growth of stainless steel demand in the future.

Outokumpu Oyj is the parent company of Outokumpu. The following table sets forth the most significant operative subsidiaries that Outokumpu Oyj owned, directly or indirectly, as at the date of this Prospectus:

B.9 Profit forecasts In its stock exchange release dated April 27, 2016, Outokumpu published the and estimates following information on its business and financial outlook for the second quarter of 2016:
"Outokumpu expects that the stainless steel market conditions will continue to be challenging in the second quarter amid global economic uncertainties and subdued raw material prices. In Europe, the underlying demand in key sectors outside of Oil and Gas is expected to continue healthy but stock levels among distributors are still above historical averages. Market dynamics in Americas are showing some improvement: stock levels among distributors have come down, price increases have been announced and Chinese imports are being addressed with antidumping investigation.
Market uncertainties warrant prudence in the outlook statement for the second quarter. While steady progress in stainless business is expected, results will be burdened by weaker performance of the ferrochrome business driven by low ferrochrome price and USD/EUR exchange rate. Outokumpu expects its delivery volumes to be sequentially flat and the underlying EBIT to remain at a similar level as in the first quarter. With current prices, the net impact of raw materialrelated inventory and metal derivative gains/losses on profitability is expected to be marginal, if any.
Outokumpu is finalizing plans for the announced EUR 100 million reduction in its SG&A costs and estimates to book approximately EUR 40 million of redundancy provisions in the second quarter, out of which approximately EUR 5 million is expected to be cash effective during the quarter.
This outlook reflects the current scope of operations."

B.5 Konserni

Viime vuosina ruostumattoman teraksen tuotantokapasiteetti on kasvanut merkittavasti Aasiassa, erityisesti Kiinassa, ja sen odotetaan kasvavan edelleen. Aasian rooli on vaihtunut eurooppalaisen ruostumattoman teraksen nettotuojasta merkittavaksi ruostumattoman teraksen viejaksi Eurooppaan. Vaikka maailmanlaajuinen kaupankaynti ruostumattoman teraksen markkinoilla on alkanut tasaantua, Aasian tuotannon ylikapasiteettiongelmia on edelleen. Euroopan komission vuonna 2015 esittelemat polkumyynnin vastaiset toimenpiteet ovat laskeneet teraksen tuontimaaria Eurooppaan ja auttaneet pitamaan ruostumattoman teraksen hinnat Euroopassa kohtuullisen vakaina. Ruostumattoman teraksen maailmanlaajuiset hinnat nousivat vuonna 2014 paaasiassa korkeampien nikkelin hintojen ansiosta, mutta vuonna 2015 markkinahinnat laskivat Euroopassa, Yhdysvalloissa ja Kiinassa pysyen selvasti vuoden 2013 tasojen alapuolella seurauksena alhaisemmasta kauppahintojen noususta.
Outokumpu uskoo, etta ruostumattoman teraksen kysynnan yleiset nakymat pitkalla aikavalilla ovat edelleen myonteiset. Keskeisten maailmanlaajuisten kehitystrendien, kuten kaupungistumisen, modernisaation ja liikkuvuuden lisaantymisen yhdessa energian, elintarvikkeiden ja veden maailmanlaajuisen kysynnan kasvun kanssa odotetaan edistavan ruostumattoman teraksen kysynnan kasvua tulevaisuudessa.

B.9 Tulosennuste ja Outokumpu julkaisi 27.4.2016 päivätyssä pörssitiedotteessaan seuraavat tiedot

-arvio

liiketoiminnallisista ja taloudellisista näkymistään vuoden 2016 toisen

neljänneksen osalta:

"Outokumpu arvioi ruostumattoman teräksen markkinatilanteen jatkuvan haastavana toisella neljänneksellä maailmantaloudessa vallitsevan epävarmuuden ja matalien raaka-ainehintojen vuoksi. Euroopassa ruostumattoman teräksen loppukäyttäjäkysynnän odotetaan jatkuvan hyvänä öljy- ja kaasuteollisuutta lukuun ottamatta, mutta jakelijoiden varastotasot ovat yhä pitkän aj an keskiarvoja korkeammat. Amerikoissa markkinoiden dynamiikka on kehittymässä parempaan suuntaan: jakelijoiden varastotasot ovat laskeneet, hinnankorotuksista on ilmoitettu ja polkumyyntitulleista käynnistynyt tutkinta vaikuttaa Kiinan tuontiin.

Markkinoiden epävarmuudesta johtuen Outokumpu on toisen neljänneksen näkymissään varovainen. Ruostumattoman teräksen liiketoiminnan odotetaan kehittyvän vakaasti, mutta matala ferrokromin hinta sekä Yhdysvaltain dollarin ja euron välinen vaihtokurssi vaikuttavat negatiivisesti ferrokromiliiketoimintaan, mikä rasittaa tuloskehitystä toisella vuosineljänneksellä. Outokumpu odottaa toimitusmäärien ja oikaistun liiketuloksen olevan samalla tasolla kuin ensimmäisellä neljänneksellä. Raaka-aineisiin liittyvien varastovoittojen/tappioiden ja metallijohdannaisista johtuvien voittojen/tappioiden nettovaikutuksen odotetaan nykyisellä hintatasolla olevan korkeintaan vähäisiä.

Outokumpu viimeistelee aiemmin ilmoitettuja suunnitelmia myynnin, hallinnon ja tukitoimintojen kulujen vähentämiseksi 100 miljoonalla eurolla ja arvioi kirjaavansa toisen neljänneksen tulokseen noin 40 miljoonan euron irtisanomisvarauksen, jonka kassavaikutuksen neljänneksellä odotetaan olevan noin 5 miljoonaa euroa.

Liikkeeseenlaskuun ja sen kohteena oleviin Velkakirjoihin liittyy riskitekij öitä.

toimintaympä- Yhtiöön liikkeeseenlaskijana ja sen toimintaympäristöön ja liiketoimintaan

ristöön ja

liittyvät riskitekij ät on lueteltu jäljempänä. Tämä luettelo ei ole tyhjentävä, ja

liiketoimintaan myös riskit tai epävarmuustekijät, joista Yhtiö ei tällä hetkellä ole tietoinen tai

liittyvät riskit

joita se juuri nyt pitää epäolennaisina, saattavat vaikuttaa haitallisesti Yhtiön

liiketoimintaan, tulokseen ja taloudelliseen asemaan tai Yhtiöön tehtyyn

sijoitukseen.

Yhtiöön ja ruostumattoman teräksen teollisuuteen liittyvät riskit sisältävät seuraavat tekijät:

- Kova kilpailu on tyypillistä maailmanlaajuiselle ruostumattoman teräksen teollisuudelle ja epäreilut kauppakäytännöt voivat vaikuttaa haitallisesti ruostumattoman teräksen hintoihin ja vähentää Outokummun kannattavuutta samalla, kun ulkomaankaupan rajoitukset voivat rajoittaa Outokummun pääsyä uusille vientimarkkinoille.

- Ruostumattoman teräksen maailmanmarkkinoiden kapasiteetin kasvusta ja ylitarjonnasta aiheutunut alhainen kapasiteetin käyttöaste tai muut ruostumattoman teräksen kysyntään vaikuttavat tekijät ovat vaikuttaneet ja saattavat jatkossakin vaikuttaa olennaisen haitallisesti Outokummun liiketoimintaan, taloudelliseen asemaan ja liiketoiminnan tulokseen.

- Epäonnistuminen äskettäin julkaistuissa toimenpiteissä kilpailukyvyn ja tuloskehityksen parantamiseksi voi aiheuttaa Outokummun rahoitusjärjestelyjen eräännyttämiseen oikeuttavan sopimusrikkomuksen ja johtaa lopulta Outokummun maksukyvyttömyyteen tai selvitystilaan asettamiseen.

- Outokummun meneillään olevat uudelleenjärjestelyt Euroopassa eivät välttämättä toteudu nykyisten odotusten ja aikataulujen mukaisesti.

- Outokummun tuotannon ylösajo ja toimitusmäärien kasvattaminen eivät välttämättä onnistu Amerikan mantereella nykyisten odotusten mukaisesti.

- Merkittävä osa Outokummun rahoituksesta on vakuudellista, mikä voi vaikuttaa Outokummulle tulevaisuudessa tarjolla olevan rahoituksen saatavuuteen ja ehtoihin.

- Outokummun korkea velkaantumisaste voi rajoittaa sen toiminnallista joustavuutta.

- Raaka-aineiden ja tarveaineiden tarjonnan ja hintojen vaihtelulla tai Outokummun kykenemättömyydellä hankkia raaka-aineita ja tarveaineita voi olla olennaisen haitallinen vaikutus Outokummun liiketoimintaan, taloudelliseen asemaan ja liiketoiminnan tulokseen.

Velkakirjat eivät välttämättä sovellu sijoituskohteeksi kaikille sijoittajille.
Sijoittavat kantavat Liikkeeseenlaskijaa koskevan luottoriskin.
Velkakirjoille ja Liikkeeseenlaskijalle annetut luottoluokitukset eivät välttämättä ole tarkkoja ja luottoluokituksen nousu voi vähentää Velkakirjoihin liittyviä rajoituksia.
Velkakirjoille ei välttämättä muodostu aktiivisia jälkimarkkinoita.
Koska Velkakirjoille on asetettu kiinteä korko, markkinakorkojen muutoksilla voi olla haitallinen vaikutus Velkakirjojen arvoon.
Velkakirjoihin liittyvät lait ja käytännöt voivat muuttua.
Sijoitusten laillisuutta koskevat säädökset saattavat rajoittaa joitakin sijoituksia.

Risks Relating to Outokumpu and the Stainless Steel Industry
The global stainless steel industry is characterized by strong competition and unfair trade practices could adversely affect stainless steel p ric e s a n d reduce O u to k u m p u 's profitability, w h ile trade restrictions cou ld lim it O u toku m pu 's access to n ew export m arkets
In recent years, stainless steel production capacity in Asia, particularly in China, has grown significantly, and Asian producers have transitioned from being net importers of stainless steel to being significant exporters to Europe and North America. While the global trade flows within the industry have started to stabilize, the problem of Asian overcapacity remains and is being exacerbated by the slowdown in Chinese economic growth. Following the introduction of antidumping measures in the form of import duties in 2015 by the European Commission against cold rolled stainless steel products from China and Taiwan, the import levels in Europe have decreased, particularly from China. The antidumping measures will lapse in five years unless an expiry review is iniated. While these trade protective measures in Europe seem to be successful, imports from other regions have partly replaced the imports from China and Taiwan. Market shares of European producers have stabilized and the introduction of the antidumping measures has helped to keep base prices in Europe quite stable. However, anticipated more significant increases in base prices have failed to materialize as the strongly declining nickel price has curtailed demand, especially among distributors. The overcapacity situation in China combined with continued low price levels remain a risk to Outokumpu. Further, the expiry of certain provisions of China's WTO Accession Protocol in December 2016 may result in China being granted the Market Economy Status under the WTO agreement or other legislative changes, which may result in China demanding the review of or challenging the imposed antidumping measures, which may adversely impact the effectiveness of the aforementioned imposed measures.
Supply and demand is more balanced in the North, South and Central America, but the pressure to export Asian overcapacity to the NAFTA region has been increasing over the past years. On February 12, 2016, Outokumpu filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions in the United States together with other stainless steel producers. The stainless steel producers claim in the antidumping duty petitions that unfairly traded imports of stainless steel sheet and strip from China are causing material damage to the United States stainless steel industry, as Chinese producers are selling their products in the United States markets at prices less than their fair value, thereby significantly undercutting the United States market prices. The countervailing duty petition alleges that Chinese government has given significant subsidies to the Chinese stainless steel industry. Following the filing, US Deparment of Commerce and U.S. International Trade Commission have iniated their preliminary investigations. On March 25, 2016 the U.S. International Trade Commission made a unanimous preliminary determination that unfairly-traded imports of stainless steel sheet and strip are causing injury to U.S. producers. As a result of the Commission's affirmative determination, the U.S. Department of Commerce will continue to conduct its investigations on imports of these products, with its preliminary countervailing duty
38

determination due on or about July 11, 2016, and its preliminary antidumping duty determination due on or about July 21, 2016. The entire investigative process is expected to be completed latest in the first quarter of 2017. However, there can be no assurance that the antidumping duty petitions or the counterveiling duty petitions will result in duties being imposed to Chinese imports or, if such duties will be imposed, that they will adequately protect the producers of the United States from the increased imports into the United States.
Overcapacities have resulted in fierce competition in the stainless steel industry, which has led to a situation where many producers in various countries have called for government protection and trade protective measures to safeguard domestic industry. Outokumpu is exposed to the effects of "dumping" and other unfair trade and pricing practices by competitors. As described above Outokumpu itself has also been subject to orders imposing antidumping duties in the United States, which has made importing such products into the United States prohibitively expensive. Outokumpu may be exposed to these and other protectionist measures in any of the markets in which it operates. In addition, several countries, in particular those with centrally-controlled economies, grant substantial subsidies to companies active in their respective local stainless steel industries. The pricing advantage enjoyed by these producers on their subsidized products may impair or eliminate Outokumpu's ability to compete with such producers. This and other practices may have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's profitability to the extent heavily subsidized stainless steel products are exported into Outokumpu's key markets, the EU and the United States. Unfair trade practices or subsidies may also lead to increased supply in certain markets, resulting in increased price competition. In addition, Outokumpu has significant exposure to the effects of trade actions and barriers due to the global nature of their operations. Various countries (e.g., China, India and the United States) have implemented, and may in the future implement, trade actions and barriers, which could limit Outokumpu's further growth and market access and have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition and results of operations by limiting Outokumpu's access to these stainless steel markets and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Outokumpu may be adversely affected by, among other things, increases in competitors' production capacity; lower sales prices; increased imports entering Outokumpu's home markets and the development of new production technologies, products and customer offerings. If Outokumpu is unable to meet customer demands, or is unable to develop new and profitable products, it could lose market share and competitive position. As Outokumpu is unable to influence cyclical market trends and metal prices, its competitiveness and long-term profitability are, to a significant degree, dependent upon its ability to maximize capacity utilization and maintain low-cost and efficient production relative to its competitors and to build its position in less competitive, higher value-added markets, such as specialty stainless steel products or through product innovation. In addition, certain of Outokumpu's competitors have lower production cost positions and more extensive financial resources than Outokumpu, which may inhibit Outokumpu from competing effectively and result in the erosion of its market share. Any intensification of the competition Outokumpu faces could lead to a decline in sales and/or an increase in costs, which could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition and results of operations and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes. See "Industry and Market Overview."
L ow capacity utilization levels caused by increasing capacity and oversupply in the global stainless steel m arket or other factors affecting stainless steel dem and have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on O u toku m pu 's business, fin a n c ia l condition a n d results o f operations
The production of stainless steel is capital intensive and producers generally seek to maintain high capacity utilization rates to improve their profitability. Capacity utilization is primarily affected by the total available production capacity and stainless steel demand, with overcapacity arising when the total stainless steel production capacity exceeds stainless steel demand. In addition, overcapacity can arise if there is a long-term decrease in the demand for specific products. Although production can be shifted relatively quickly from one grade of stainless steel to another since the same melting and rolling equipment is used, specialization and the need to plan production in advance in order to optimize production runs can interfere with a producer's ability to adjust rapidly to changes in demand. Accordingly, stainless steel producers, including Outokumpu, may not be able to adjust and reallocate production capacity in response to changes in demand for a particular stainless steel product or grade.
Continued or increased capacity underutilization, whether due to increased production capacity, decreased demand or both, could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of
39

operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes. In addition, oversupply could adversely affect market prices.
Protracted low stainless steel prices and price volatility have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on O u toku m pu 's business, fin a n c ia l condition a n d results o f operations
Stainless steel prices are volatile, reflecting the cyclical nature of the global stainless steel market. Low stainless steel prices have an adverse effect on stainless steel producers due to lower revenues and margins as well as potential inventory write-downs (inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value ("NRV")). After picking up in 2014 largely on the back of higher nickel prices, stainless steel transaction prices in Europe, the United States and China decreased further in 2015 below the levels seen in 2013 as a result of lower demand growth transaction prices. Asian overcapacity has also resulted in Asian materials being imported into the European markets. Asian producers have certain cost advantages resulting from high investments in new stateof-the-art facilities with high production capacities, economies of scale and partially from cost advantages from using alternative raw materials, such as nickel pig iron and UG2, a by-product of the platinum production process used in South Africa that has a chromium content comparable to chromium ore and can be used to produce ferrochrome to a limited degree. Due to fluctuations in stainless steel prices, the expected selling price of stainless steel may at times deviate significantly from the original book value of material in inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and thus have an adverse effect on profitability. For additional information on Outokumpu's risks associated with raw materials prices, see "-- Volatility in the supply and prices of, or Outokumpu's inability to procure, raw materials and supplies could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition and results o f operations'"below.
Historically, significant price decreases during periods of economic weakness have not been balanced by commensurate price increases during periods of economic recovery. This has also been the case during the recent cycle. Accordingly, the timing and extent of the recovery and any potential return to previous price levels remains uncertain. A sustained price recovery will likely require a broad economic recovery in order to underpin an increase in real demand for stainless steel products by end users as well as continued reduction of production overcapacity. In addition to macroeconomic trends, stainless steel prices are sensitive to business cycles, particularly in the stainless steel end user industries. Protracted low stainless steel prices could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's revenues and profitability, including the effect of potential further inventory write-downs and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Failure to successfully im plem ent the recently announced measures to improve competitiveness andfinancial perform an ce cou ld resu lt in an even t o f defau lt under O u toku m pu 's fin a n c in g arrangem ents and, ultim ately, the insolvency or liquidation o f Outokumpu
In the beginning of April 2016, Outokumpu announced its new vision and measures to drive competitiveness and further improve the financial performance of the Company. The new vision has been defined as: to be the best value creator in stainless steel by 2020 through customer orientation and efficiency. Simultaneously, Outokumpu outlined its long-term financial targets connected to this vision. In the short term, Outokumpu's future development is expected to depend on the successful implementation of the measures to drive competiveness and the following short term actions:
· New organizational set-up meaning a simplified organization with three business areas, less management layers and a lighter cost structure;
· A reduction of EUR 100 million in sales, general and administrative costs (SG&A) by the end of 2017 against the baseline of EUR 400 million at the end of 2015; and
· A cash release of at least EUR 200 million from net working capital by the end of 2016, particularly through the reduction of inventory carry.
Outokumpu's current expectations regarding the impact and timing of the abovementioned measures are based on a number of assumptions and expectations that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. In the event that the measures are not sufficient or they materialize slower than is currently expected, Outokumpu may not be able to comply with the financial covenants based on gearing and liquidity levels and other conditions set forth in its
40

financing agreements in the medium term. If Outokumpu is unable to comply with conditions set forth in its financing agreements, this would result in an event of default, which could cause a significant proportion of Outokumpu's borrowings to become repayable on demand, unless waived by the lenders or refinanced. There can be no assurance that Outokumpu would be able to obtain a waiver of such conditions from lenders or to refinance the relevant borrowings on terms that are acceptable to it, or at all. A default would permit the creditors of such borrowings to accelerate their maturity and enforce the Transaction Security. This could result in forced sale of material subsidiary companies and business assets of Outokumpu, and could cause defaults under Outokumpu's other debt obligations, and as a result, ultimately result in the insolvency or the liquidation of Outokumpu.
The on goin g restru ctu rin g o f O u toku m pu 's operations in E u rope m a y n o t b e co m pleted in a m an n er an d within the tim efram e currently expected
Outokumpu is finalizing structural changes in its European operations aimed at improving financial performance and efficiency. See "Information about the Issuer - Investments, Divestments and Other Recent Events - Europe Restructuring". One of the main targets of the restructuring following the Inoxum Acquisition has been to improve capacity utilization in Europe through the concentration of melting activities in the Tornio and Avesta production facilities and the reduction of cold rolling capacity in Germany through the transfer of its cold rolling production in Benrath to Outokumpu's Krefeld production facility. Following the Bochum melt shop closure at the end of June 2015, melting has been transferred to Tornio and Avesta and cold rolling in Germany is concentrated in Krefeld and Dillenburg. The next milestones are intended to be the Benrath site closure in 2016 and the completion of the investment in ferritic stainless steel capacity in Krefeld by 2017. The European restructuring program is currenly progressing as planned with about EUR 35 million savings obtained by the end of the first quarter of 2016 and the full cumulative savings of EUR 100 million expected by the end of 2017. However, there can be no assurance that additional costs will not arise in connection with the restructuring in Europe or other synergy, cost saving or other efficiency measures, which could result in the provisions and total one-off cash cost estimates being insufficient and have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
In addition, following the restructuring in Europe, Outokumpu will increasingly rely on the Tornio and Avesta production facilities, particularly with respect to melting and hot rolling, and the facilities will be required to operate at higher capacity levels than before. Accordingly, any accidents or other stoppages or delays that affect production at Tornio or Avesta production facilities or the delivery of materials to cold rolling facilities could result in significant losses for Outokumpu. Such stoppages or delays may also result from the required utilization ramp-up at the Tornio or Avesta facility as the facilities have not been operated at contemplated utilization rates for longer periods of time. Any delays in customer deliveries during the restructuring could harm Outokumpu's reputation and, if repeated, could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's competitive position in Europe.
Outokumpu m ay n ot be able to ram p up its production and increase delivery volum es in the A m ericas as currently expected
Outokumpu has made progress in bringing its new integrated stainless steel mill in Calvert, Alabama, Unites States to full commercial capability over the coming years, with 2018 targeted to be the first year of steady-state operations. The technical ramp-up of the Calvert mill was completed at the end of 2014. All production steps have been tested and capabilities proven for both austenitic and ferritic grades as well as widths ranging from 36 to 72 inches. Production in both the melt shop and the cold-rolling lines is showing good quality, and operational performance was running largely according to plan throughout 2015. All the cold-rolling lines have been back in production since the beginning of 2015 following the earlier technical issues. Lower utilization rates following the weak order intake in the early part of the year have helped to reduce the late order backlog, and both delivery performance and yields are improving.
However, there can be no assurance that the ramp-up will reach the targeted production capacities as currently expected. Any major failure of equipment during the ramp-up could delay the ramp up significantly and result in additional costs that could be material. Similarly, any issues with the quality of different types of end products could delay the ramp-up. Even if Outokumpu is able to successfully ramp-up Calvert to the full commercial capacity, there can be no certainty that it will be able to increase delivery volumes and market share in the Americas as currently expected by Outokumpu. The new volumes entering the market may lead to price erosion
41

and weaker than anticipated demand for products produced at the Calvert production facility or additional capacity investments by competitors resulting in lower utilization of Calvert's production capacity than anticipated, any of which could have a material adverse effect on profitability. Outokumpu's ability to grow its business in the Americas could also be affected by slower than estimated growth in demand in the region. Accordingly, the expected return on the Calvert investment may be significantly lower than estimated by Outokumpu and any delays or problems in the technical or commercial ramp-up of the Calvert production facility would have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
A sign ifican t p o rtio n o f O u toku m pu 's fin a n c in g w ill m ature in 2 0 1 7 a n d 2019 a n d th ere can b e n o certainty that additionalfinancing will be available to Outokumpu before such tim e on commercially reasonable terms and costs, or at all
As at March 31, 2016, approximately EUR 848 million of Outokumpu's debt and a part of available credit facilities will mature within the next 12 months. In addition, significant amount of credit facilities, most of which are currently undrawn, will mature in February 2019. Outokumpu anticipates that it will maintain the presence in the commercial paper market, prepay and repay debt partially with e.g. anticipated disposal and capital market proceeds and refinance most of the long-term credit facilities before they mature. However, there can be no assurance that Outokumpu will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms and costs, or at all. In addition, adverse developments in the credit markets or other future adverse developments, such as further deterioration of the overall financial markets or worsening of general economic conditions or adverse developments in Outokumpu's operating results and factors that affect such results, could affect Outokumpu's ability to borrow additional funds as well as the cost and other terms of funding. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect Outokumpu's liquidity and working capital in the medium term. The failure to obtain sufficient funding for operations or the increased costs or unfavorable terms of the required additional financing could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
A sign ifican t p o rtio n o f O u toku m pu 's fin a n c in g is secured, which co u ld affect the availability a n d term s o f fin an cin g available to Outokumpu in the fu tu re
A significant portion of Outokumpu's indebtedness is secured by the Transaction Security. This is likely to limit Outokumpu's ability to obtain unsecured financing as long as any secured debt is outstanding. For example, Outokumpu has utilized commercial paper programs to manage its short-term liquidity needs and expects to continue to do so in the near to medium term; however, there can be no certainty that it will be able to continue to obtain such financing on the same or similar terms as in the past. Although the Intercreditor Agreement entered into in connection with the granting of the Transaction Security and the various financing arrangements do not prohibit Outokumpu from incurring secured indebtedness in the future, they do contain certain restrictions with respect to the types and/or amount of secured indebtedness that Outokumpu may incur in the future. Also, the terms and conditions of the convertible notes maturing in 2020 may have implications when incurring new secured capital market debt. The coupon of the convertible notes increases when incurring new secured capital market debt exceeding the principal amount of EUR 250 million and the convertible notes are required become secured if the amount of new secured capital market debt exceeds EUR 650 million. Any of the foregoing may limit Outokumpu's ability to raise additional financing on commercially acceptable terms or at all, and as a result, have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
O u toku m pu 's high level o f indebtedness cou ld lim it its o peration alfle x ib ility
While Outokumpu has significantly deleveraged its balance sheet over the past few years, the Company continues to have high level of indebtedness (as at March 31, 2016 net debt was EUR 1,551 million), which requires Outokumpu to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow to make payments on indebtedness. Outokumpu's high level of indebtedness also increases Outokumpu's vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and limits Outokumpu's flexibility to plan for or react to changes in the stainless steel market. This could place Outokumpu at a competitive disadvantage as compared to less leveraged competitors
42

and competitors that have more favorable access to capital resources. Outokumpu may also be required to accept less attractive terms from its suppliers due to its strained financial condition, which would increase its costs and have an adverse effect on its profitability. As described in "Industry and market overview - Stainless Steel Market', the stainless steel industry is affected by global economic conditions and the prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty continues to have a material adverse effect on demand for stainless steel.
As Outokumpu's sales are mainly derived from Europe, the continuation of any economic instability in the region could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
In addition, any deterioration of economic conditions in other regions in which Outokumpu has significant operations, such as in the United States and Mexico, or weakening of economic conditions in emerging economies that are substantial consumers of stainless steel (such as Brazil, India and China as well as certain other emerging countries), could result in a prolonged period of slower growth, which could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, any significant deterioration of economic condition in the Unites States and Mexico would have an impact on the commercial ramp-up of the Calvert integrated stainless steel production facility, which could delay or prevent the improvement in the profitability of the Americas business area currently expected by Outokumpu.
Furthermore, continued financial weakness of significant consumers of stainless steel products, such as those in the process industries, or the bankruptcy of any large company in such industries, would exacerbate the negative trend in market conditions. In addition, Outokumpu's products are used by end users in certain other important industries and as a result, Outokumpu is significantly affected by developments in these industries. For instance, stainless steel is used in the automotive, metals processing, construction, white goods and chemical, petrochemical and energy industries. Some of these end user industries, such as the automotive and construction industries, are highly cyclical and as a result, the demand for Outokumpu's products may vary significantly.
Outokumpu's high level of indebtedness could also lead to adverse changes in payment terms with suppliers. Furthermore, credit insurers may not be able to insure sufficient amount of Outokumpu risk for suppliers which again might lead to adverse changes in payment terms and therefore increased financing needs for Outokumpu.
Volatility in th e su pply a n d p ric e s of, or O u toku m pu 's inability to p ro cu re, ra w m aterials a n d supplies cou ld have a m aterial adverse effect on O u toku m pu 's business, fin a n c ia l condition a n d results o f operations
Stainless steel and ferrochrome production requires consumption of substantial amounts of raw materials (primarily nickel, recycled stainless steel, ferrochrome, chromite, molybdenum and recycled carbon steel) and other supplies. Most of these raw materials and supplies are subject to price volatility due to fluctuating demand, speculation and scarcity, which may, from time to time, be compounded by decreases in extraction and production due to natural disasters, political or financial instability or unrest.
Outokumpu is exposed to price volatility of raw materials and supplies, which it purchases primarily under shortor long-term contracts, but also on the spot market. Increases in the prices of certain raw materials, such as nickel, ferrochrome, molybdenum and iron, are generally passed on to customers through the alloy surcharge as discussed below. Outokumpu hedges most of its exposure to changing nickel prices and, partially, molybdenum prices. However, Outokumpu does not hedge its exposure to the price volatility of certain other raw materials, such as iron. There can be no assurance that any commodity hedging policies adopted by Outokumpu are or will be effective.
Outokumpu may not be able to pass on all of its raw material costs to customers. Prices for stainless steel products sold in Europe and the United States generally include two components:
· the "base price," which is negotiated with customers and depends mainly on market supply and demand; and
· the "alloy surcharge," which is added by producers in order to allow the costs of alloys, such as nickel, chromium, iron and molybdenum, to be directly passed on to customers when they exceed a predetermined amount.
43

Although the alloy surcharge is intended to allow stainless steel producers to pass on the costs of raw materials to customers, it does not eliminate Outokumpu's exposure to raw materials price volatility. The alloy surcharge generally applied in the industry provide that the surcharge for a given month is typically published at the end of the prior month and is typically based on alloy prices during the month prior to the publication of the alloy surcharge (the "Reference Period"). As the throughput times in stainless steel production are longer than the time period used to calculate the alloy surcharge, raw materials are often purchased before the Reference Period; therefore, Outokumpu may not be able to pass on all of its raw materials costs to customers if there is a decrease in raw materials prices between the date when the raw materials are purchased and the Reference Period. This could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's profitability. In addition, a significant part of the future prices for the products to be sold is estimated at each balance sheet date. Estimated NRVs of inventories may deviate significantly from the original book value of the inventories, which can result in inventory write-downs. A significant portion of Outokumpu's net working capital consist of value related to alloying metals in stainless steel; therefore, an increase in the metal prices would lead to higher amount of net working capital and increase funding requirements. Accordingly, fluctuations in raw materials prices could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Since January 1, 2014, Outokumpu has applied a daily alloy surcharge instead of the previous monthly model for certain customers in Europe. In this model, Outokumpu communicates the alloy surcharges on a daily basis for its customers on its website. Customers can decide whether to fix the alloy surcharge on the order date or on any other date between the order and mid-week prior to the delivery week. Outokumpu believes that the daily alloy surcharge system decreases its exposure to volatility in raw material prices because Outokumpu can more quickly reflect changes in raw material prices in the pricing of its products and it makes hedging of raw materials positions easier. However, the daily alloy surcharge does not eliminate Outokumpu's exposure to volatility in raw materials prices and certain customers may prefer the pricing model based on the Reference Period, which allows them to attempt to benefit from market price changes when timing their purchases, which may cause customers, distributors in particular, to use competitive producers. Accordingly, Outokumpu may not be able to derive all the anticipated benefits from the introduction of the daily alloy surcharge method.
In addition, Outokumpu may be unable to procure certain necessary raw materials on a timely basis, on acceptable price and other terms, or at all. For certain raw materials, such as recycled stainless steel, Outokumpu has relied on a small number of suppliers. Although there are alternative suppliers on the market for each of Outokumpu's raw materials, replacing a supplier may be time consuming and the terms available may not be as favorable as the terms in current supply agreements. In addition, some of Outokumpu's raw materials suppliers have significant pricing power. Further, Outokumpu may be forced to purchase products from other suppliers for various reasons, including, if a supply contract is not extended, if a supplier is not able to meet its delivery obligations (including due to export, import or other restrictions for certain raw materials), or if a supplier faces financial or operational difficulties or disruptions. For example, the ongoing or further similar sanctions against Russia could impact Outokumpu's ability to source certain raw materials or supplies from Russia. If Outokumpu is unable to obtain adequate and punctual deliveries of required raw materials or supplies at acceptable prices, it may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products in a timely manner (especially those products that require long lead times or which involve complex manufacturing processes), which could harm its reputation and cause it to lose customers, incur additional costs or delay new product introductions.
Any prolonged interruption in the supply of raw materials, or increases in raw materials costs that cannot be passed on to customers, could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
The sales volum es and p rices that Outokum pu is able to charge fo r its products could be affected by inaccurate sales planning or by the stocking and destocking o f stainless steelproducts by distributors
Outokumpu's customers include distributors and processors that stock and reprocess stainless steel to serve end users. Stainless steel distributors typically make purchasing decisions based on expectations regarding raw materials price trends and stainless steel demand. When raw material prices or demand for stainless steel products are expected to increase, distributors and processors tend to increase their purchases with the goal of reselling such products at a higher price in the future. When distributors reduce their inventories, generally in response to expected decreases in raw materials prices or stainless steel demand, it sets downward pressure on
44

the base price that stainless steel producers are able to charge for products. Conversely, during periods when distributors restock stainless steel inventories, base prices tend to increase to reflect the increase in demand. The purchasing decisions of distributors could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition and results of operations.
Sales planning in Outokumpu's business areas could be affected by over optimism or inaccuracy in forecasting, which may lead to oversized procurement of raw materials and production supplies. If sales forecasting is not accurate, the additional procurement of raw materials and supplies may increase inventories, incur additional costs and increase the net working capital and financing costs, which all, if materialized, could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
In addition, demand volatility makes it difficult for a stainless steel producer to optimize production capacity. For instance, during periods of destocking by distributors, stainless steel producers may decide to reduce production in an attempt to counter the decline in demand and base prices. However, such reductions in capacity utilization also decrease profitability; therefore, there can be no assurance that such reductions would mitigate the adverse effects of destocking by distributors. Increases in costs per unit and resulting declines in competitiveness as a result of demand volatility could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Outokumpu m ay n ot be able to purchase recycled stainless steel on favorable term s in the fu tu re, which could have a m aterial adverse effect on its profitability
Recycled stainless steel is an important raw material for Outokumpu, representing 74 percent of total raw material use by volume in 2015. Outokumpu has increased the use of recycled stainless steel in its production in recent years and, due to the scale of its operations and purchase volumes, has been able to purchase recycled stainless steel at a cost that has allowed it to better compete against Asian imports and obtain better margins for its products. Recently, stainless scrap discounts for alloy metals have been reducing due to tighter supply of scrap especially in Europe. There can be no certainty that Outokumpu will continue to have access to low cost recycled stainless steel in the future. The market for recycled stainless steel may change due to a number of factors, including lower availability i.e. lower scrap generation at lower nickel prices or Asian producers starting to use it as a raw material should the price of recycled stainless steel decrease to a level where it is comparable to nickel pig iron used by Asian producers or should the production costs of nickel pig iron rise significantly to a comparable level as of recycled stainless steel. Any significant change in access to or cost of recycled stainless steel would have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's profitability.

As global demand for stainless steel is forecasted to increase in the long term, Outokumpu expects that global demand for ferrochrome, a key raw material for stainless steel production, will increase accordingly. Outokumpu produces ferrochrome at its Tornio ferrochrome production facility using chromite extracted from its Kemi chromite mine. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Outokumpu produced 457,000 tonnes of ferrochrome, of which 72 percent was used by Outokumpu to produce stainless steel and 28 percent was sold on the global market.
Outokumpu aims to maintain a high utilization rate at its ferrochrome production facility by consuming a significant amount of ferrochrome internally and also by selling certain volumes on the global market. Global supplies of ferrochrome currently exceed demand, which has adversely affected ferrochrome prices and, therefore, Outokumpu's profit margin on global ferrochrome sales has decreased in recent years. There can be no assurance that the oversupply of ferrochrome in the market and resulting reduced ferrochrome prices will not continue or intensify in the future. In addition, there can be no assurance that Outokumpu's ferrochrome production capacity can be fully utilized or that the additional production can be sold to the global market due to fluctuations in ferrochrome prices and demand, or that supply will not continue to exceed demand in the global ferrochrome market, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial

condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
The stainless steel industry is characterized by significant capital expenditure in the expansion o f production and maintenance o f existing production facilities and there can be no assurance that the planned investments w ill be carried out, targets set f o r these investm ents w ill b e rea lized or th a t O u to k u m p u 's a ctu al capital expenditure w ill be within its targets
Outokumpu asset base is well invested and the Company's focus over the coming years will firmly remain to get returns on the recent investments. Therefore Outokumpu expects to keep capital expenditures at moderate levels and cash flow based capital expenditure in 2016 to be approximately EUR 140 million. Out of this EUR 70-80 million is mandatory and maintenance capital expenditure. Outokumpu's capital expenditure for continuing operations was EUR 154 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. There can be no certainty that Outokumpu will be able to maintain its capital expenditure at or below its target levels because of unanticipated expenditure increases or otherwise. Reduced levels of capital expenditure could also result in deterioration in the quality of Outokumpu's production operations, which could result in higher maintenance and replacement costs in the long-term. In addition, postponed capital expenditure could subject Outokumpu's production facilities to a higher risk of accidents and could result in Outokumpu losing its relative competitive advantage and reduce the value of the facilities. Therefore, long periods of reduced capital expenditure levels could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Outokumpu m ay not benefit from competitive prices fo r and reliable access to energy required fo r the production o f stainless steel products andferrochrom e
The production of stainless steel products and ferrochrome requires significant amounts of energy, particularly electricity and, to a lesser extent, propane, natural gas and light fuel oil. Energy costs represent a substantial portion of Outokumpu's total cost of sales and energy prices have historically varied, and may continue to vary significantly, as a result of political and economic factors beyond Outokumpu's control. For example, the European Climate and Energy Package (the "CEP") has a significant impact on the electricity markets in Europe, and, therefore, also affects Outokumpu's business. The CEP is a set of binding legislation, which aims to ensure that the EU meets its climate and energy targets for 2020, including, for example, a 20 percent improvement in the EU's energy efficiency through the Energy Efficiency Plan 2011 adopted by the European Commission and the Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 25, 2012 on energy efficiency. Outokumpu expects that energy prices will increase in Europe due to the CEP and related legislation.
A significant number of Outokumpu's production facilities are located in Germany, where electricity prices have historically been higher than in other countries in Northern Europe and Asia. As the German government has decided to phase out nuclear power generation by 2022, electricity prices and price volatility in Germany could increase further. This is partly due to the significant increase in intermittent electricity production, such as wind and solar power, which are currently supported by feed-in tariffs based on the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz). Increased production of intermittent renewable power may increase price volatility in the electricity wholesales markets and may affect the power flows in Germany and in neighboring countries. In addition, although Outokumpu currently benefits from special treatment for businesses with high electricity consumption under the German Renewable Energies Act, such treatment may be less favorable or discontinued in the future, which would further increase its electricity costs. See "--Outokumpu has benefited from certain public subsidies and advantages and there can be no assurance that such subsidies and advantages will be available to Outokumpu in the future" below. Also, Outokumpu's Calvert integrated production facility in Alabama, United States, is dependent on a local electricity provider that has significant pricing power. Unexpected changes in electricity supply policies in Germany or Alabama could adversely affect Outokumpu's profitability.
Outokumpu announced on December 19, 2014 that it will invest approximately EUR 30 million into using liquefied natural gas ("LNG") at Tornio mill instead of propane gas. The vast majority of the investment, phased over the years from 2015 to 2018, is used to carry out the required equipment modifications at the Tornio mill. The transfer to LNG is made possible by the construction of a LNG terminal at Tornio harbor, Northern Finland.
46

Manga LNG Oy, a joint venture of Outokumpu Group, SSAB, Skangass and EPV Energy Ltd, will build and operate the terminal, and procure LNG for its owners. Outokumpu's share of Manga LNG Oy is 45 percent. Outokumpu and its stainless steel mill in Tornio will be the main user of the natural gas imported through the terminal. There can be no assurance that Outokumpu will benefit from the transfer to use LNG instead of propane due the volatility of propane price and therefore it could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Disruptions in the supply of energy resources could also temporarily impair Outokumpu's production operations. Such disruptions may also occur as a result of the loss of energy supply contracts or the inability to enter into new energy supply contracts on commercially acceptable terms. Furthermore, natural catastrophes or similar events could affect the electricity or natural gas grids. Any such disruptions, or increases in energy costs as a result of the aforementioned factors or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Outokumpu has benefited fro m certain public subsidies and advantages and there can be no assurance that such subsidies and advantages w ill be available to Outokumpu in the fu tu re
Outokumpu has been granted public subsidies and advantages, including subsidies or advantages related to its research and development programs, through reductions of renewable energy charges and in connection with the construction and ramp up of the new Calvert production facility in the United States. The incentives primarily consist of sales, use and property tax abatements; income tax capital credits; various cash incentives, including training grants; and various other subsidies and non-financial benefits.
In Germany, the renewable energy charges that are generally payable under the German Renewable Energy Sources Act are significantly reduced for several Outokumpu companies as they benefit from special treatment for businesses with high electricity consumption. In the past, Outokumpu has received significant benefits from these reductions and it continued to be eligible for these reductions under the revised German Renewable Energy Sources Act, which became effective on January 1, 2012. On August 1, 2014 a new German Renewable Energy Act came into force which has been aligned with the European Commission and is in line with European state aid law. Based on this new act, Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH will be entitled to receive exemptions from the renewable energy charges in the same scope as in the past also in the coming years. While Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH will continue to receive such benefits in the coming years there can be no assurance that Outokumpu will continue to receive these benefits in the future as the German Renewable Energy Act may be amended or that Outokumpu will not cease to qualify for these advantages under the current law. Further, should the exemptions for energy intensive industries be found to constitute state-aid, Outokumpu may be required to repay the exempted amounts retroactively.
All public subsidies and advantages that have been granted to Outokumpu are subject to certain terms and conditions and if these terms and conditions are not complied with, Outokumpu could face significant financial or other materially adverse consequences, including the requirement to fully or partially repay, the subsidies and advantages granted (as well as costs, interest, penalties and/or damages). In addition, all public subsidies and advantages that have been granted to Outokumpu could be revoked due to conditions beyond the Outokumpu's control and the loss of any such subsidies or advantages could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition and results of operations and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
O u toku m pu 's estim ates o f chrom ite reserves a n d resou rces a t th e K em i m in e m a y exceed th e a ctu a l reserves and resources and there can be no assurance that the expected m ining capacity will be reached or that ferrochrom e production will be economicallyfeasible
Outokumpu's ferrochrome production operations are affected by the amount of estimated ore reserves at the Kemi chromite mine that can be exploited in an economically profitable manner as well as the amount of mineral resources that can be converted into reserves. In addition, the actual ore reserves may not conform to geological, metallurgical or other expectations. There can also be no assurance that the anticipated chromite extraction capacities will be achieved or that mining and processing operations will be economically profitable. Lower market prices, increased production costs, reduced recovery rates and other factors may render exploitation of
47

chromite at the Kemi mine uneconomical and may result in revision of Outokumpu's ore reserve and mineral resource estimates from time to time. If Outokumpu's actual ore reserves or mineral resources are less than the current estimates, it could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
I f Outokumpu were unable to continue selling account receivables under certain sale o f receivables program s, Outokumpu m ay need to refinance such program s andfacilities
Certain Outokumpu companies have used sale of receivables programs with various counterparties on an ongoing basis in order to finance a portion of their underlying business. Outokumpu's accounts receivables that have been transferred to counterparties and are derecognized from the balance sheet, but are reported in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, amounted to EUR 287 million as at December 31, 2015. Substantially all risks and rewards relating to those receivables had been transferred to counterparties. If the sale of receivable programs described above were cancelled or could not be utilized in the same manner for any reason, Outokumpu would have to seek alternative financing. As there is no assurance that Outokumpu would be able to obtain alternative financing, the cancellation or unavailability of such receivables programs could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Costs related to defined benefit plan s could increase, which could have a m aterial adverse effect on O u toku m pu 's business, fin a n c ia l condition a n d results o f operations
Outokumpu has established several defined benefit and defined contribution plans in various countries. Outokumpu's most significant defined benefit pension plans are in the United Kingdom, where the plan is funded based upon local regulations, and Germany, where the plan is unfunded. As at December 31, 2015, Outokumpu's net defined benefit obligations amounted to EUR 295 million. The valuation was not based on the same assumptions as the IFRS valuation, which showed a surplus. Outokumpu is exposed to various risks related to these defined benefit plans, including the risk of actual returns on plan assets being less than the expected rates of return and the risk of results deviating from actuarial assumptions for areas such as mortality of plan participants. The funding valuation of Outokumpu's defined benefit plan in the United Kingdom revealed a deficit of GBP 27 million in the first quarter of 2015. The deficit recovery payments commenced in February 2016 and the next valuation will be as at January 1, 2017.
Any of these risks, if they were to materialize, could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Changes in underlying assum ptions o f the carrying value o f certain assets, including as a result o f adverse m arket conditions, could result in im pairm ent o f such assets, including intangible assets such as goodw ill
For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 no impairment losses were recognized as a result of the performed impairment test. However, due to restructuring in Germany, impairment losses of EUR 6 million were recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 relating to land and EUR 27 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 relating to construction work in progress and machinery and equipment. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 net impairment losses of EUR 3 million and EUR 3 million, respectively, were recognized related to trade receivables. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, Outokumpu recorded impairment losses of EUR 13 million, mainly related to trade receivables. Outokumpu may have to make further impairments of its asset values, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Outokumpu's assets included goodwill of EUR 467 million as at December 31, 2015. Goodwill is tested for impairment quarterly or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. While impairment of goodwill does not affect reported cash flows, it does result in a non-cash charge in the consolidated statement of income and could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's results
48

of operations and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
O u toku m pu 's tax burden cou ld increase due to changes in ta x law s or regulations or th eir application, or as a result o f current orfu tu re tax audits
Outokumpu's tax burden is dependent on specific aspects of tax laws and regulations in several jurisdictions, including their application and interpretation. Changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation or application could significantly increase Outokumpu's tax burden.
Due to the international nature of its business, Outokumpu is subject to the tax law and regulations of several jurisdictions, in particular with regard to transfer pricing rules that apply in certain jurisdictions. Pursuant to such rules, related enterprises must conduct any inter-company transactions on an arm's length basis and must provide sufficient documentation thereof, subject to the applicable rules of the relevant jurisdiction. Although Outokumpu has transfer pricing policies in place, tax authorities may challenge Outokumpu's compliance with applicable transfer pricing rules. In addition, Outokumpu is subject to regular tax audits by the national tax authorities. As a result of current or future tax audits or other review actions of the relevant market surveillance authorities or tax authorities, additional taxes (including income taxes, withholding taxes, real estate taxes, capital taxes, stamp duties and value added taxes) could be assessed, which could lead to an increase in Outokumpu's tax liabilities, either as a result of the relevant tax payment being assessed directly against Outokumpu or as a result of Outokumpu becoming liable for the relevant tax as a secondary obligor.
F luctuations in fo re ig n exch an ge rates cou ld have a m a teria l adverse effect on O u to k u m p u 's business, financial condition and results o f operations
A major part of the Group's sales is in euros and US dollars. A significant part of expenses arise in euros, US dollars, Swedish kronas, Mexican pesos and British pounds. Due to the disposal of SKS shares in December 2015 and remaining shares February 2016 the exposure to changes in yuan exchange rate decreased clearly. In Europe, Outokumpu's products are priced mainly in euros and therefore costs in Swedish krona and British pounds give rise to a significant foreign exchange risk impacting profitability and cash flows. Due to significant amount of captive ferrochrome production and related revenues being linked to US dollar, the EUR/USD exchange rate risk for the Group is significant. In addition, stainless steel contribution margin is impacted by the value of US dollar. Exchange rates may also affect the relative competitiveness of stainless steel producers located in countries that use currencies other than the euro and fluctuations in the exchange rate between those currencies and the euro could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Outokumpu hedges most of its fair value risks, including risks related to accounts receivables, accounts payables, interest-bearing debt, cash and loan receivables denominated in currencies other than the euro. Outokumpu hedges the majority of its cash flow risk related to firm commitments and it selectively hedges its risk related to forecasted and probable cash flows. Outokumpu aims to hedge most of its fair value risks and the majority of its cash flow risk related to firm commitments. However, there can be no assurance that Outokumpu's hedging policy will mitigate the impact of adverse foreign exchange fluctuation on Outokumpu's results of operations.
Outokumpu has income translation risk mainly in US dollars, Swedish kronas and British pounds and based on its risk management policy this risk is not hedged. The Group has significant currency denominated net investment positions in US dollars, Swedish kronas and British pounds. As at December 31, 2015, there were no hedges related to net investment exposure. The effective portion of gains (as at December 31, 2015, EUR 17 million (net of tax)) on earlier financial year net investment hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. In 2015 Outokumpu reduced currency denominated equity e.g. in Australia and Mexico. Currency denominated debt and changes in currency rates have an impact on Group's capital structure.
49

Outokumpu is exposed to interest rate risk on its flo a tin g rate debt and the fa ir value o f its fin an cial assets and liabilities
As at March 31, 2016, Outokumpu's long-term debt and current debt was EUR 1,717 million. Significant part of Outokumpu's interest-bearing debt is floating rate based. In addition to exposures related to market level of interest rates, Outokumpu is also exposed to market level of credit margins. The volatility of credit margins has been high in recent years and, combined with the high level of its indebtedness, Outokumpu considers this risk to be significant. Outokumpu's interest rate risk is monitored as cash flow risk (impact of rate changes on net interest expenses) and fair value risk (impact of rate changes on fair value of monetary assets and liabilities). Outokumpu has established an interest rate hedging policy and uses interest rate swaps to manage the effects of changes in interest rates. Any increase or decrease in interest rates would affect Outokumpu's current interest expenses and its future refinancing costs. The default of a counterparty to any of the hedges or the early termination of any hedging transaction may lead to increased costs or the loss of the planned protective mechanism. In addition, Outokumpu could be unable to use hedging instruments in line with its hedging strategy or may incur increased costs, or not be able to hedge at all, due to the conditions in the financial markets, Outokumpu's own financial situation, especially its level of indebtedness, its credit ratings or other factors. There can be no assurance that Outokumpu will be able to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or that any hedging policy will mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate fluctuations on its results of operations and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Outokumpu is subject to stringent health and safety laws and regulations th at m ay give rise to significant costs and liabilities
Outokumpu is subject to a broad range of health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates and these laws and regulations impose increasingly stringent health and safety protection standards. The costs of complying with, and the liabilities imposed pursuant to, health and safety laws and regulations could be significant, and failure to comply could result in the assessment of civil and criminal penalties, suspension of permits, temporary or permanent closure of production facilities, or claims or lawsuits by third parties.
Despite Outokumpu's efforts to monitor and prevent accidents at its production facilities, operations relating to mining, smelting and hot and cold rolling, in particular, involve inherent hazards due to the processes, raw materials and temperatures involved. Accordingly, health and safety incidents have in the past occurred at Outokumpu's production facilities, and are likely to continue to occur in the future, which may result in costs and other liabilities or otherwise adversely affect Outokumpu's reputation or the continuity of the operations of the affected facility. Such accidents could include fires, explosions, gas leaks, vehicular accidents, other accidents involving persons or property, or exposure to radioactive materials included in scrap metal or other potentially hazardous materials. In addition, Outokumpu's industrial activities involve the use, storage and transport of dangerous chemicals and toxic substances. Outokumpu is, therefore, subject to the risk of industrial accidents that could lead to production stoppages, the loss of key assets and employees (and those of sub contractors and suppliers) or injuries to persons living near affected sites. In recent years, there have been fatal accidents at Outokumpu's production facilities in the United States and in Mexico.
Outokumpu also operates an underground chromite mine in Kemi, Finland. Mining operations are subject to a number of hazards and risks usually associated with the exploration, development and production of natural resources, any of which could result in production shortfalls or damage to persons or property. In particular, hazards associated with underground mining operations include fires, explosions, accidents and conditions resulting from drilling, blasting, removing and processing material from an underground mine. The occurrence of any of these events could delay production, increase production costs and result in death or injury to employees, damage to property and liability for Outokumpu, some or all of which may not be covered by insurance, as well as substantially harm Outokumpu's reputation as a company focused on ensuring the health and safety of its employees.
Substitute materials and new technologies could reduce m arketprices and dem andfo r stainless steelproducts
Stainless steel competes with substitute materials such as aluminum (particularly in the automotive industry), cement, composites, glass, ceramics, plastic, wood and carbon steel. Changes in customer preferences, pricing of
50

competing products, development of new or improved substitutes for stainless steel products and government regulatory initiatives mandating the use of such materials in lieu of stainless steel could reduce prices of, or demand for, stainless steel products. Price competition with respect to established grades of stainless steel and other products as well as other factors have recently resulted in new, lower quality stainless steel grades, mainly from Asia, and especially China, being marketed primarily to Asian markets. For example, chromium manganese steel grades (often called 200 series stainless steel grades) are marketed as a substitute for certain stainless steel grades, although they have inferior corrosion resistance, formability and weldability as compared to more established stainless steel grades. Lack of user knowledge about and experience with these new, lower quality stainless steel grades, their properties and their handling could result in these lower quality products being used in unsuitable applications or inappropriate manners simply because they are less expensive, which could have a negative effect on the image of stainless steel products in general. Outokumpu believes that stainless steel has a positive image as a high quality product and in the past, Outokumpu has invested in creating this image. Customer disappointment with products made from lower quality stainless steel, or any other negative effect on the image of stainless steel, could reduce the value of Outokumpu's past investments in the image of stainless steel or require Outokumpu to make future investments in maintaining or improving the image of stainless steel. Further, if customers accept products made from lower quality stainless steel grades that are cheaper than Outokumpu's stainless steel products as replacements for established stainless steel products, prices of and demand for Outokumpu's products may decline.
In addition, the stainless steel market is characterized by evolving technology standards that require improved quality, changing customer specifications and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. The products or manufacturing processes of the customers that use Outokumpu's stainless steel products may change from time to time due to improved technologies or product enhancements. These changes may require Outokumpu to develop new products and enhancements for its existing products. In addition, the emergence of new technologies could result in certain products containing stainless steel becoming obsolete. Failure to keep pace with market changes or to produce stainless steel products that meet customers' specifications and quality standards in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
F in an cial difficulties or bankruptcy o f one or m ore o f O u toku m pu 's m a jo r custom ers or suppliers co u ld have a m aterial adverse effect on O u toku m pu 's business, fin a n c ia l condition a n d results o f operations
Some of Outokumpu's customers and suppliers have experienced financial and operational challenges throughout the recent financial downturn. The continuation or exacerbation of the difficulties experienced by these customers or suppliers could place them in additional financial and operational distress or could even result in bankruptcy. Additionally, a number of Outokumpu's customers are, or could in the future be, under pressure from imports in their own domestic markets and may consequently lose market share or even have to relocate their production facilities to other markets. These factors could cause Outokumpu's customers to reduce the volume of their stainless steel purchases in an effort to improve their own financial condition, which could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's sales. Moreover, the potential inability of Outokumpu to collect outstanding accounts receivables on a timely basis, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's sales and cash flow. Although it has insurance that covers the majority of its receivables, Outokumpu has some risk due to unsecured sales. See "--Outokumpu's insurance policies provide limited coverage, potentially leaving it uninsured against some risks" below. Similarly, any financial difficulties experienced by Outokumpu's suppliers could result in an interruption in the supply of raw materials. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
O u toku m pu 's operations in certain countries cou ld b e adversely affected b y politica l, econom ic a n d legal developm ents in the countries concerned
Outokumpu has a business strategy partially focused on business operations in countries in which the political, economic and legal systems are less predictable than in countries with more developed institutional structures. Political or economic upheaval, changes in laws and other factors could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's results of operations and/or impair the value of its investments in such countries. The most significant risks of operating in emerging market countries arise from the establishment or enforcement of
51

foreign exchange restrictions, which could effectively prevent Outokumpu from receiving profits from, or selling its investments in, these countries. For example, Argentina and Mexico impose foreign exchange controls on foreign companies established in those countries. Legal and regulatory systems in emerging market countries are also typically less developed and not as well enforced as in Western European countries, which creates uncertainty in the operating environment. In addition, the need for qualified employees in emerging market countries may require Outokumpu to hire foreign trained employees, which may reduce the cost competitiveness of its operations. Expansion in emerging market countries also places greater pressure on monitoring corrupt behavior, in particular in countries that have experienced governmental corruption in the past. Outokumpu's reputation could be severely harmed due to corrupt behavior by its employees and could also subject Outokumpu to fines and other sanctions.
In addition to risks related to the political, economic and legal developments of the emerging countries, Outokumpu is also exposed to the risk of the United Kingdom exiting the EU, which, if materialized, might have a negative impact on the general economic activity and therefore also impact on demand for stainless steel in Europe. Furhermore, the Group's United Kingdom based operations might come across to trade barriers as regards to some key markets. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.

Stainless steel and ferrochrome production processes are dependent on the continuous operation of critical production equipment, including furnaces, continuous casters, rolling mills and electrical equipment (e.g., electric motors and transformers), and production downtime may occur as a result of unanticipated mechanical failures or other events. Outokumpu's production facilities have experienced and may in the future experience, plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures. Operations may also be disrupted for a variety of other reasons, including fire, explosion, release of substances harmful to the environment or health, strikes or transportation disruptions. Furthermore, accidents may lead to production downtimes with respect to certain machinery or plants or even plant closures, including for the duration of any ongoing investigation. To the extent that lost production as a result of such disruptions could not be compensated for by the production of unaffected facilities, such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Primarily due to the high temperatures required for stainless steel and ferrochrome production, fire is a significant risk for Outokumpu. Most of Outokumpu's production facilities are located in extensive industrial zones. A fire in any industrial zone could lead to major property damage and interruptions in production.
In addition, extreme weather events and natural disasters could affect Outokumpu's operations, especially through physical risks such as property damage or loss of production through floods, hurricanes or drought. Currently, only two of Outokumpu's production facilities, the Wildwood pipe production facility in Florida, and the Calvert production facility in Alabama, United States, are located in areas defined as "regional hotspots." These sites are moderately exposed to severe weather and high winds either from the hurricane potential or the effects of regular severe thunderstorms and tornados common to this geographical area. In addition, ice conditions in the Baltic Sea may block vessels from Tornio, which could delay the delivery of products and raw materials between Tornio and other ports and have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition and results of operations and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Outokumpu charters vessels to transport stainless steel products and raw materials, which subjects Outokumpu to risks inherent to vessels
Outokumpu has time chartered four vessels to transport stainless steel products from Tornio to customers mainly through its service center in Terneuzen, the Netherlands, and to transport black hot band to Outokumpu's production facilities in Germany. These vessels also transport raw materials, primarily from Terneuzen, but also from other harbors on the Baltic Sea to Tornio. While Outokumpu does not own or operate the vessels, it is liable for, among others, the cargo transported by the vessels. Outokumpu aims to charter modern vessels
52

designed for conditions of the Baltic Sea; however, these vessels are still at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as collisions, bad weather, mechanical failures, human error, terrorism, piracy and other similar circumstances or events. Outokumpu may increasingly face similar risks in the future, as it is expected to spot charter more vessels, primarily to transport ferrochrome and stainless steel from Tornio to Calvert. All of these hazards could result in death or injury to persons, loss of revenues or property, environmental damage, higher insurance rates, damage to Outokumpu's customer relationships, delays and rerouting. Outokumpu maintains insurance to mitigate some of the potential costs described above, but its insurance may not be sufficient to cover the liabilities suffered by it due to the occurrence of one or more of the risks described above. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition and results of operations as well as on its reputation and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
O u toku m pu 's insurance p o licies p ro v id e lim ited coverage, p o ten tia lly leavin g it u n in su red again st som e risks
While Outokumpu maintains insurance on property and equipment in amounts believed to be consistent with industry practices, it is not fully insured against all risks, and insurance against some risks may not be available. Outokumpu's main insurance policies cover physical loss of or damage to its property and equipment on a reinstatement basis arising from a number of specified risks and certain consequential losses, including business interruption arising from the occurrence of an insured event. Under these policies, damages and losses caused by certain natural disasters are also covered. Outokumpu also maintains various other types of insurance relating to its operations as well as trade credit insurance on receivables from certain customers, subject to limits that it believes are consistent with those in the stainless steel industry, in order to protect it against the risk of non payment due to the insolvency of such customers or other reasons. Not all of Outokumpu's customer receivables are or can be insured, and even when insurance is available, it may not fully cover the exposure. Notwithstanding the insurance coverage that Outokumpu carries, the occurrence of an accident that causes losses in excess of limits specified under the relevant policy or is subject to material deductibles, or losses arising from events not covered by insurance policies, could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
P ro d u ct liability claim s or loss o f p ro d u c t certifications c o u ld h ave a m a teria l adverse effect on O u toku m pu 's business, financial condition and results o f operations
Outokumpu's products are used in a wide range of applications. For example, certain of Outokumpu's products are used in safety-critical applications, such as pipes used in the oil, gas, chemical and petrochemical industry. In addition, certain of Outokumpu's stainless steel products are used in the automotive industry, where key customers require extensive third-party certifications regarding the products purchased. Any failure by Outokumpu to meet the qualifications needed to receive the necessary third-party certifications or the loss of existing third-party certifications may lead to the loss of business opportunities, which could lead to a decline in sales.
The performance, quality and safety of Outokumpu's products are critical to the success of its business. These characteristics depend significantly on the effectiveness of quality control systems, which in turn depends on a number of factors, including the quality of the training programs, the design of the systems, and Outokumpu's ability to ensure that its employees adhere to quality control guidelines and policies. Any significant failure or deterioration of Outokumpu's quality control systems could have a material adverse effect on its reputation and could result in product liability claims. Outokumpu has limited product liability insurance that may not be sufficient to cover all potential liabilities. Accordingly, a major claim, or a series of smaller claims, for damages related to Outokumpu's products sold, or advice given to customers in connection with products sold, may not be fully covered by insurance, or may not be covered by insurance at all, which could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Outokum pu is, and m ay in the fu tu re be, involved in litigation and arbitration proceedings th at could adversely affect its business, fin an cial condition and results o f operations
A number of lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been, and may in the future be, asserted against Outokumpu, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, competition law, and health and safety matters.
53

These and any future legal proceedings are costly, divert management attention and may result in reputational damage for Outokumpu. See "Business Overview--Legal Proceedings" for information on Outokumpu's ongoing legal proceedings. An unfavorable outcome in any ongoing proceedings, or any proceedings that may arise in the future, could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
O u toku m pu 's governance, in tern al controls a n d com plian ce p ro cesses co u ld f a i l to p re v e n t regulatory penalties, reputational harm andfraud, both at operating subsidiaries and jo in t ventures
Outokumpu operates globally and its activities span multiple jurisdictions and complex regulatory frameworks at a time of increased enforcement activity and enforcement initiatives globally in areas such as competition law and anti-corruption. Outokumpu's governance and compliance processes may not prevent breaches of law or governance standards. Outokumpu also faces the risk of fraud by its employees as well as violations at its joint ventures and other companies in which it has an interest, particularly if it only has a minority stake and does not control accounting or other rules and protocols for the conduct of business. Outokumpu's failure to comply with applicable laws and other standards could subject it to fines, loss of operating licenses and reputational harm. Effective internal controls are necessary for Outokumpu to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent and detect fraud. If Outokumpu cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, this could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and reputation. Additionally, at the operational level, individual employees may not comply with Outokumpu's policies and guidelines and as a result may cause Outokumpu to incur compliance costs and cause reputational damage. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors and other third parties to lose confidence in Outokumpu's reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
O u toku m pu 's operations are su bject to various en viron m en tal laws, regulations a n d licenses a n d a fa ilu re to com ply with these laws and regulations could result in unexpected costs and other liabilities
Outokumpu is subject to various environmental laws, regulations and licenses governing, among other things, atmospheric emissions, water quality, solid and hazardous waste handling and disposal, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, and the remediation of contaminated properties. As these environmental laws, regulations and licenses are amended or as their application or enforcement is changed, significant costs in complying with new and more stringent regulations may be imposed on Outokumpu. Further, many of Outokumpu's operations require environmental and other regulatory permits or licenses that are subject to modification, renewal or, subject to certain conditions, revocation by the issuing authorities. In certain countries, the procedures for obtaining these permits or licenses are often long and complex and there can be no assurance that the requested permit or license will be granted or renewed. In addition, violations of applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties, revocation of permits and licenses, the curtailment or cessation of operations, third-party claims or any combination thereof. Further, changes to existing production facilities or the construction of new production facilities require extensive regulatory permits and approvals, and there can be no assurance that such permits and approvals would be granted with the anticipated terms or within the targeted time frame.
Contamination has been identified at various Outokumpu production sites. For example, at the Dillenburg, Krefeld and Benrath sites in Germany, the soil and groundwater is contaminated either with metals from acids, oil, chlorinated solvents or chlorinated hydrocarbons. These contaminations are being investigated, monitored and remediated by Outokumpu and, in certain circumstances, by other responsible parties.
Remediation work has also been done in Wildwood, United States; at a former warehouse site in Montreal, Canada; and in Tornio, Finland, where an old landfill was closed. As at March 31, 2016, Outokumpu had environmental provisions of EUR 61 million in respect of remediation and other costs in its consolidated statement of financial position; however, there can be no assurance that such provisions will be sufficient. Future remediation may be required if new contamination occurs, existing contamination that is currently unknown is discovered, known contamination requires more extensive remediation than originally anticipated or environmental regulations or their enforcement become more stringent. The aforementioned could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects
54

and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Outokumpu m ay be adversely affected by any fu tu re application o f restrictions in regard to greenhouse gas em issions or in regard to sulfur emissions and fa c e risks associated with identifying and controlling the cost o f compliance with emission allowance schemes
Increased restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions stemming from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (the "ETS") could place Outokumpu at a competitive disadvantage as compared to stainless steel producers located outside of EU in countries that do not apply corresponding ETSs or carbon costs. In addition, associated increases in costs to energy providers, market price of electricity and future reductions in carbon dioxide emissions targets could also place Outokumpu at a competitive disadvantage and have an adverse effect on Outokumpu's business.
Currently, six of Outokumpu's production units, located in the EU (Finland, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom), fall within the ETS. As unused emission allowances can be sold on financial markets, the ETS creates a financial incentive for companies to restrict their emissions of carbon dioxide. Conversely, if the level of a company's emissions of carbon dioxide exceeds the rights in its possession, sufficient allowances for the emissions must be purchased. Under the ETS, companies have to surrender one emission right for each tonne of carbon dioxide their production facilities emit.
To dissuade companies currently operating inside the EU from moving to countries without emission reduction targets, industries within the EU that are exposed to high carbon leakage will continue to receive free emission allowances during ongoing emission trading period between 2013 and 2020 but the amount of free allowances will steadily decrease. However, the free allocation for the year 2015 was, and the allocation for 2016 is estimated to be, sufficient for the Group's operations. As the stainless steel industry has been identified as one of the sectors that has a high risk of carbon leakage, Outokumpu's production facilities will continue to receive free emission allowances under an exemption at least until 2020. The amount of these free allowances will be based on historical activity and efficiency based benchmarks, which set forth a lower no-cost cap for carbon dioxide emissions for Outokumpu's production facilities in the EU. Nevertheless, Outokumpu may have to purchase emission rights in addition to those it will obtain free of charge under the exemption and the need to make such purchases could result in additional costs, which could be material. In addition, Outokumpu could incur even higher additional costs should its production facilities not continue to qualify for the exemption from auctioning. In this case, Outokumpu would have to purchase a steadily increasing amount of emission rights to cover its emissions.
According to the published proposal of EU Climate and Energy Package 2030 (EC, January 2014), future carbon dioxide emission reduction targets will become more stringent and Outokumpu will have to begin making preparations for operating in a more restrictive environment, which could result in increased costs and unplanned liabilities. Additionally, as the production of stainless steel and ferrochrome is energy intensive, Outokumpu's operations are sensitive to changes in the price of electricity. Power companies transfer the costs associated with their emission allowances to customers in the prices they charge for supplying electrical power, and marginal cost pricing in power markets means that wholesale power prices are affected by the price of these allowances. Therefore, Outokumpu is especially burdened by the electricity price increase caused by emissions trading. Indirect extra electricity costs for Outokumpu were, during the previous EU emissions trading periods from 2005 to 2015, approximately EUR 20 to 50 million annually. The EU has created a compensation mechanism for extra electricity costs due to ETS and according to EU rules, Outokumpu's extra electricity costs are partly and nationally compensated in Germany and the UK and from 2017 onwards compensated also in Finland. However, Outokumpu's electricity costs in Europe may increase in the future due to the ETS despite the fact that most of the electricity that it purchases is of the low-carbon variety. Increased electricity costs could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's results of operations in Europe and this effect is not mitigated by allocations of emission allowances at no cost. Risks connected with the future cost of emission allowances also add an element of uncertainty to the planning of new investments in Europe and may affect future investment decisions.
Directive 2012/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 21, 2012 amending Council Directive 1999/32/EC as regards the sulfur content of marine fuels revised the previous Directive regarding the sulfur content of certain liquid fuels and incorporated new International Maritime Organization standards into EU law to ensure their proper and harmonized enforcement by all EU member states. Under the amended
55

Directive, the maximum permissible sulfur content of maritime fuels used in sensitive areas, such as the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel, has decreased from the level of 1.5 percent to 0.1 percent as of January 1, 2015. Other areas will be subject to a reduction from 3.5 percent to 0.5 percent by January 1, 2020. The costs of the amended Directive have not been significant for Outokumpu due to generally decreased oil and energy prices but there can be no assurance that these costs are not increasing in the future leading to significantly increased transportation costs for products produced at the Tornio integrated production facility. This could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
F ailure to p ro te c t in tellectu al p ro p erty rights co u ld have a m a teria l adverse effect on O u toku m pu 's com petitiveness as w ell as on its business, fin an cial condition and results o f operations
Outokumpu believes that developing new stainless steel products and manufacturing technologies that can be differentiated from those of its competitors, such as duplex stainless steel grades, is important to the success of its business. Outokumpu takes active measures to obtain protection of its intellectual property by obtaining patents and undertaking monitoring activities in its major markets. In addition to its patent portfolio, Outokumpu relies on trade secrets, know-how, the development of new products, and technological development in combination with non-disclosure agreements and certain other agreements to protect intellectual property rights. However, there can be no assurance that the measures Outokumpu takes will effectively deter competitors from improper use of its intellectual property. Competitors may misappropriate intellectual property owned or licensed by Outokumpu, disputes as to ownership of intellectual property may arise and intellectual property may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. In addition, certain technologies and processes used by Outokumpu may be subject to the intellectual property rights of third parties in certain countries. Such third parties may take legal action for infringement of these intellectual property rights and any such claims could delay or prevent the delivery of products by Outokumpu. Any failure to protect Outokumpu's intellectual property or resulting claims of infringement on third-party intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's competitiveness as well as its business, financial condition and results of operations and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
A n y sign ifican t p ro b le m with inform ation system s co u ld have a m a teria l adverse effect on O u to k u m p u 's business, financial condition and results o f operations
Outokumpu's business relies on various applications and other information technologies that are used globally in all business areas and group functions. Many of these applications and underlying infrastructure are outdated, making them more vulnerable for failures, and could result in business interruptions, for example, in the production and supply chain processes. In addition, the enterprise architecture is complicated, especially due to the large number of different and unharmonized information systems increases the risk of loss of critical applications. Furthermore, cyber threats and other security threats could exploit possible weaknesses in Outokumpu's security controls, which in turn, could cause leakage of sensitive information, theft of intellectual property, production outage or damage to Outokumpu's reputation.
A sign ifican t portio n o f O u toku m pu 's em ployees in E u rope are co vered b y collective bargain in g agreem ents and Outokumpu m ay fa c e labor disruptions that could interfere with its operations
Outokumpu is subject to the risk of labor disputes and adverse employee relations that could disrupt its business operations. A significant portion of Outokumpu's employees in Europe are covered by collective bargaining agreements. However, there can be no assurance that the collective bargaining agreements will prevent strikes or work stoppages at any of Outokumpu's facilities, or that such agreements will be renewed on substantially similar terms and conditions in the future. Outokumpu has experienced work stoppages in the past, including in Germany and Finland, none of which significantly affected Outokumpu's operations. Although the impact of such work stoppages has historically been limited, there can be no assurance that any future work stoppage would not have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition and results of operations and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.

Outokumpufaces risks associated with nuclear power plantprojects in Finland
On August 5, 2015, Outokumpu announced that it had committed to increase its indirect share in Fennovoima Oy ("Fennovoima"), which was granted a decision-in-principle by the Government of Finland to build a new nuclear power plant in Finland, to approximately 14 percent. In 2013, Fennovoima selected Rusatom Overseas CJSC as a power plant supplier. According to the plans, infrastructure work at the site is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. The construction of the plant would begin after the infrastructure work and the power plant would start commercial operations in 2024. The project involves a number of potential risks for Outokumpu, including delays, cancellation, non-completion (for external or internal reasons), technical risks (including tightening nuclear safety regulations in the future), budget overruns (including non-competitive cost of power or increased cost of production), financing risks (including cost and availability of financing), political risks (including public acceptance risks) and environmental risks. When operational, shareholders will be able to procure electricity at cost against payment of their pro rata share of operating expenses of the power plant (socalled "Mankala" principle). Accordingly, there can be no assurance that one or more of the project risks will not occur or that Outokumpu's share of financing the project will not increase as a result of any future defaults of other shareholders in Fennovoima.
In addition, Outokumpu has an approximately 0.3 percent indirect share in the Teollisuuden Voima Oyj ("TVO") Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant project, which is currently under construction in Finland. It was originally expected that commercial operation of Olkiluoto 3 would begin in 2009; however, the project has been delayed on several occasions. In September 2014, TVO announced that according to the plant supplier the start of the regular electricity production of Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant unit will take place in late 2018. TVO's project involve similar risks for Outokumpu as those it faces due to its investment in Fennovoima.
F ailure to attract qu alified p e rso n n e l or a loss o f key p e rso n n e l c o u ld disru pt O u to k u m p u 's business a n d have a m aterial adverse effect on its business, fin a n cia l condition and results o f operations
Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and its ability to continue to maintain and grow its business as well as provide high quality products depend, to a large extent, on the contributions of its management team and key personnel. The loss of key individuals or other employees who have specific knowledge of, or relationships with, trade customers in the markets in which Outokumpu operates could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition and results of operations. Outokumpu's success also depends, to a great extent, on its ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees throughout the organization. Outokumpu has implemented human resources processes to attract and retain senior managers for positions considered to be important for Outokumpu. However, if Outokumpu is unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees at all levels, it could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that Outokumpu will be able to retain such senior managers and key employees and successfully manage them, which could disrupt Outokumpu's business and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Risks Relating to the Notes, the Transaction Guarantees and the Transaction Security
The Notes m ay not be a suitable investmentfo r all investors
Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:
(i) have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or referred to in the Prospectus;
(ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on its overall investment portfolio;
(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes; and
57

(iv) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.
Investors are exposed to credit risk in respect o f the Issuer
Investors in the Notes are exposed to a credit risk in respect of the Issuer. The investor's possibility to receive interest payments and payments of principal under the Notes is thus dependent on the Issuer's ability to fulfill its payment obligations, which in turn is to a large extent dependent on developments in the Issuer's business and the Issuer's financial performance.
Credit ratings assigned to the Notes and the Issuer m ay not be accurate and an increase o f rating m ay decrease the restrictions under the Notes
The Notes have been assigned a credit rating of `B2' by Moody's. The Issuer has a corporate family rating (CFR) of B3 and B3-PD probability default rating (PDR) from Moody's. The rating report on the Issuer was issued by Moody's on March 29, 2016. Such ratings do not necessarily reflect the potential impact of the risk factors described in this section, and other risk factors may affect the value of the Notes. Further, the credit ratings assigned by Moody's to the Notes and the Issuer may not reflect the credit ratings that other credit rating agencies may assign to the Notes and/or the Issuer. A credit rating does not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or hold Notes and may be revised, suspended, modified or withdrawn by Moody's at any time. Further, in the event that the Issuer's business, financial condition or prospects would be adversely impacted, the credit rating for the Issuer or the Notes could be downgraded, which may affect negatively the value of the Notes.
If the Issuer receives one or more of the following: (a) a rating of "BBB-" or higher from Standard & Poor's Rating Services or (b) a rating of "Baa3" or higher from Moody's, pursuant to the Terms and Conditions of the Notes the restrictions on additional financial indebtedness, mergers and demergers, disposals and subsidiary guarantees are suspended for as long as the Issuer holds such rating. An increase of the credit rating may therefore result in these restrictions no longer being applicable with respect to the Notes.
Active trading m arketfo r the Notes m ay not develop
The Notes constitute a new issue of securities and there has been no prior public market for the Notes. Although application has been made to list the Notes on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, there can be no assurance that such application will be approved. Further, even if the listing application is approved, there can be no assurance that a liquid public market for the Notes will develop, and even if such a market were to develop, neither the Issuer nor the Lead Managers are under any obligation to maintain such a market. In the absence of a secondary market, Notes may be difficult to sell at a satisfactory market price and the investor should be aware that he may realize a loss upon sale if Notes are sold prior to the redemption date. Even if the Notes are listed on an exchange, trading in the Notes will not always take place. Thus, it may be difficult and costly for the holder of the Notes to sell Notes within a short time frame, or at all, and it may be difficult for the holder to obtain a price that is equivalent to the price obtainable for securities that are traded in a liquid secondary market.
The liquidity and the market price for the Notes can be expected to vary with changes in market and economic conditions, the financial condition and prospects of the Issuer and other factors that generally influence the market prices of securities. Such fluctuations may significantly affect the liquidity and the market price of the Notes, which may trade at a discount to the price at which the holder of Notes invested in the Notes.
Since the N otes bear interest at a fix e d interest rate, m ovem ents in m arket interest rates can adversely affect the value o f the Notes
The Notes bear interest on its outstanding principal amount at a fixed interest rate. A holder of a security with a fixed interest rate is exposed to the risk that the value of such security could fall as a result of changes in the market interest rate. While the nominal compensation rate of a security with a fixed interest rate is fixed during the life of such security or during a certain period of time, the current interest rate on the capital market (market interest rate) typically changes on a daily basis. If the market interest rate increases, the value of such a security typically falls, until the yield of such security is approximately equal to the market interest rate. If the market interest rate falls, the value of a security with a fixed interest rate typically increases, until the yield of such a
58

security is approximately equal to the market interest rate. Consequently, the holders of Notes should be aware that movements of the market interest rate can adversely affect the value of the Notes and can lead to losses for the holders of Notes if they sell their Notes.
Laws and practices applicable to the Notes m ay change
The Notes are issued under Finnish law in force on the issue date. Any new statutes, ordinances and regulations, amendments to the legislation or changes in application of the law (including any amendments to or changes in application of tax laws or regulations) after the issue date may affect the Notes and/or have a material adverse effect on the Issuer, which could affect the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as the market price and value of the Notes.
Legal investm ent considerations m ay restrict certain investments
The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent (i) Notes are legal investments for it, (ii) Notes can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing and (iii) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any Notes. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.
The N otes carry no votin g righ ts a t the Issu e r's G eneral M eetin gs o f Shareholders
The Notes carry no voting rights with respect to the General Meetings of Shareholders of the Issuer. Consequently, in the Issuer's General Meetings of Shareholders the holders of Notes cannot influence any decisions by the Issuer to redeem the Notes or any decisions by the Issuer's shareholders concerning, for instance, the capital structure of the Issuer, which could impact the Issuer's ability to make payments on the Notes.
Outokumpu m ay be able to merge, effect asset sales or otherwise effect significant transactions that m ay have a m aterial adverse effect on the Notes and the holders o f Notes
The Issuer and its subsidiaries may be able to merge, effect asset sales or otherwise effect significant transactions. Although the Terms and Conditions contain restrictions on Outokumpu's ability to enter into a merger, demerger and asset sale transactions these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. Under the Terms and Conditions, in addition to specified permitted asset sales, Outokumpu will be able to merge with an entity outside Outokumpu and a subsidiary of the Issuer may demerge so long as on a pro forma basis the applicable gearing ratio is not exceeded as a result thereof and where assets are transferred outside the Group as a result thereof, the merger or demerger consideration, to the extent in cash, is applied similarly than as if such merger or demerger would have been a disposal. Also, such restrictions would pursuant to the Terms and Conditions become entirely non-applicable if the Issuer receives an Investment Grade Status. In the event the Issuer was to enter into any such transaction, holders of Notes may be materially and adversely affected.
Outokumpu m ay incur additional debt without the consent o f the holders o f the Notes
Outokumpu may be able to incur additional debt in the future. Although the credit agreements of Outokumpu as well as Condition 11.2 (Financial Indebtedness) and Condition 11.6 (Negative pledge) contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial and secured. Under the Terms and Conditions, in addition to specified permitted indebtedness and secured indebtedness, Outokumpu will be able to incur additional indebtedness so long as on a pro forma basis the applicable gearing ratio is not exceeded. Also, the restriction on additional financial indebtedness would pursuant to the Terms and Conditions become entirely non-applicable if the Issuer receives an Investment Grade Status. Incurring additional debt permitted under the Terms and Conditions may reduce the amount recoverable by the holders of Notes upon winding-up or insolvency of the Issuer.

O u toku m pu 's p o ssib le extensive indebtedness m a y h ave an adverse effect on th e Issu e r's ability to f u lf il its obligations under the Notes as well as on the m arketprice and value o f the Notes
Outokumpu requires, and expects to continue to require, a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources to finance its business. Possible extensive indebtedness, whether secured or unsecured, may have a significant effect on the operations of Outokumpu, such as (i) limit Outokumpu's ability to raise additional finance on corresponding or more favorable financial and other terms than currently in force in order to finance its future working capital needs, investments, acquisitions or other general operative needs; (ii) require that a considerable part of the cash flow from operating activities of Outokumpu be used for payments of the principle and interests of the debts, which would reduce the assets and cash flows available for operating activities and development of the operations; (iii) make Outokumpu more exposed to unfavorable financial conditions than its competitors, which could weaken the Issuer's competitiveness and (iv) expose Outokumpu to increases in interest rate levels. Although Outokumpu currently generates sufficient funds from operating cash flows to satisfy its debt service requirements and its capacity to obtain new financing is adequate, there can be no assurance that it will maintain such cash flows and adequate financial structure in the future. Inability to comply with any debt covenant included in Outokumpu's financing documents could result in a default under Outokumpu's debt obligations. This could result in the need to renegotiate Outokumpu's financing as a result of which the terms of financing may weaken.
If any payment default occurs, the Issuer's lenders may elect to declare all of the Issuer's outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In such circumstances, the lenders under the Issuer's credit agreements also have the right to terminate any commitments to provide further financing. If the Issuer is unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under the credit agreements may have the right to proceed against the Transaction Security in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any other collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which collateral is pursuant to the Terms and Conditions permitted to exist and be granted within the limits set out in Condition 11.6 (Negative pledge). If the payment of debt under the Issuer's credit agreements was accelerated, there can be no assurance that any such collateral would be sufficient to repay the Issuer's debt.
Should any of the above factors materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on Outokumpu's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes as well as on the market price and value of the Notes.
The Issuer m ay have an obligation to redeem and purchase the Notes prior to maturity
As specified in the Terms and Conditions, the holders of Notes are entitled to demand premature repayment of the Notes in case of an Event of Default (see Condition 12 (Acceleration o f the Notes)) or a Change of Control Event (see Condition 8.3 (Mandatory repurchase due to a Change o f Control Event (put option))). Such premature repayment may have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes of such holders of Notes who elect not to exercise their right to get their Notes prematurely repaid as well as the market price and value of such Notes.
In addition, as specified in the Terms and Conditions, the Issuer may at any time purchase Notes in any manner and at any price prior to maturity. Only if such purchases are made through a tender offer, such offer must be available to all holders of Notes on equal terms. The Issuer is entitled to retain, resell or nullify the Notes at its discretion. Consequently, a holder of Notes offering Notes to the Issuer in connection with such purchases may not receive the full invested amount. Furthermore, a holder of Notes may not have the possibility to participate in such purchases. The purchases - whether through tender offer or otherwise - may have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and, thereby, on the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes to such holders who do not participate in the purchases as well as the market price and value of such Notes.
Furthermore, in case at least 75 percent of the aggregate nominal principal amount of the Notes has been repurchased pursuant to a demand by the holders of Notes based on a Change of Control Event, the Issuer is entitled to prepay also the remaining outstanding Notes at a price per Note equal to 101 percent of the nominal amount of the Note together with accrued but unpaid interest by notifying the holders of Notes of such prepayment. Such early repayment initiated by the Issuer may incur financial losses or damage, among other
60

things, to such holders of Notes who had prepared themselves to have the amount of the Notes invested until the contractual final maturity of the Notes.
Such early repayment initiated by the Issuer may incur financial losses or damage, among other things, to such holders of Notes who had prepared themselves to have the amount of the Notes invested until the contractual final maturity of the Notes.
The Issuer has a right to redeem and purchase the Notes prior to maturity
As specified in the Terms and Conditions, in addition to the right for the Issuer to redeem remaining Notes in case at least 75 percent of the aggregate nominal principal amount of the Notes has been repurchased pursuant to a demand by the holders of Notes based on a Change of Control Event, the Issuer is entitled to redeem the Notes at any time prior to maturity either in full or in part (see Condition 8.4 (Voluntary total redemption), Condition 8.5 (Voluntary partial redemption) and Condition 8.6 (Voluntary partial redemption upon an Equity Offering)).
Before June 16, 2018, the premature redemption can only be made by way of a make-whole call and thereafter at the redemption price calculated in accordance with Condition 8.4 (Voluntary Total Redemption). The Issuer may, before June 16, 2018, once in each 12-month period redeem by notice up to 10 percent of the aggregate outstanding principal amount pro rata with respect to each Note at the redemption price per Note equal to 103 percent of the principal amount of each Note. If the Issuer carries out an equity offering, the Issuer may before June 16, 2018 redeem by net cash proceeds received by the Issuer from the offering up to 40 percent of the aggregate original principal amount pro rata with respect to each Note at the redemption price per Note equal to 107.250 percent of the principal amount of each Note, within 180 days from the closing of the equity offering.
Any such early redemption by the Issuer may incur financial losses or damage, among other things, to such holders of Notes who had prepared themselves to have the amount of the Notes invested until the contractual final maturity of the Notes.
The Issuer m ay not be able to finance the repurchase of Notes following a Change of Control Event
Upon a Change of Control Event, the holders of Notes are entitled to demand repurchase of the Notes at a price per Note equal to 101 percent of its nominal amount plus accrued interest to the date of such repurchase. The source for any repurchase required as a result of any such event will be available cash or cash generated from operating activities or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided by subsidiaries of the Issuer. If a Change of Control Event occurs, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will have or will be able to generate sufficient funds to repurchase the Notes that have been requested to be repurchased.
The Issuer is not obliged to compensatefo r withholding tax or sim ilar on the Notes
In the event of any withholding tax, public levy or similar is imposed in respect of payments to holders of Notes on amounts due pursuant to the Notes, the Issuer is neither obliged to gross-up or otherwise compensate holders of Notes for the lesser amounts the holders of Notes will receive as a result of the imposition of withholding tax or similar nor entitled to a premature redemption of the Notes.
Am endm ents to the Notes bind all holders o fNotes
The Terms and Conditions may be amended in certain circumstances, with the required consent of a defined majority of the holders of Notes. The Terms and Conditions contain provisions for calling meetings of the holders of the Notes to consider matters affecting the interests of the holders of Notes generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all holders of Notes including holders of Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and holders of Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.
61

Rights to payments under the Notes that have not been claimed within 3 years are prescribed
In case any payment under the Notes has not been claimed within three (3) years from the original due date thereof, the right to such payment shall be prescribed. Such prescription may incur financial losses to such holders of Notes who have not claimed payment under the Notes within three (3) years.
The com pletion o f th e transactions relatin g to th e N o tes is relian t on E u roclear F in la n d L td 's operations a n d system s
The Notes are issued in the book-entry securities system of Euroclear Finland Ltd, and consequently, no physical securities will be issued. The Notes are dematerialized securities and title to the Notes is recorded and transfers of the Notes are affected only through the relevant entries in the book-entry system and registers maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd and its account operators. Therefore, timely and successful completion of transactions relating to the Notes depends on the fact that the book-entry securities system is operational. Any malfunction or delay in the book-entry securities systems or failure by any party to the system may result in the transaction not to take place as expected or to be delayed, which may cause financial losses or damage to the holders of Notes whose rights depended on the timely and successful completion of the transaction. The Issuer or any other third party will not assume any responsibility for the timely and full functionality of the book-entry securities system.
The rights o f the holders o f the N otes depen d on th e N o teh o ld ers' A g e n t's a n d S ecu rity A g e n t's actions a n d fin an cial standing and the ability o f the Security A gent to enforce certain o f the Transaction Security m ay be restricted by local law
By subscribing for, or accepting the assignment of, any Note, each holder of a Note will accept the appointment of the Noteholders' Agent (being on the Issue Date Intertrust (Finland) Oy) to act on its behalf and to perform administrative functions relating to the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security. The Noteholders' Agent (for and on behalf of the holders of the Notes) has, in turn, acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement appointing the Security Agent as the agent and representative of certain secured creditors, to represent and act for such secured creditors, including the holders of the Notes (acting though the Noteholders' Agent), in relation to the Transaction Security and the Transaction Guarantees in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Noteholders' Agent has, among other things, the right to represent the holders of the Notes in all court and administrative proceedings in respect of the Notes and the sole right and legal authority to represent the holders of the Notes vis-a-vis the Security Agent. Only the Security Agent is entitled to exercise the rights under the Transaction Security and the Transaction Guarantees and enforce the same. However, the rights, duties and obligations of the Noteholders' Agent as the representative of the holders of the Notes are subject to the provisions of the Terms and Conditions and the Agency Agreement, and there is no specific legislation or market practice in Finland which would govern the Noteholders' Agent's performance of its duties and obligations relating to the Notes and, therefore, such matters will be governed by the provisions of the Terms and Conditions, the Agency Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement as well as general principles of Finnish law. No assurance can be given that the appointment of the agents, or the actions taken by such agents on behalf of the holders of the Notes will be valid and enforceable against all relevant parties. Should such appointments or actions be considered invalid or unenforceable, the holders of the Notes could find it difficult or impossible to enforce the security. Further, any failure by an agent to perform its duties and obligations properly, or at all, may adversely affect the enforcement of the rights of the holders of the Notes due to, for example, inability to realize the security and/or receive any or all amounts payable from the security in a timely and effective manner.
A failure by the Noteholders' Agent to perform its duties and obligations properly or at all may adversely affect the enforcement of the rights of the holders of the Notes. Under the Terms and Conditions, the funds collected by the Noteholders' Agent as the representative of the holders of the Notes must be held separately from the funds of the Noteholders' Agent and be treated as escrow funds to ensure that in the event of the Noteholders' Agent's bankruptcy, such funds can be separated for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. In the event the Noteholders' Agent would fail to separate the funds in an appropriate manner, the funds could be included in the Noteholders' Agent's bankruptcy estate.
The Noteholders' Agent may be replaced by a successor Noteholders' Agent in accordance with the Terms and Conditions. Generally, the successor Noteholders' Agent has the same rights and obligations as the retired
62

Noteholders' Agent. It may be difficult to find a successor Noteholders' Agent with commercially acceptable terms or at all. Further, it cannot be excluded that the successor Noteholders' Agent would not breach its obligations under the above documents or that insolvency proceedings would not be initiated against it.
Neither the Transaction Security nor the Transaction Guarantees are granted directly to the holders of the Notes but have been granted only in favor of the Security Agent as agreed in the Intercreditor Agreement and relevant Transaction Security Documents. Other creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement in the future. Among other things, the Intercreditor Agreement governs the enforcement of the Transaction Security, and provides that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Transaction Security on behalf of the Secured Parties, the sharing in any recoveries from such enforcement and the release of the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees by the Security Agent. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Transaction Security, except through the Security Agent, who will follow instructions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. For more information, see "Additional Information on the Transaction Guarantees, Transaction Security and Intercreditor Agreement".
In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Transaction Security is taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply.
Materialisation of any of the above risks may have a material adverse effect on the enforcement of the rights of the holders of the Notes and the rights of the holders of the Notes to receive payments under the Notes.
The Transaction Security m ay not be sufficient to cover all the Secured Obligations and the enforcem ent o f the security m ay be delayed or the security m ay not be enforceable at all
There is no assurance that the Transaction Security, benefiting, among others, the holders of the Notes, will be sufficient to cover all the Secured Obligations and, therefore, all the Issuer's payment obligations under the Notes may not be secured, if at all. For example, the Intercreditor Agreement includes a right, under certain conditions, for additional creditors to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement (either as a result of refinancing of the liabilities to the original secured creditors or as a result of incurrence of additional indebtedness) which may increase the amount of Secured Obligations and accordingly reduce the proportionate share of the holders of the Notes of the Transaction Security. The receivables of the holders of the Notes rank pari passu with the receivables of the other secured creditors except for certain liabilities owed to the Security Agent and certain enforcement costs of the secured creditors, which will have priority to the enforcement proceeds of the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees.
In addition, any enforcement may be delayed due to any inability to sell the security assets in a timely and efficient manner.
The enforcem ent o f security w ill be subject to the procedures and lim itations set out in an Intercreditor Agreement
Even if the security were granted and were enforceable, the enforcement is subject to the procedures and limitations agreed in the Intercreditor Agreement. As there are secured creditor groups that would represent a larger portion of the Secured Obligations than the holders of the Notes, there can be no assurance as to the ability of the holders of the Notes without the support of the other creditor groups to (through the Noteholders' Agent) instruct the Security Agent to initiate any enforcement procedures. The Intercreditor Agreement also contains limitations on the ability of different creditor groups to take action under the Intercreditor Agreement and, therefore, any enforcement of security may be delayed due to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.
Insolvency administrator m ay not respect the Intercreditor Agreement
The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions for the sharing between the Secured Parties of the proceeds received from the enforcement of the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees. If a Secured Party receives enforcement proceeds or other payments in excess of what is stipulated by the Intercreditor Agreement,
63

such Secured Party is obligated to share such proceeds or payments with the other Secured Parties. However, it is not certain that a Secured Party or a bankruptcy administrator of such Secured Party would respect the Intercreditor Agreement which potentially could adversely affect the other Secured Parties.
The shorter tenor o f the other Secured Obligations may have a negative impact on the interests o f the N o teh o ld ers.
While the Transaction Security secures the Secured Parties pari passu (with certain exception), the Notes and the other Secured Obligations do not have the same tenor and the Issuer may amortise and make prepayments under the other Secured Obligations without having to make corresponding amortisations or prepayments under the Notes. The shorter tenor of the other Secured Obligations could have a negative impact on the interests of the Noteholders.
The Intercreditor Agreem ent and the Transaction Security Docum ents m ay be am ended without the consent o f the Noteholders
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes provide for the Noteholders' Agent to agree to amendments and replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement and grant waivers and consents and give written instructions in respect of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents without consulting the Noteholders provided that the ranking of external debt and the priority of payments under such debt does not become less beneficial to the Noteholders than under the Intercreditor Agreement in force on the Issue Date and that in relation to Transaction Security Documents such amendment, waiver, consent or instructions do not relate to a release of the Transaction Security except as expressly agreed in the Terms and Conditions. Any of the before-mentioned actions may result in less beneficial rights and more cumbersome obligations for the Noteholders under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents.
The Notes and each o f the Transaction Guarantees are structurally subordinated to present and future liabilities o f non-Guarantor subsidiaries
The Noteholders (and the other Secured Parties) benefit from guarantees provided by certain of the Issuer's subsidiaries. In the event of insolvency, liquidation or a similar event relating to one of the guarantors, all other creditors of such subsidiary would be entitled to payment out of the assets of such subsidiary with the same priority as the Noteholders to the extent the Transaction Security does not provide for a prioritised position for the Secured Parties. In case of such an insolvency event in a subsidiary not being a guarantor, an entity within the Group, as a shareholder, or the Noteholders as Secured Parties in relation to a share pledge over the shares in such subsidiary would be entitled to any payments only after the other creditors have received full payment for their claims. Thus the Notes are in the latter case structurally subordinated to the liabilities of such subsidiaries.
Defaults by, or the insolvency of, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer could result in the obligation of the Group to make payments under parent company financial or performance guarantees in respect of such subsidiaries' obligations or the occurrence of cross defaults on certain borrowings of the Group.
The Transaction Guarantees and Transaction Security are subject to certain limitations on enforcem ent and m ay be lim ited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that m ay lim it their validity and enforceability
According to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents certain Transaction Guarantees and the Transaction Security will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by the relevant Guarantor or Security Provider without rendering the relevant Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law and enforcement of each Transaction Guarantee and Transaction Security would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally.
Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court could subordinate or void the Transaction Guarantees or Transaction Security granted under the Intercreditor Agreement and by relevant Transaction Security Documents and, if payment had already been
64

made under a Transaction Guarantee or upon enforcement of the Transaction Security, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor or Security Provider, if the court found that:
· the relevant Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or Security Provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or Security Provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security;
· the Guarantor or Security Provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the relevant Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security and the Guarantor or Security Provider was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;
· the relevant Transaction Guarantees or Transaction Security were held to exceed the corporate objective of the Guarantor or Security Provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or Security Provider; or
· the amount paid or payable under the relevant Transaction Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds in respect of the Transaction Security was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.
The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:
· the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets;
· the present fair salable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or
· it cannot pay its debts as they become due.
If a court were to find that the granting of a Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security was a fraudulent conveyance or held it unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that such Transaction Security or the payment obligations under such Transaction Guarantee is ineffective, and/or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to such Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, the Noteholders may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or the benefit of such Transaction Security and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of the other Guarantors under any Transaction Guarantees that have not been declared void and benefit of other Transaction Security that have not been declared void.
Additionally, any future pledge of Transaction Security might be avoidable by the security provider (as debtorin-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge, the pledge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within three months following the pledge, or in certain circumstances, a longer period. In order to receive the benefit of a security interest, the secured creditors must hold secured claims (i.e., the secured party and the creditor have to be the same person).
In addition, under the Terms and Conditions and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Group will be permitted in the future to incur additional indebtedness and other obligations that may share the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees. The granting of new security interests may require the releasing and retaking of security or otherwise create new hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and it may not be possible to enforce it.
65

Further, the Transaction Guarantees and the Transaction Security, or the enforcement thereof, will be subject to certain contractual or other limitations or subordinated under applicable law. The enforcement of the Transaction Guarantees and the Transaction Security will be limited to the extent that the granting of such Transaction Guarantees and the Transaction Security is not in the corporate interest of the relevant guarantor or provider of security, would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws or where the burden of such Transaction Guarantee or Transaction Security exceed the benefit to the relevant guarantor or provider of security. In particular, contractual limits may be applicable to certain Transaction Guarantees or Transaction Security to the extent the granting of such Transaction Guarantee or enforcement of relevant Transaction Security would result in a breach of capital maintenance rules or other statutory laws or would cause the directors of any Guarantor or provider of Transaction Security to contravene their duties to incur civil or criminal liability or to contravene any legal prohibition.
Enforcing rights under the N otes or the Transaction Guarantees or the Transaction Security across m ultiple jurisdictions m ay prove difficult
The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Finland and certain of the Guarantors and Security Providers are incorporated or organized under the laws of various other jurisdictions. The Transaction Security includes the shares of certain of the Issuer's subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of these jurisdictions. The Transaction Guarantees are provided under the Intercreditor Agreement which is governed by English law. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in various jurisdictions. Such multijurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of the Noteholders' rights. Noteholders rights under the Notes, the Transaction Guarantees and the Transaction Security will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the Security Agent will be able to effectively enforce the Secured Parties' rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The multijurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Transaction Security may limit the realizable value of the Transaction Security. The validity of the Transaction Security may be subject to challenge and Transaction Security may be set aside in insolvency proceedings.
Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all Transaction Security give the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Transaction Security or whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent priority in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Agent and holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the assets subject to Transaction Security.
Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees m ay be released under certain circumstances
In addition to the authority for the Security Agent to release relevant part of the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees and to discharge Secured Obligations and certain intra-group liabilities in order to facilitate enforcement of Transaction Security or a distressed disposal or appropriation made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that in connection with a disposal of an asset by a member of the Group permitted under the terms of the secured financing under non-distressed circumstances, the Security Agent is under the Intercreditor Agreement authorized to release Transaction Security over that asset and where the asset consists of shares in a Group company, Transaction Guarantee and Transaction Security granted by such company. Although the Transaction Security shall be released pro rata between the Secured Parties and continue to rank pari passu between the Secured Parties, such release will impair the security interest and the secured position of the Noteholders.
The Terms and Conditions of the Notes provide that the Noteholders' Agent shall in certain circumstances agreed therein, take actions necessary to release the Transaction Guarantees and Transaction Security or part thereof.
The Noteholders' Agent shall also take actions necessary to release all Transaction Guarantees and/or Transaction Security if (a) the Secured Parties representing at least 66.67 percent of the Secured Obligations agree to release all of the Transaction Security and/or the Transaction Guarantees; or (b) upon the Issuer reaching the Investment Grade Status, the Secured Parties representing at least 50 percent of the Secured Obligations agree to release all of the Transaction Security and/or the Transaction Guarantees; or (c) the Secured Obligations (other than in respect of the Notes or other senior notes issued by the Issuer and benefiting from the Transaction Security and/or the Transaction Guarantees) have been refinanced, are agreed to be amended to
66

continue or pursuant to their terms and conditions may or shall continue on an unsecured and/or unguaranteed basis, in each case further provided that all of the Transaction Security and/or the Transaction Guarantees when released are released with respect to all Secured Obligations (including other secured notes) simultaneously.
The Noteholders' Agent shall take actions necessary to release a part of Transaction Guarantees and/or Transaction Security if (a) the Secured Parties representing at least 66.67 percent of the Secured Obligations agree to release such part of the Transaction Security and/or the Transaction Guarantees; or (b) upon the Issuer reaching the Investment Grade Status, the Secured Parties representing at least 50 percent of the Secured Obligations agree to release such part of the Transaction Security and/or the Transaction Guarantees; or (c) assets subject to such part of the Transaction Security are sold, transferred or otherwise disposed to another member of the Group and such assets become covered by Transaction Security provided by such recipient member of the Group or corresponding new Transaction Security is granted by such recipient member of the Group; or (d) the provider of Transaction Security (other than the Issuer) is to cease to exist as result of a merger, demerger, corporate reorganisation or solvent liquidation not prohibited under the Terms and Conditions, in each case further provided that such part of the Transaction Security and/or the Transaction Guarantees when released is released with respect to all Secured Obligations (including other secured notes) simultaneously.
After any such release, depending on the scope of the release, the Noteholders may become unsecured and unguaranteed and lose priority in case of foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, recapitalisation, administrative or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings of any member of the Group.
Please see "Additional information on the Transaction Guarantees, Transaction Security and Intercreditor Agreement".
Rights in the Transaction Security m ay be adversely affected by thefailu re to perfect the Transaction Security
Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured creditor or the security provider. The Transaction Security may not be perfected if the Security Agent or the relevant security provider is not able to or does not take the actions necessary to perfect or maintain the perfection of any such security. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant Transaction Security or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Transaction Security. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will monitor, or that Outokumpu will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Transaction Security, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after acquired collateral. The Security Agent has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that is purported to be covered by the Transaction Security or the perfection of any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the Transaction Security or adversely affect the priority of the security interest in favor of the Secured Parties against third parties including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who may claim Transaction Security.
Certain liabilities have priority to the proceeds fro m the enforcem ent o f Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees and paym ents in a distressed situation
The proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees as well as in a distressed situation any payments under the receivables covered by the Intercreditor Agreement are pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement subject to the waterfall set out therein. The waterfall provides for a priority before the Notes to certain liabilities owed to the Security Agent and certain enforcement costs of the Secured Parties. The priority in the waterfall for certain other liabilities will decrease the benefit of the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees and in general payments available to be shared by the Noteholders and accordingly the proportional share available to the Noteholders.

CREDIT RATINGS
The Notes have been assigned a credit rating of `B2' by the international credit rating agency Moody's. The Issuer has a corporate family rating (CFR) of B3 and B3-PD probability default rating (PDR) from Moody's. The rating report on the Issuer was issued by Moody's on March 29, 2016.
The `corporate family rating (CFR)' by Moody's is a long-term rating that reflects the relative likelyhood of a default on a corporate family's debt and debt-like obligations and the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Obligations rated `B3' by Moody's are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk and ranks in the lower end of the category. The `probability default rating (PDR)' by Moody's is a corporate family-level opinion of the relative likelihood that any entity within a corporate family will default on one or more of its long-term debt obligations, and `B3-PD' rating by Moody's means that rated corporate family is considered speculative and are subject to high default risk.`B2 rating' by Moody's is one notch above B3 rating and means that the obligations rated are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk but are ranked in the mid-range of the category.
Moody's is established in the European Union and is registered under Regulation (EC) No. 1060/2009 (as amended).

On February 28, 2014, Outokumpu, certain subsidiaries of Outokumpu, the lenders under the Revolving Facility, the lenders under the EUR 500 million secured syndicated loan facility between Outokumpu and a group of banks to support the medium-term liquidity requirements of Outokumpu, subsequently cancelled in full (the "Liquidity Facility"), the lenders under the Amended Facilities and the agent of the holders of the 2015 Notes and the 2016 Notes (for and on behalf of the holders of the 2015 Notes and the 2016 Notes which notes have subsequently been repaid in full), among others, entered into an agreement to, among other things, regulate the ranking and enforcement of the Transaction Security and of the guarantees granted therein (the "Intercreditor Agreement"). The Intercreditor Agreement contains a procedure by which new financings can be taken subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and to benefit from the Transaction Guarantees and Transaction Security. Prior to the Issue Date, the Noteholders' Agent has for and on behalf of the holders of the Notes acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer has designated the Notes as additional senior financing for the purposes of the Intercreditor and an English law confirmation as well as German and Italian law security documentation have been executed by the Guarantors and the Security Providers on or about the Issue Date so as to ensure that also the holders of the Notes benefit from the Transaction Guarantees and the Transaction Security. In connection with the issue of the 2019 Notes similar actions were taken including the agent of the holders of the 2019 Notes acceding to the Intercreditor Agreement (for an on behalf of the holders of the 2019 Notes).
Ranking o f debt and Transaction Security and priority to enforcem entproceeds
The Intercreditor Agreement subordinates intra-Group loan liabilities to the Secured Obligations. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, all the liabilities secured by the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees shall rank in right and priority of payment, and the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees shall secure such liabilities, pari passu and pro rata without any preference between them, except for certain liabilities that have priority to the enforcement proceeds from the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement the Transaction Guarantee and Transaction Security proceeds are subject to the waterfall set out in the Intercreditor Agreement providing for a priority before the Notes for liabilities owed to the Security Agent (or any receiver or delegate) and certain enforcement costs incurred by the Secured Parties, in this order. The beforementioned priority of payments applies also to all payments under the Secured Obligations in a distressed situation.
The pro rata and pari passu ranking is however limited in respect of a creditor whose claim has been subordinated due to the creditor being a related party to a Group member that is subject to an insolvency proceeding.
Security Agent
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement the Secured Parties have appointed the Security Agent to act as trustee, agent and representative and to hold the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees on trust for itself and the Secured Parties. The Transaction Security is and will be held, administered and enforced, and the Transaction Security Documents have been and will be executed, by the Security Agent for and on behalf of all the Secured Parties in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. At the date of this Prospectus, the Security Agent is The Law Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c..
The Intercreditor Agreement contains an indemnity by each Secured Party for the benefit of the Security Agent (and receiver and delegate) for costs, losses and liabilities incurred by any of them (other than as a result of their gross negligence or willful default) in acting as security agent, receiver or delegate under the Secured Obligations.
122

Creditor groups and voting
The Secured Parties are pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement divided into creditor groups entitling each group to only one vote with all credit participations pertaining to such group (calculated on the basis of commitments, where applicable). The groups are formed from the creditors under the different facilities as follows: Revolving facility as well as each syndicated facility, bilateral lender and additional senior financing forming their own group. Within the groups the decision making follows the terms and conditions of the relevant financing.
The decisive thresholds in decision making under the Intercreditor Agreement are 66 2/3 percent of the senior credit participations forming majority senior creditors and 50 percent of the senior credit participations forming an instructing group.
Perm itted payments and enforcement
Secured Obligations may be paid in accordance with their terms until an acceleration event occurs or any Transaction Security is being enforced. Thereafter the waterfall referred to above applies. Although intra-Group liabilities are subordinated, payments for such liabilities are generally permitted when due except when an event of default is outstanding and the Security Agent has prohibited such payment.
The Secured Parties are restricted from taking enforcement action (including the Noteholders taking enforcement actions in respect of the Notes) without a majority creditor consent but with the following exceptions:
(a) in insolvency proceedings to take enforcement action (other than in respect of enforcement of Transaction Security or entering into any compromise with the Issuer or any Guarantor being the subject of the insolvency proceeding);
(b) to make a claim in the winding-up, dissolution, administration, reorganization or similar insolvency event of a debtor for liabilities owed to the relevant Secured Party;
(c) following the occurrence of an event of default acceleration of the Notes or other Secured Obligations owed to the Noteholders or the Noteholders' Agent in accordance with the Terms and Conditions; and
(d) suing for, commencing or joining any legal or arbitration proceedings against the Issuer or any provider of Transaction Security or Transaction Guarantee to recover the Secured Obligations owed to the Noteholders or the Noteholders' Agent in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
Enforcement of Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees is pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement permitted only through the Security Agent and on instructing group instructions. Each creditor is obliged to vote in any official insolvency or rehabilitation proceeding relating to a group company as instructed by the Security Agent.
In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement sets out the enforcement mechanics for the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees, including, among other things, enforcement trigger events pursuant to which the Transaction Security may become enforceable, provisions regarding non-cash recoveries, certain consultation obligations for the different creditor groups and other similar limitations and conditions.
Turnover
Any amount received by a Secured Party contrary to the Intercreditor Agreement, by way of set-off, after the occurrence of a distress event, as a result of any litigation or proceedings (other than insolvency) or proceeds of any enforcement of Transaction Security or Transaction Guarantees not distributed in accordance with the waterfall, is (or cash-value of a non-cash receipt) required to be promptly paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. Any such amounts are subject to sharing provisions that apply among Secured Parties.
123

Release of Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees
The Security Agent is pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement entitled on behalf of all Secured Parties to release any part of the Transaction Security in certain circumstances subject to and in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. The Security Agent is authorized to release relevant part of the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees and to discharge Secured Obligations and certain intra-group liabilities in order to facilitate enforcement of Transaction Security or a distressed disposal or appropriation made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that in connection with a disposal of an asset by a member of the Group permitted under the terms of the secured financing under non-distressed circumstances, the Security Agent is under the Intercreditor Agreement authorized to release Transaction Security over that asset and where the asset consists of shares in a Group company, Transaction Guarantee and Transaction Security granted by such company. The Intercreditor Agreement obliges each Secured Party to take actions necessary to effect such releases and discharges for non-distressed disposals and distressed disposals and appropriation.
Application o f disposal and capital markets proceeds
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the net proceeds from any disposals or the issuance of capital markets instruments (excluding debt capital markets instruments resulting in proceeds of EUR 10 million or less) must first be applied towards prepayment and cancellation of the Liquidity Facility and second, on a pro rata and pari passu basis to the Revolving Facility and other secured creditors (to the extent that the relevant secured creditor has a prepayment right under the terms of the relevant loan facility). The Liquidity Facility has been cancelled in full.
Changes to the parties
The Intercreditor Agreement contains mechanisms for further creditors, guarantors and intra-group lenders acceding thereto. By acceding to the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with its terms further creditors may become Secured Parties benefiting from the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees, further guarantors would constitute additional Transaction Guarantees for all Secured Obligations and further intre-group lenders would result in further intra-group debt being subordinated to the Secured Obligations.
Perm itted amendments
The Intercreditor Agreement contains various conditions on the requirements for effecting amendments to the terms thereof. Amendments that shorten contractually scheduled maturity or redemption date, amortization profile or reduces average weighted life of a facility or introduces scheduled reductions in available commitments, require consent of the majority senior creditors. The Intercreditor Agreement entirely restricts amendments that conflict with the Intercreditor Agreement or create a default under another debt document with respect to any action or event that is permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. Also, where an amendment to the Transaction Security relates to the nature or scope of the collateral assets, the manner in which enforcement proceeds are distributed or to the release of Transaction Security, such amendments may only be made with the consent of each creditor group representative.
Am endm ent and replacem ent o f the Intercreditor Agreem ent, Transaction Security and Transaction G u aran tees
In consideration of the maturity of the Notes and the maturity of the other Secured Obligations, it is possible that in connection with a refinancing of certain of such other Secured Obligations, the Intercreditor Agreement will be replaced by a new intercreditor agreement and the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees will be released and re-granted. Pursuant to the Terms and Conditions, the Noteholders' Agent is authorized to take actions needed for the amendment and replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement and the release and, where applicable, the retake of the Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees provided that from the perspective of the Noteholders the ranking among the external debt covered by the new intercreditor and the application of proceeds from any security and guarantees is not less beneficial than under the Intercreditor Agreement and that any Transaction Security and Transaction Guarantees benefit the Notes alike the other Secured Obligations.

The following chart sets forth Outokumpu's organization as at the date of this Prospectus:
History Outokumpu was founded in 1910 to exploit rich copper ore deposits in the town of Outokumpu in eastern Finland. Following the incorporation of Outokumpu as a wholly state-owned company in 1932, Outokumpu established itself over the next two decades as a strong copper producer and expanded its operations to cover a range of activities from exploration and mining to smelting and refining as well as the fabrication of copper products. A notable achievement was the development of the Outokumpu flash-smelting process in the late 1940s, which became an industry standard. With new ore discoveries and the development of innovative technologies, Outokumpu moved into a new expansion and diversification stage in the mid-1950s. Outokumpu built up its mining and metals processing operations in Finland to include nickel, zinc, chromite, ferrochrome and, ultimately, in the mid-1970s, stainless steel. The 1980s marked a period of rapid international expansion for Outokumpu. This was prompted by the need to replace Outokumpu's depleting domestic raw material base and to strengthen its competitive position. To achieve these objectives, Outokumpu started new mine projects in Europe, the Americas and Australia and made a number of acquisitions, notably within the copper products business area and technology sales. As a result, by the mid-1990s, Outokumpu had developed into a diversified global metals group. During the mid-1990s, Outokumpu established stainless steel production as its core business and shifted its focus from mining to value-added metals production. In 1999, it embarked on a major investment program to expand its stainless steel mill in Tornio, including the construction of a new cold rolling facility that opened in 2003. Between 1990 and 2000, Outokumpu divested most of its base metals mining operations and made a number of investments in additional capacity and in companies complementing its technology base and expanding its product offering. In particular, Outokumpu made significant investments in fabricated copper production and metals technology companies, and nearly doubled its zinc business in 2001 with the acquisition of Norzink and expansion of its Kokkola zinc plant. In January 2001, Outokumpu combined its stainless steel operations with Avesta Sheffield to form a new company, AvestaPolarit and, in 2002, Outokumpu acquired full ownership of AvestaPolarit.
134

Outokumpu sold its copper and zinc mining and smelting operations in 2003 and a major part of its copper products business in 2005. In 2006, Outokumpu consolidated its technology expertise into a new business, Outokumpu Technology, which was sold and listed as an independent company on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and subsequently changed its name to Outotec Oyj. The remainder of Outokumpu's copper products business was sold in 2008.
In 2012, Outokumpu acquired all shares from both Inoxum GmbH and ThyssenKrupp Nirosta GmbH, the parent companies of the group comprising the stainless steel business of ThyssenKrupp (the "Inoxum Acquisition").
In 2015, to follow its strategy to differentiate from the competition in China and the Asia-Pasific region with specialty grades and tailored solutions, Outokumpu announced to divest its shares in SKS in China. In 2015, Outokumpu also divested its share in joint venture Fischer Mexicana in Mexico.
Investments, Divestments and Other Recent Events
O verview
Since the merger with Inoxum at the end of 2012, Outokumpu has implemented significant profitability improvement programs to restructure the Company's asset base, reduce costs and improve efficiencies. Two of these programs, Synergies and P250, were closed at the end of 2015 following the achievement of the targeted savings. Likewise, the P400 program which aimed at releasing EUR 400 million of cash from net working capital, was completed at the end of 2015.
Cumulative savings from the ongoing restructuring program in Europe amounted to EUR 20 million by the end of 2015 and additional EUR 15 million was reached at the end of the first quarter of 2016 bringing to total savings of EUR 35 million since the beginning of the program. The majority of the restructuring savings came from the Bochum melt shop closure at the end of June 2015. The next milestones will be the Benrath site closure in 2016 and the completion of the investment in ferritic stainless steel capacity in Krefeld by 2017. Total additional savings of EUR 45 million are expected for 2016, with the full cumulative savings of EUR 100 million by the end of 2017.
Outokumpu took decisive steps to strengthen its financial stability and balance sheet towards the end of the 2015 by completing two divestments: the sale of 60 percent in Shanghai Krupp Stainless Co., Ltd. (SKS) and 50 percent in Fischer Mexicana.
D ivestm ent o f SK S Joint Venture
Following its strategy to differentiate in the APAC region with specialty grades and tailored solutions, Outokumpu decided to divest its shareholding in SKS in China. SKS was a joint venture between Outokumpu (60 percent) and Baosteel (40 percent), operating a cold rolling mill in Shanghai with over 450 employees. SKS focused on the most common stainless steel grades and business had been under severe pressure over the past years.
On December 10, 2015, Outokumpu completed the divestment of 55 percent of shares in SKS in China to Lujiazui International Trust Co., Ltd. ("LTC") in China. On February 2, 2016, Outokumpu announced that it has agreed with LTC on a Put-and-Call-Option upon which LTC is entitled to acquire and Outokumpu is entitled to sell its remaining 5 percent in SKS. In parallel, the Board of Directors of SKS made a decision to stop the operations of SKS due to ongoing losses and extreme pressure in commodity stainless steel products in China. The final terms and conditions regarding the sale of the 5 percent share were agreed in May 2016. The final transaction price for Outokumpu's 5 percent rises to EUR 90 million from the earlier estimated EUR 62 million, taking into account all adjustments. Outokumpu will book additional capital gain of EUR 23 million net of taxes into its second quarter results. The gain will be excluded from the underlying profitability. In total, Outokumpu has now recorded a capital gain of EUR 412 million net of taxes for the sale of its entire 60 percent share in SKS. According to the agreement, LTC will pay the final payment in three installments. The closing of the transaction is expected during the fourth quarter of 2016 after receiving the final installment. Until then, Outokumpu remains a minority shareholder with a 5 percent share in SKS.
135

The divestment of SKS enabled significant debt reduction and extension of the credit facilities and balancing of the debt maturity profile. Please see section Refinancing and repaym ent o f debt"below.
D ivestm ent o f Fischer M exicana Joint Venture
On December 15, 2015, Outokumpu completed the divestment of its stake in Fischer Mexicana S.A. DE C.V. ("Fischer Mexicana"), a joint venture between F.E.R. Fischer Edelstahlrohre GmbH and Outokumpu in Mexico. In the transaction, Outokumpu divested its 50 percent stake in the joint venture for EUR 57 million.
For more information on new profitability improvement measure, please see section "Information about the Issuer- Business Strategy - Short term measures ".
Europe Restructuring
Outokumpu is implementing structural changes in its European operations aimed at improving financial performance and efficiency. One of the main targets of the restructuring is to improve capacity utilization in Europe through the concentration of melting activities in the Tornio and Avesta production facilities and the reduction of cold rolling capacity in Germany through the transfer of its cold rolling production in Benrath to Outokumpu's Krefeld production facility. Following the Bochum melt shop closure at the end of June 2015, melting has been transferred to Tornio and Avesta and cold rolling in Germany is concentrated in Krefeld and Dillenburg. The next milestones will be the Benrath site closure in 2016 and the completion of the investment in ferritic stainless steel capacity in Krefeld by 2017. An additional savings of EUR 60 million are expected for 2016, with the full cumulative savings of EUR 100 million by the end of 2017.
Refinancing and repaym ent o f debt
The divestment of SKS enabled significant debt reduction and extension of the credit facilities and balancing of the debt maturity profile. To reduce debt levels and to improve Outokumpu's financial position, Outokumpu announced on December 14, 2015 that it had prepaid and cancelled EUR 100 million of its EUR 900 million revolving credit facility and signed an amendment and extension agreement relating to the remaining EUR 800 million. The amended facility includes a new EUR 655 million tranche which matures in February 2019 and the remaining EUR 145 million will mature in February 2017. BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Danske Bank, Nordea, Pohjola Bank, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Svenska Handelsbanken and Swedbank act as lenders in the extended tranche. The syndicated revolving credit facility includes two financial covenants, one based on gearing and the other on liquidity. In addition, Outokumpu cancelled and prepaid some EUR 240 million of its bilateral loans, including pension loans, and extended two bilateral facilities in the aggregate amount of EUR 120 million to February 2019. With these financing transactions, Outokumpu's annual financing costs are estimated to decrease by some EUR 20 million.
The key credit facilities of Outokumpu continue as at the date of this Prospectus to be covered by the same security package that was created in 2014 in connection with the entering into the original EUR 900 million revolving credit facility and other refinancing and extension measures. As security, Outokumpu has pledged the shares of some of its subsidiary companies, incorporated for example in Finland, Sweden and the United States, as well as certain fixed assets. In addition, guarantees have been provided by certain subsidiary companies for such debt financing. For further information about on the secured credit facilities, guarantees and security, please see section "A dditional Information on the Transaction Guarantees, Transaction Security and Intercreditor A greem ent".
In vestm en ts
Except as described in this section "Investments'"' and in section "R isk F actors- Outokumpu faces risks associated with nuclear p o w er p lan t projects in F in la n d ' above, there are no commitments made for future principal investments after the financial statements 2015 since Outokumpu seeks to keep future capital expenditure levels low and its assets base is well invested. The guided capital expenditure level for 2016 is approximately EUR 140 million, out of which capital expenditure for maintenance is estimated to be about EUR 70 to 80 million. There are two exceptions.
136

First exception is the so-called NIFO project (Nirosta Ferritics Optimization) to expand ferritic capabilities in Germany. Under the project the Benrath site will be closed, and overall cold rolling capacity will be reduced by approximately 250,000 tonnes. One hot annealing and pickling line (HAPL) and cold annealing and pickling line (CAPL) at Krefeld was stopped by June 1, 2014. Lines will be redesigned to a new 1.600 mm bright annealing line and pickling line. Capital expenditure for the entire project has been estimated at EUR 108 million in 2014 2016 to enable the transfer. EUR 71 million had been spent by the end of March 2016. The investment costs related to the NIFO project are included in the planned capital expenditure and will be financed through centrally arranged corporate financing as well as cash from operations.
Second exception is that Outokumpu announced on August 5, 2015 that it has decided to increase its share in the Fennovoima nuclear plant project by 1.8 percentage points. Thus, Outokumpu's share in the planned nuclear power plant increases to approximately 14 percent. Annual capital expenditure related to the project is expected to be around EUR 10-20 million in the coming years, and approximately half of the investment is expected to be paid only at the end of the construction phase in 2022-2023. Outokumpu is liable for Fennovoima's operating costs in proportion to its share of ownership. The investment costs related to the Fennovoima nuclear plant project are included in the planned capital expenditure and will be financed through centrally arranged corporate financing as well as cash from operations.
Outokumpu is currently assessing feasibility of a significant investment in Kemi chromite mine, objective of which is to build a new mining level at a depth of one kilometer in order to secure the mine's production operations well beyond year 2021. Investment planning and building of exploration capabilities at the level of 900 meters is currently ongoing.
Other recent events
Outokumpu announced on May 13, 2016 that the Board of Directors of Outokumpu has decided to utilize the authorization given by the Annual General Meeting held on April 6, 2016 to repurchase the Company's own shares. The maximum number of shares to be repurchased in one or more instalments is 2,000,000 corresponding to about 0.48 percent of the total number of the Company's shares. The shares are to be repurchased using the Company's unrestricted equity through public trading on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. The price for the shares will be based on the price prevailing on the market on the day of the repurchase in public trading. As at the date of this Prospectus the Company has announced three share repurchases based on the Board decision.
Key Strengths
Outokumpu believes that the following are among its key strengths:
Leading Stainless Steel Producer with Strong Footprint in Both Europe and Am ericas, and Leading T echnical Know-how E nabling D ifferentiation in A sia
Outokumpu has a global network consisting of 18 production sites, a chromite mine, three ferrochrome smelters, 19 stainless steel service centers and more than 50 sales offices and sales agents. Outokumpu's main production facilities are located in Europe and North America. These production facilities together with its global distribution network give Outokumpu a good position in the key stainless steel consuming regions, Europe and Americas whereas in Asia Outokumpu differentiates itself from competition with leading technical knowhow in stainless steel. Local presence and production is especially important in the standard stainless steel market and Outokumpu believes that its stainless steel production capacity in the key geographic markets is a significant competitive advantage. Outokumpu also has specialty stainless production facilities in Europe and North America, which serve clients on a global basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Outokumpu generated 65 percent of its sales from Europe, 21 percent from North America, 12 percent from Asia and Oceania and 2 percent from other countries.
Outokumpu is the leading stainless steel producer in Europe based on its approximately 30 percent share of stainless steel cold rolled deliveries to Europe in 2015 (source: EUROFER, January 2016). Outokumpu serves the European stainless steel market through its extensive sales and distribution network with key production facilities in Tornio, Finland, Avesta and Degerfors, Sweden as well as its cold rolling facilities in Germany, which is the largest European stainless steel market (source: SMR, April 2016). Outokumpu's production facilities in Germany include cold rolling facilities producing ferritic and austenitic grades and a precision strip
137

production facility. In addition, Outokumpu's European presence also covers long product production facilities in Sweden and the United Kingdom. Based on its leading market share and local production facilities, Outokumpu believes that it is well positioned to benefit from the forecast annual growth of 1.5 percent (CAGR) in European stainless steel consumption between 2016 and 2019 (source: SMR, May 2016).
Outokumpu has a strong market position in North America, where it had approximately a 21 percent market share of cold rolled deliveries in NAFTA in 2015 (source: AISI, February 2016). In the Americas, Outokumpu serves its customers through its Calvert integrated production facility in the United States, and its cold rolling facility in Mexico. Also in the United States, Outokumpu is operating speciality stainless steel production capacities for quarto plate products and long products. Outokumpu believes that its increased production capacity will provide opportunities to further increase its market share after the completion of the Calvert rampup and that it is well positioned to benefit from the forecasted annual growth of 1.5 percent (CAGR) in stainless steel demand in NAFTA between 2016 and 2019 (source: SMR, May 2016).
World-class A ssets Including Efficient Integrated Production Facilities in Finland and the United States as well as Captive Ferrochrom e Production
Located in northern Finland, Tornio is the largest single site stainless steel production facility in Europe in terms of cold rolling capacity (source: CRU, February 2016). The Tornio integrated production facility consists of two state-of-the-art melt shops, hot and cold rolling facilities and finishing facilities, and is the only stainless steel production facility in the world with its own chromite mine and ferrochrome production facilities. In particular, the Tornio integrated production facility's unique rolling, annealing and pickling ("RAP") line produces higher margin flat products with a 2E finish, which feature minimum thickness tolerances, high surface quality and corrosion resistance as well as high mechanical uniformity. The Tornio integrated production facility is one of the most cost-efficient stainless steel production facilities in Europe, measured by the unit production cost per tonne for cold rolled 304 austenitic stainless steel grades (source: SMR, December 2014). The industrial restructuring of Outokumpu's operations in Europe has enabled Outokumpu to use the Tornio integrated production facility more efficiently and with a better capacity utilization rate.
The Calvert integrated production facility in the United States, of which technical ramp-up was completed in 2014 and is expected to achieve steady-state operations in 2018, is expected to have one of the lowest production costs per unit among the major stainless steel production facilities in North America. Calvert benefits from an industrial setup designed to maximize efficiency and the latest stainless steel production equipment technology, including the only 72-inch wide coil production capability in NAFTA. Calvert also benefits from its location near recycled stainless steel suppliers, long-term energy supply contracts and competitive labor costs. The rampup of the Calvert production facility will expand Outokumpu's portfolio of products produced in NAFTA. It will also reduce Outokumpu's costs as hot rolled products for its Mexican cold rolling facility will be sourced from Calvert instead of Outokumpu's European production facilities, reducing transportation costs and lead times.
Outokumpu produces ferrochrome using chromite mined from its mine in Kemi, Finland. Outokumpu's ferrochrome production facility is located in Finland, where it has access to sufficient electricity and is on the same site as Outokumpu's Tornio integrated production facility. Tornio's own chromite mine and ferrochrome production facilities contribute significantly to the low unit production costs, primarily through reduced transportation and energy costs for ferrochrome. The Kemi mine is the only operating chromite mine in the EU and its close proximity to Tornio significantly reduces Outokumpu's transportation costs. As Outokumpu's ferrochrome production facility is located next to Tornio, molten ferrochrome, the product of ferrochrome smelting, can be transferred to and used in the melt shop in the molten state, which provides significant energy savings as the ferrochrome does not need to be re-melted, nor does it need to be cooled and crushed for transportation. Outokumpu's ability to source ferrochrome internally and at the cost of production mitigates the impact of ferrochrome price volatility on Outokumpu's sourcing and production costs.
Outokumpu's approximately EUR 410 million investment program to double its annual ferrochrome production capacity to 530,000 tonnes as well as increase the production capacity of its Kemi chromite mine was finalized in 2012. After the successful completion of the ramp-up, Outokumpu is self-sufficient for the entire group's ferrochrome needs. Nevertheless, Outokumpu aims to continue to sell and purchase certain amounts and types of ferrochrome from third parties to optimize its raw materials usage. Outokumpu expects that the increased capacity will allow it to maintain cost competitiveness in ferrochrome production and position Outokumpu as a competitive and reliable ferrochrome supplier for both internally and to external customers.

Outokumpu attempts to optimize the use of recycled steel as a source of alloys in its production process. Certain alloying elements used in stainless steel, such as nickel, chromium and molybdenum, are often cheaper when purchased as a component of recycled stainless steel than in pure form, depending on market prices. Outokumpu has increased the use of recycled stainless in its production in recent years and, due to the scale of its operations and purchase volumes, has been able to purchase recycled stainless steel at a cost that has allowed it to better compete against Asian imports using nickel pig iron and obtain better margins for its products.
Strong Product Portfolio Covering Stainless Steel and Leading Product Quality
Outokumpu has a broad product offering with large-scale production capabilities for stainless steel products and a strong focus on higher value-added specialty stainless steel products and grades. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 72 percent of Outokumpu's external stainless steel deliveries by volume were austenitic stainless steel grades, approximately 21 percent were ferritic stainless steel grades, approximately 4 percent were duplex stainless steel grades, and approximately 3 percent were other stainless steel grades.
Outokumpu's stainless steel product offering includes austenitic and ferritic stainless steel grades. Austenitic stainless steel grades are the most common type of stainless steel and contain both chromium and nickel. Austenitic stainless steel grades are used in a variety of applications, including kitchenware, domestic appliances, equipment for process industries, vessels and piping, containers, architectural facades and construction (e.g., for bridges).
Outokumpu is on of the leading producers of ferritic stainless steel grades in Europe based on delivery volumes (source: EUROFER, April 2016). Ferritic stainless steel grades contain chromium and do not contain nickel. As nickel prices are highly volatile, sales of ferritic grades, which do not contain nickel, reduce Outokumpu's exposure to nickel price volatility and increase earnings visibility. Applications for ferritic grades include structural applications, kitchenware, boilers, white goods, indoor architecture and automobile exhaust systems. Outokumpu's product offering in ferritic grades as well as its experience in research and development, position it to benefit from end users moving from austenitic to ferritic grades for applications where the properties of ferritic stainless steel grades are sufficient, allowing end users to benefit from lower and more stable prices.
Outokumpu is the leading producer of duplex stainless steel grades globally in terms of market share and is the leading producer of duplex stainless steel grades in Europe in terms of market share (source: SMR, May 2016). In the past, duplex stainless steel grades have contributed to Outokumpu's profitability as duplex grades generally generate higher margins than general stainless steel grades since the production of duplex grades requires greater technical skill and precision. In addition, duplex stainless steel grades generally have a lower overall cost for end users as compared to most austenitic and ferritic grades as a result of the superior strength of duplex grades, which reduces the amount of material required, and the superior corrosion resistance of duplex grades, which reduces maintenance costs and increases the useful lifespan of the end product.
Outokumpu's stainless steel product offering in austenitic, ferritic, duplex and other special grades includes coil and sheet, thin strip, quarto plate, pipes, long products and semi-finished products. These products are produced in a variety of stainless steel grades, dimensions and surface finishes, and can be further processed by Outokumpu's coil and plate service centers.
In addition to its broad product portfolio, Outokumpu believes that the high quality of its products provides it with a competitive advantage over some of its competitors. The primary factors that stainless steel customers consider when selecting a supplier include delivery reliability, product quality and competitive pricing. Customers also consider the technical expertise of the supplier and the customer experiences. In particular, in industries such as medical, automotive, architecture and chemical, petrochemical and energy, where the quality of the product is highly important for the end customer, the reputation and references of the producer are often important factors when selecting a stainless steel supplier.
Established and Balanced Customer Base Across all Key M arkets
Outokumpu's customer base is balanced geographically with manufacturing presence in both Europe and North America. Geographic distribution of its operations balances the impact of changes in demand in different markets on Outokumpu results of operations and also allows Outokumpu to serve large, global customers worldwide. In addition, Outokumpu's stainless steel end user customer base is diverse and includes clients from
139

consumer goods and medical industries, automotive industry, architecture, building and construction industries, heavy industries, metal processing industries as well as other segments. As a result, Outokumpu's customer exposure is well balanced and includes both consumer and industrial driven segments that generally present favorable growth outlooks.
Outokumpu's business area Long Products sells a high portion of their products to end users. The dominating end use industries in their markets are chemicals and energy, heavy industry as well as building and construction. Outokumpu believes that its significant exposure to potential growth in the capital goods serving sectors and process and resources industries provides it with an advantage over its European competitors. For more information, see "-- Business Overview-Customers" below.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 56 percent of Outokumpu's sales were directly to end users and the remaining approximately 44 percent were to distributors and processors. Having a balanced profile allows Outokumpu to benefit from generally higher margins obtained through direct sales and reduces Outokumpu's exposure to cyclical buying patterns of distributors. Due to its direct sales and extensive product portfolio that includes special grades, Outokumpu is also less affected by imports into Europe.

Business Strategy
Vision 2020 and M easures to D rive Competitiveness
In April 2016, Outokumpu announced its new vision and measures to drive competitiveness and further improve the financial performance of the Company. The new vision has been defined as: to be the best value creator in stainless steel by 2020 through customer orientation and efficiency. Simultaneously, Outokumpu outlined its long-term financial targets connected to this vision.
Outokumpu will focus on the following six areas to reach its vision:
· Safety: a standardized and disciplined approach to safety that correlates with improved quality and operational efficiency, leading to a top decile position in the industry;
· High performing organization: a lean, simple and flat organization that takes its lead from market trends and requirements, and drives a high level of individual accountability that is enforced through vigorous performance management;
· Word-class supply chain: the role of the supply chain function elevated to drive optimal matching of market demand and the manufacturing capabilities, managing manufacturing programming and planning as well as the required resources and logistics. This will allow the Company's production units to focus on achieving a benchmark level in cost efficiency;
· Manufacturing excellence: implementing a standardized operating model to ensure continuous productivity gains in all the mills across the Company, leading to industry benchmark competitiveness;
· Americas: the single biggest profitability improvement lever for Outokumpu, with significant improvement potential in both cost and market position; and
· Portfolio: continuous review of product portfolio, assets and operations to maximize the profitability of the business and minimize complexity.
While work has started in all areas, reaching the full potential and run rate impact is expected to take some years triggering the need for a set of immediate measures to deliver a step change in the Company cost and competitive position.
Short-term Actions
· New organizational set-up: a simplified organization with three business areas, less management layers and a lighter cost structure;
· A reduction of EUR 100 million in sales, general and administrative costs (SG&A) by the end of 2017 against the baseline of EUR 400 million at the end of 2015; and
· A cash release of at least EUR 200 million from net working capital by the end of 2016, particularly through the reduction of inventory carry.
Outokumpu considers gearing (debt-to-equity ratio) to be a relevant key indicator for the health of the Company in the cyclical stainless steel sector. Outokumpu is targeting to reduce its net debt to EUR 1.2 billion by the end of 2017, driven mainly by the expected improvement in operational performance as well as a significant uplift in net working capital efficiency.
141

Long-term Financial Targets In connection with the new vision, Outokumpu has defined long-term financial targets to reflect the progress of its strategic initiatives and the development in profitability and further deleveraging:
· EBIT of EUR 500 million; · ROCE of 12 percent; and · Gearing of less than 35 percent These group-level targets are expected by the Company to be reached by the end of 2020 at the latest. While the global demand for stainless steel continues to grow, Outokumpu takes a conservative approach on the market growth and metal price assumptions, and expects the targeted profitability improvement to come primarily through efficiency and cost improvements in the current scope of business, supported by further strengthening of Outokumpu's cost competitiveness and market position particularly in the Americas.

INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW
Stainless Steel
Stainless steel is a versatile and widely used material that plays a key role in many important areas, including urbanization; transportation; and the production and consumption of food, water and other beverages, and energy. Stainless steel's attractive properties, which include corrosion resistance, high strength-to-weight ratio, heat tolerance, aesthetic qualities and the ability to be recycled, have contributed to the increased use of stainless steel in new and existing applications.
Stainless steel differs from carbon steel by the chromium content: stainless steel contains a minimum of 10.5 percent chromium. One of the most important properties of stainless steel is corrosion resistance, which results from a thin layer of chromium oxide which forms on its surface in the presence of oxygen. The chromium oxide layer acts as a barrier between the stainless steel and its surroundings and is impermeable, insoluble and self repairing in the presence of oxygen, whereas unprotected carbon steel rusts when exposed to air and moisture. In addition to chromium, typical alloying elements in stainless steel include nickel, molybdenum and nitrogen. In 2015, total global steel production was 1.6 billion tonnes, of which approximately 2.6 percent was stainless steel (source: World Steel Association; SMR, February 2016). Outokumpu operates in the stainless steel business and is not involved in carbon steel business.
Stainless steels are divided by their crystalline structure into four major types:
· Austenitic stainless steel grades contain both chromium and nickel and have a low carbon content, with the most commonly used grade containing 18 percent chromium and eight percent nickel. Austenitic grades are resistant to corrosion, hygienic and easy to weld and form. Along with good high and low temperature properties, austenitic grades are non-magnetic (if annealed) and can only be hardened by cold working. Austenitic stainless steel grades are used to make a variety of products including kitchenware, domestic appliances, equipment for process industries, vessels and piping, containers, architectural facades and construction (e.g., for bridges). Molybdenum-alloyed austenitic grades, also called moly grades, are used where better corrosion resistance is needed, especially in the chemical and process industry. Austenitic stainless steel grades are the most common type of stainless steel. In 2015, standard and specialty austenitic stainless steel grades accounted for approximately 72 percent of Outokumpu's external stainless steel deliveries.
· Ferritic stainless steel grades usually contain no nickel, have a chromium content between 11 and 20 percent and a low carbon content. Ferritic grades are magnetic, have moderate to good corrosion resistance and cannot be hardened by heat treatment. Ferritic grades have properties similar to carbon steel, but have better corrosion resistance. The most common ferritic grades contain either 12 or 17 percent chromium, with 12 percent used mostly in structural applications and 17 percent used mostly in kitchenware, boilers, white goods and indoor architecture. The ferritic grade containing 11 percent chromium and stabilized by titanium is commonly used for automobile exhaust systems. In 2015, ferritic stainless steel grades accounted for approximately 21 percent of Outokumpu's external stainless steel deliveries.
· Austenitic-ferritic (duplex) stainless steel grades have a micro structure that consists of both ferritic and austenitic phases. Duplex grades have a relatively high chromium content (between 18 and 28 percent) and a low to moderate nickel content (between 1 and 8 percent). The nickel content is insufficient to generate a fully austenitic structure and the resulting combination of ferritic and austenitic structures is called duplex. Many duplex grades also contain 2.5 to 4 percent molybdenum. Duplex grades have a high resistance to stress corrosion, cracking and chloride ion attacks as well as higher yield strength than austenitic or ferritic grades, which allows the construction of lighter structures as less material is required to achieve the same strength. They are commonly used in storage tanks, the pulp and paper industry, marine applications, desalination plants, heat exchangers and petrochemical plants. Outokumpu is the leading producer of duplex stainless steel grades globally in terms of market share (source: SMR, May 2016), which accounted for approximately 4 percent of Outokumpu's external stainless steel deliveries in 2015.
· Martensitic stainless steel grades have a relatively high carbon content (0.1 to 1.2 percent) as compared to other stainless steel grades, usually contain 11 to 13 percent chromium and may also contain nickel.
143

Martensitic grades have moderate corrosion resistance and are the only stainless steel grades that can be hardened by heat treatment, which gives them greater strength and hardness. Martensitic grades are magnetic and are generally difficult to weld. Martensitic grades are commonly used for knife blades, surgical instruments, turbine blades, shafts, spindles and pins. Outokumpu produces martensitic stainless steel grades in small quantities.
Ferrochrome
Ferrochrome, an alloy of chromium and iron containing 50 to 70 percent chromium, is an essential raw material in the stainless steel production. The most common type of ferrochrome on the market is charge grade ferrochrome, which typically contains 50 to 54 percent chromium, 6 to 8 percent carbon and 3 to 4 percent silicon.
Ferrochrome production begins with the mining of chromite, an iron chromium oxide. The chromite ore is concentrated into upgraded lumpy ore and fine concentrates for further processing. Prior to smelting, fine concentrate is formed into pellets and sintered in order to improve the performance of the smelting process. Upgraded lumpy ore does not need to undergo further processing prior to smelting.
In the ferrochrome smelting process, charge grade ferrochrome is heated, generally in an electric arc furnace, and reduced using metallurgical coke. Additional materials are added to promote slag formation, among other things. As liquid ferrochrome and slag collects at the bottom of the furnace, it is tapped and cast in large forms. In addition to slag, carbon monoxide is also formed as a by-product of the ferrochrome smelting process. After the ferrochrome cools, it is crushed to facilitate use in further processing.
Although it does not have any domestic sources of chromite, China has produced increasing amounts of ferrochrome in recent years and became the largest ferrochrome producer globally in 2012. China had a 35 percent share of global ferrochrome production in 2015 (source: CRU Ferrochrome Market Service, March 2016). Also, approximately 35 percent of the global ferrochrome production in 2015 took place in South Africa (source: CRU Ferrochrome Market Service, March 2015), which also holds an estimated 74 percent of the world's chromite resources (source: Department of Mineral Resources, South Africa; Heinz H. Pariser, May 2016). Other major ferrochrome producing countries include Kazakhstan and India, both of which have large domestic chromite resources. The EU's only chromite mine is Outokumpu's Kemi mine. Approximately 71 percent of the global ferrochrome production in 2015 was used by stainless steel producers (source: Heinz H. Pariser, May 2016).
Outokumpu's ferrochrome production facility is located in Tornio, Finland, where the facility has access to sufficient electricity and is close to Outokumpu's production units for further processing in Europe and from where the products can be shipped to Americas. The ferrochrome production facility is located on the same site as Outokumpu's stainless steel melt shop, which provides integration benefits such as the possibility of using molten ferrochrome in the stainless steel production process and using the carbon monoxide produced (as a by product) as a fuel in other heating processes. Following the doubling of its ferrochrome capacity in 2014 Outokumpu is fully self-sufficient with its ferrochrome needs globally.
Stainless Steel Production Process
Stainless steel production begins in the melt shop, where raw materials are melted and the alloy content of the steel is adjusted to the desired composition, after which the steel is cast into semi-finished products with various cross-sectional forms, such as slabs. Semi-finished products are further processed by hot and cold rolling or other production processes into finished products for customers.
M elting
In the melting process, raw materials are melted in an electric arc furnace, which consumes large amounts of electricity. In Europe, the main raw material for production of austenitic stainless steel grades is recycled stainless steel, while larger amounts of ferrochrome and recycled carbon steel are required for producing ferritic grades. After melting, the molten stainless steel is further processed in an Argon Oxygen Decarburization ("AOD") converter, where carbon is removed using oxygen-argon decarburization and sulfur is removed using a special slag treatment. The majority of the fine-tuning of the stainless steel's composition takes place in the
144

AOD converter due to the rigorous quality requirements placed on stainless steel. After the AOD process, the molten stainless steel undergoes secondary treatment in the ladle furnace, where fine tuning of the melt composition and temperature adjustments take place. Finally, the molten stainless steel is cast into semi-finished products, including slabs, billets and blooms, using a continuous casting process. Outokumpu's Tornio production facility is integrated into ferrochrome production, which allows molten ferrochrome to be used directly in stainless steel raw material, thereby reducing energy consumption as the ferrochrome does not need to be re-melted, among other benefits.
Hot Rolling
In the hot rolling process, the cast semi-finished products are first heated and then hot rolled using different hot rolling processes depending on the desired product. Flat products can either be produced in a hot strip mill, which passes a slab through a series of rolling mills in one direction to produce black hot band, or on a reversing mill, in which a slab is rolled back and forth through a single rolling mill to produce quarto plate.
Black hot band is used as feedstock for the initial annealing and pickling process in a cold rolling facility. After hot rolling, quarto plates are annealed, pickled and cut to the required dimensions before being delivered to customers. Quarto plates are primarily used for projects in the energy, chemical transportation and desalination industries as well as for pressure vessels, tanks, thick-walled tubes, bridge structures and process equipment.
For long products with a circular cross-section, billets or blooms are hot rolled to the desired diameter. Long products produced by hot rolling include rod coil, which is used to manufacture a range of precision components, including needles and pins, springs, welding consumables, fasteners and bolts, machined components and filtration components, and bars, which are used to manufacture a range of machined components, including valves, fittings, pump shafts and fasteners, and in a variety of infrastructure projects in the form of rebar and structural supports.
Cold Rolling
In the cold rolling process, black hot band is rolled at room temperature to reduce the thickness and achieve the desired properties. Black hot band is usually annealed and pickled into white hot band before the cold rolling process.
Initial Annealing and Pickling
Black hot band in austenitic grades must be processed on a continuous annealing and pickling line before it is ready for cold rolling. Respectively, ferritic and martensitic grades are normally processed first in a batch annealing furnace and then on a continuous pickling line before they are ready for cold rolling. The black hot band is first annealed (softened by heating) to promote desired properties in the steel. In the subsequent pickling process, the scale is chemically removed from the surface using acids.
The initial annealing and pickling produces white hot band, which is used as feedstock for cold rolling mills and can be sold to customers, primarily for projects within the energy, chemical transportation and desalination industries as well as for pressure vessels, tanks, thick-walled tubes, bridge structures and process equipment.
C old Rolling and Finishing
For producing cold rolled flat products, white hot band is usually rolled at room temperature on a cluster rolling mill to the desired thickness. The strip is then annealed and pickled as well as skin passed in order to improve the surface finish. Stainless steel with particularly high surface requirements can be annealed on a bright annealing line, which anneals the stainless steel in an atmosphere of inert gases. Bright annealing preserves and enhances the shiny metallic surface of the cold rolled strip, resulting in a mirror-like finish. Certain austenitic and ferritic stainless steel products are usually sold with a bright annealed finish. In addition, there are a variety of surface treatments, such as polishing, brushing and coating the steel with a fingerprint-resistant coating. The flatness of the strip can be improved by using a tension leveling line. Finally, the strip can be slit to form narrower strips or cut to the desired length to form foils or sheets. Cold rolled coils can also be used as feedstock for further cold rolling to produce thinner precision strip and foil.
145

Cold rolled products are used in a wide variety of end uses, ranging from demanding corrosion resistant solutions for the process industry and consumer durables made from polished strip, to prestigious buildings or other architectural applications that use patterned sheet. Due to their high dimensional tolerances and good surface quality, cold rolled products are the predominant category of stainless steels on the market.
Long Products Drawing
In addition to hot rolling, bars can also be formed by cold drawing. In the cold drawing process, unheated feedstock is drawn through a die to reduce the diameter and increase length. Before drawing, the end of the feedstock is reduced or pointed to get the end through the die, then the end is placed in grips and the rest of the feedstock is pulled through the die. Drawing can also be used to produce bar with noncircular cross-sections and thin wires.
Stainless Steel Distribution
Stainless steel is generally sold either directly to end users or to stainless steel distributors, tube makers and processors, such as steel service centers, who resell the products to end users. The usual method of distribution for stainless steel products varies by stainless steel type and product. Distributors tend to stock stainless steel products and grades that have many end users, such as regular austenitic cold rolled products and some austenitic long and tubular products. Distributors may also stock a limited amount of hot rolled austenitic stainless steel. Factors that lead end users to purchase stainless steel from distributors can include lead times, both due to proximity to the end user and the fact that the product is in stock, and the ability to order smaller quantities. In addition, distribution is often associated with some value added services, such as slitting and polishing.
Factors that lead end users to purchase directly from the producer can include purchasing large quantities or special grades as well as the need for technical advice. Generally, large end users, such as automobile and white goods manufacturers, prefer to purchase stainless steel directly from the producer in order to develop relationships and receive volume discounts. Many ferritic applications are used in industries that have consolidated purchasing, such as the automotive and white goods industries, which generally results in more direct routes to market as compared to austenitic products. In addition, end users interested in special grades, such as duplex grades, tend to purchase directly from producers due to the customizable nature of special grades products and the producer's technical knowledge and ability to provide advice on product selection and other matters. The tailor-made nature of special stainless steel products makes it less likely that distributors will have the specific product that the customer requires in stock.
Outokumpu sells both to end users (approximately 56 percent of sales in 2015) and to distributors and processors (approximately 44 percent of sales in 2015). See "Business Overview--Customers'"

Global real demand for stainless steel products reached 37.6 million tonnes in 2015, with a modest increase of around 2 percent from 37.1 million tonnes in 2014 and after annual average growth of around 8 percent between 2011 and 2014. The deceleration of growth was most pronounced in the APAC and Americas regions, where the growth slowed clearly below the average rates of previous years. Slowing economies in emerging markets, notably China, broadbased weakness in global manufacturing and deteriorating nickel prices resulted in weaker demand growth in 2015 compared with previous years. Real demand for stainless steel in the Europe reached 5.9 million tonnes in 2015, which means increase of modest 1 percent from 2014 despite the expected fragile recovery of the economy on the back of a weaker euro, low oil prices and less expensive credit. Of the major Western European countries, the demand for stainless steel in Germany and in Italy grew around 2 percent, while consumption levels in France and Benelux shrank (source: SMR, April 2016).

Consumption growth of the stainless steel products in the NAFTA stagnated in 2015, despite the robust growth of 8 percent in Mexico. Growth in the United States was flat on the back of weakness in the manufacturing sector driven firstly by collapsed investment in the oil and gas industry, and secondly on weaker exports due to the strong dollar. Meanwhile, consumption levels in South America were 13 percent lower in 2015 compared with 2014, amid a slump of 14 percent in Brazil (source: SMR, April 2016).

Global stainless steel demand is forecasted to reach 38.0 and 39.2 million tonnes in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Between 2016 and 2017, global stainless steel consumption is expected to increase at an annual average growth rate of around 2 percent, while growth is estimated to be mainly driven by increased consumption of around 3 percent in China and 2 percent in Asia, excluding China. Meanwhile, demand in Europe and NAFTA is estimated to remain on relatively stable levels without growth (source: SMR, April 2016).

Global consumption of stainless steel products in 2015 was split among the Consumer Goods and Medical (47 percent), Chemical, Petrochemical and Energy (16 percent), Automotive and Heavy Transport (10 percent), Architecture, Building, Construction and Infrastructure (15 percent), Industrial and Heavy Industry (8 percent)

147

and Others (3 percent) segments. In 2015, global consumption in the Chemical, Petrochemical and Energy segment decreased by 2 percent amid retreating oil prices, whereas the Automotive and Heavy Transport and Consumer Goods and Medical segments were the most resilient to the oil prices decrease, showing growth of around 3 percent in 2015 compared with 2 percent in 2014 (source: SMR, April 2016).

In Europe, global consumption of stainless steel products in the Automotive and Heavy Transport segment increased 4 percent and outperformed other segments in 2015 as it grew even faster than in the past few years. In contrast, consumption in Chemical, Petrochemical and Energy and Industrial and Heavy Industry segments were the weakest of all segments as their demand decreased by 1 percent compared to the consumption in 2014 (source: SMR, April 2016).

Also in the NAFTA region, global consumption of stainless steel products in Automotive and Heavy Transport showed the highest growth of around 6 percent in 2015, while the consumption in the Chemical, Petrochemical and Energy segment was the weakest and decreased by 12 percent in 2015 compared to the consumption in 2014 (source: SMR, April 2016).

Outokumpu believes that the overall long-term prospects for stainless steel demand remain positive. Key global megatrends in urbanization, modernization and increased mobility combined with growing global demand for energy, food and water are expected to promote the growth of stainless steel demand in the future. SMR forecasts an average annual growth rate of around 2 percent (CAGR) for global stainless steel consumption between 2016 and 2017, mainly attributable to increased demand from the Architecture, Building, Construction and Infrastructure and the Consumer Goods and Medical, which is expected to be around 4 percent, while also Automotive and Heavy Transport is expected to grow at around 3 percent annually between 2016 and 2017 (source: SMR, April 2016).

2.1

In recent years, there have been significant changes in the consumption of stainless steel grade groups, mainly attributable to higher and more volatile nickel prices and increased stainless steel production in China and India. These factors have contributed to a decrease in the relative consumption of 300 series (nickel containing) stainless steel grades and an increase of no nickel (ferritic) stainless steel grades and low nickel stainless steel grades (200 series, lean duplex). From over 75 percent of total finished stainless steel consumption in the 1990s, the relative consumption of 300 series stainless steel declined to approximately 53 percent in 2015. Over this period, the relative consumption of ferritic, 200 series and duplex stainless steel grades have increased to approximately 27 percent, 19 percent and 2 percent, respectively (source: SMR, April 2016).

In 2015, consumption of both ferritic and duplex stainless steel grades grew at around 3 percent compared to the consumption in 2014. The 300 series stainless steel consumption grew by around 1 percent while consumption of 200 series stainless steel grades remained on same levels as in 2014. Between 2016 and 2017, SMR forecasts that ferritic stainless steel grades will be the fastest growing in terms of consumption (4 percent CAGR), while duplex and 200 series stainless steel grades are expected to grow annually at around 3 percent and 2 percent

148

respectively. Meanwhile, the consumption of the 300 series stainless steel grades is expected to grow by only 1 percent annually on average (source: SMR, April 2016).
Production
Global crude stainless steel production was 42.1 million tonnes in 2015, a decrease of 1.7 percent compared to 2014. This was the first time since 2009 that production shrank, and the decline was broad-based between the regions. In Europe, stainless steel production was 7.1 million tonnes in 2015, a decrease of 1.4 percent compared to 2014. In China, stainless steel production grew at an annual average pace of around 19 percent between 2007 and 2014, but decreased by 2.0 percent to 22.3 million tonnes in 2015. Of the major regions and countries, only India and South Africa increased output in 2015 compared to 2014 (source: SMR, February 2016).
In response to strong demand for stainless steel products from China in the 1990s and early 2000s, the European stainless steel industry made significant investments in increasing production capacity. However, during the 2000s, China rapidly invested in the construction of local stainless steel production capacity. As China transitioned from being a net importer of stainless steel to being the world's largest stainless steel producer and a net exporter of stainless steel products, the capacity utilization levels of stainless steel producers in other regions decreased. With Chinese stainless steel producers serving domestic demand and increasingly exporting their material around the world, stainless steel producers in other countries have been forced to find new markets for production that was previously destined for China as well as for production destined for their local demand, which Chinese producers have increasingly been serving. Moreover, price advantages in Asia keep up the attractiveness of imported material in the European market. The price advantages result from the high investments of Asian mills in new state-of-the art facilities with high production capacities, economies of scale and partially from cost advantages, for example, from using alternative raw materials such as nickel pig iron. These pressures have led to substantially higher levels of stainless steel imports into the European market, which increased from around 20 percent of total consumption (of cold rolled flat products) between 2011 and 2012 to 30.6 percent in 2014. In 2015 import levels decreased to 24.6 percent after introduction of anti-dumping duties by EU commission for Chinese and Taiwanese cold rolled imports. Asia accounted for approximately 64 percent of the total amount of cold rolled imports into the Europe in 2015, down from 78 percent in 2014 and from 72 percent on average between 2012 and 2013 (source: EUROFER May 2016). Average cold rolled imports into NAFTA increased to 23.7 percent of the total consumption in 2015, up from 19.6 percent in 2014 and 13.4 percent in 2013 after surge of volumes from Asia after anti-dumping duties for Chinese and Taiwanese were imposed in Europe in 2015 (source: AISI, May 2016).
Rapid growth in Chinese stainless steel production capacity combined with low growth in European stainless steel consumption has exacerbated the overcapacity in Europe and limited growth opportunities for European stainless steel producers, particularly in standard grades. In addition to price pressure, overcapacity has resulted in lower production capacity utilization rates for European producers. The production of stainless steel is capital intensive and producers generally seek to maintain high capacity utilization levels to improve their profitability. Increased stainless steel production capacity in Asia, especially increased melting capacity, has reduced demand for European semi-finished products to negligible levels.
Stainless Steel Competition
The global crude stainless steel capacity in 2015, including flat and long products, totaled approximately 68.4 million tonnes, up slightly from 68.1 million tonnes in 2014. The largest producers based on crude stainless capacity are Tsingshan, TISCO, POSCO, Outokumpu, Baosteel, Acerinox, Aperam and LISCO (source: SMR, February 2016).
Outokumpu's primary competitors in Europe in 2015 were Aperam, Acerinox and AST, which are all global suppliers, and Outokumpu also competed with imports from outside of Europe (primarily from Taiwan, South Korea, China, Japan, India, South Africa and the United States). Local suppliers generally account for the majority of stainless steel sales in other regional markets in which local presence, knowledge and often trade barriers may provide them with advantages. In NAFTA, the main stainless steel producers are North American Stainless (a member of the Acerinox group), Outokumpu, AK Steel Corporation and ATI Allegheny Ludlum Corporation. In Asia, the significant new capacity built in recent years has resulted in a fragmented market where there are more than 50 manufacturers. Local producers mostly focus on lower margin commodity products, making it difficult to gain market share in the commodity products market. China is a highly competitive market
149

with many competitors having a fully integrated production chain from melting to cold rolling operation. The main stainless steel producers in Asia are Posco, Tisco, Baosteel, Tsingshan, Yusco, JISCO, Nippon Steel & Sumikin Stainless Steel Corporation (NSSC) and Nisshin Steel Co., Ltd.

Outokumpu uses a variety of means to transport products to customers, including truck, ship and train. Outokumpu primarily transports products between its production facilities by ship and train as well as by truck. Within Europe, the Tornio production facility supplies a portion of the black hot band feedstock to its cold rolling facility in Germany. This material is transported from Outokumpu's own harbor at the Tornio site to Outokumpu's finishing facility in Terneuzen, the Netherlands using Outokumpu's fleet of four time-chartered vessels. The material is then transported by train to the production facilities. Train is also the primary means of transporting products between Outokumpu's production facilities in Germany. Outokumpu maximizes the utilization of its vessels by transporting recycled stainless steel, other raw materials and consumables from ports such as Rotterdam on the return trip to Tornio.
In North America, Outokumpu transports products from the Calvert production facility to its cold rolling facility in Mexico primarily by ship. The Calvert production facility is located on a site that includes a barge terminal owned by third parties. Outokumpu expects to increasingly spot charter vessels in the future, primarily to transport ferrochrome and stainless steel from the Tornio production facility to the Calvert production facility.

Americas' customers include the automotive and transport, consumer appliances, oil and gas, chemical and petrochemical, food and beverage processing as well as building and construction industries. Business area Long Products' sales are primarily to distributors and processors.
The usual method of distribution for stainless steel products varies by stainless steel type and product. Distributors tend to stock stainless steel products and grades that have many end uses, such as regular austenitic cold rolled products and some austenitic long and tubular products. Factors that lead end users to purchase stainless steel products directly from the producer include purchasing large quantities, purchasing special grades and the need for technical advice. For more information, see "Industry and Market Overview--Stainless Steel Distribution."
Sales Contracts
Outokumpu's stainless steel sales generally fall within three categories: sales under frame purchase agreements, sales under long-term contracts and spot sales. Sales to stainless steel distributors and processors are generally made under frame purchase agreements that fix the terms of delivery, but not the base price, which is determined based on the market price and alloy surcharge at the time of each order. Direct sales to end users are generally made under long-term contracts of three to 12 months with fixed volume commitments. These long-term contracts generally have either a fixed price or a fixed base price and a floating alloy surcharge. Spot sales at the prevailing market prices are generally made to distributors and processors as well as to some end users attempting to secure the best price and delivery terms available at the time.
Outokumpu sells ferrochrome under two-year contracts and on a spot basis. Long-term contracts typically have agreed volumes, with prices negotiated on a quarterly basis based on reference prices.

The process development is also focused on further development of production routes and on process optimization, including process simulation, modeling of melting, rolling and annealing processes as well as information management. The product development is mainly directed at developing new steel grades and surfaces, as well as improving the properties of stainless steel products. In addition, the product development focuses on cost-efficient low-nickel and no-nickel stainless steel grades and on value-added special products such as high-corrosion-resistance, heat-resistant and high-strength stainless steels. Other important areas in research and development include application development and providing customers with comprehensive technical support. Outokumpu's research and development function operates in close cooperation with Outokumpu's business areas, business lines and sales organizations and is a source of valuable advice regarding material selection, properties and fabrication techniques for customers.
Outokumpu's research and development teams are also involved in joint projects with Outokumpu's customers. Outokumpu also conducts joint development projects with industrial partners, universities and research institutes within national and European research programs.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, Outokumpu spent EUR 23 million on research and development, as compared to EUR 23 million and EUR 6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and three months ended March 31, 2016, respectively. As at December 31, 2015, the Research Centers employed a total of approximately 240 people and additional resources are working in research positions at Outokumpu's production sites globally.
Intellectual Property
Outokumpu seeks to protect its innovations by obtaining appropriate intellectual property protection and maintaining and enforcing its existing key intellectual property rights. Outokumpu relies on patent, trade secret and trademark laws and on confidentiality agreements to protect its products, proprietary technology and know how. Outokumpu has a patent portfolio that, as at December 31, 2015, included 89 patent families (each patent family is based on a single invention that may be filed in separate countries) comprised of 373 granted patents and 322 patent applications. Outokumpu also owns a portfolio of 91 trademark families (each trademark family is a single trademark that may be filed in separate trademark classes and separate countries) comprised of 602 registered trademarks and 122 trademark applications. Outokumpu's patent portfolio covers the countries that are of major economic importance to the business of Outokumpu, in particular the countries in Europe and NAFTA, as well as countries in which important competitors are located, including China, South Korea and Japan. Its most important patented products include LDX 2101®, LDX 2404®, FDX®25 and FDX®27 for duplex grades as well as trademark-protected 254 SMO® and 654 SMO® for superaustenitic grades. Outokumpu has also patented certain proprietary stainless steel and ferrochrome production processes.
Outokumpu's patents are predominantly derived from employee inventions. Some of the patents and patent applications in Outokumpu's patent portfolio are co-owned with third parties. In addition to its patent portfolio, Outokumpu also relies on trade secrets, know-how, development of new products, and technological development in combination with nondisclosure agreements and similar agreements. Outokumpu also licenses a limited number of patents, patent applications and trademarks from third parties and selectively grants licenses to its trademarks and patents. For example, in order to facilitate market penetration of duplex stainless steel, Outokumpu has granted LDX 2101® manufacturing licenses to a number of third-party stainless steel producers in Europe and Asia under which Outokumpu is entitled to minimal royalty payments.
In 2006, the size of Outokumpu's patent portfolio was significantly reduced due to the divestment of Outotec Oyj. See "Information about the Issuer--History" above. As part of the divestment, Outokumpu retained a perpetual, royalty-free license from Outotec Oyj to use patents and inventions applicable to Outokumpu's ferrochrome production. Outokumpu believes that its intellectual property is of great value to it; however, Outokumpu also believes that its business, financial condition and results of operations are not dependent on any single patent, design patent or utility model.
157

Employees
As at March 31, 2016, Outokumpu had 10,920 employees. Outokumpu believes that its relationships with its employees and labor unions are good. A significant portion of Outokumpu's employees in Europe are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Outokumpu is committed to providing a safe working environment for its employees, subcontractors and suppliers at Outokumpu's production sites and other facilities. Outokumpu is also accountable for the safety of subcontractors and suppliers while they are working in Outokumpu's locations. Developments in occupational safety measures are monitored at operating unit level and reported to local and central management through performance management processes. Outokumpu has an Occupational Safety Committee that aims to identify the best corporate and external practices and ensure that related knowledge and experience is distributed within Outokumpu. The Group's lost time injuries per one million working hours were 3.0 in 2015.
Insurance
Outokumpu's management believes that Outokumpu and its subsidiaries maintain insurance coverage that reflects the requirements and the size of the parent company, business areas and subsidiaries concerned. Historically, Outokumpu has maintained insurance on its property in amounts and risk retention levels that Outokumpu's management believes to be consistent with industry practices. Outokumpu's properties and facilities globally are valued at their reinstatement value and these values are based on careful assessments conducted at each location. Outokumpu's insurance policies cover physical loss or damage to its property and equipment on a reinstatement basis arising from a number of specified risks and certain consequential losses, including business interruption arising from the occurrence of an insured event under these policies.
Outokumpu has also maintained various other types of insurance, such as general and products liability insurance, directors and officers liability insurance, credit insurance, transport and marine cargo insurance, as well as other customary policies such as commercial crime insurance, corporate business travel insurance and expatriates' insurance.
In addition, Outokumpu maintains various local insurance policies that are mandatory at the local level, such as employer's liability, workers compensation and motor vehicle liability insurances, as well as specific insurance policies covering compliance with local regulations.
Outokumpu uses insurance broker services to place and maintain the global insurance programs with accesses to insurance markets in the United Kingdom, the Nordic region and Central Europe. Broker services are also used to support Outokumpu's risk management with comprehensive fire safety and loss prevention surveys according to an annual program.
Outokumpu also has a captive insurance company, Visenta Försäkrings AB ("Visenta"), which is domiciled in Sweden and is able to act in more than 20 countries. Visenta underwrites property and surety insurance policies for Outokumpu Oyj and its subsidiaries.
Environmental Matters
O verview
Outokumpu's EHSQ policy (Environment, Health, Safety and Quality including energy efficiency) aims at minimizing the environmental impact of Outokumpu's operations. Outokumpu's all production facilities employ risk-based and certified ISO 14001 environmental management systems that are designed to assist in avoiding spills and other incidents. The functioning of Outokumpu's environmental management systems is monitored using both internal and external audits at regular intervals.
Outokumpu's costs for environmental related activities in 2015 amounted to EUR 89 million, of which costs associated with emissions and treatment and disposal of waste and remediation amounted to EUR 81 million. Additionally, environmental investments by Outokumpu in 2015 amounted to approximately EUR 8 million. As at December 31, 2015, Outokumpu had environmental provisions of EUR 63 million in its consolidated
158

statement of financial position. The majority of the environmental provisions are related to closing costs for landfills and waste management and site closures.
Em issions (Air and Noise)
Some of Outokumpu's production sites have significant air emissions, which Outokumpu may have to reduce in the future. The majority of Outokumpu's particle emissions originate from the Tornio, Avesta, Sheffield and Calvert sites. At the Calvert site in the United States, it is unlikely that future restrictions on nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter emissions may limit the facility's ability to expand operations and maintain compliance with applicable regulations.
Significant noise emissions exist at some of Outokumpu's facilities and may require noise reduction measures in the future.
Soil and Groundwater Contamination
Some of Outokumpu's production sites have been used in large-scale metal industry operations for long periods of time, which increases the likelihood that contamination exists at these production sites. Soil contamination has been identified on some of Outokumpu's sites. In 2011, Outokumpu performed soil investigations at the former Avesta production site and the Nyby site in Sweden. These studies indicated that the soil is contaminated. As a result, Outokumpu conducted water quality analyses in Avesta. In Nyby, the authorities have requested some further investigations to be conducted on the site. In addition, Outokumpu is responsible for conducting remediation at closed landfill sites. Outokumpu has closed a former landfill area in Nyby and has completed the closure of a landfill area in Tornio. Ten years of remediation work at the old landfill in Tornio has reduced concentrations of metal leakage into groundwater to levels below those required for drinking water. Remediation activities in connection with contaminated groundwater continue with an old oil leakage at a former warehouse site in Montreal, Canada. In Wildwood, Florida, United States, groundwater remediation has decreased contaminants significantly. The groundwater system has been down from 2015 but Wildwood must conduct quarterly testing of the groundwater. The State will review the results and determine whether Wildwood will have to turn the treatment system on as the testing progresses.
At Outokumpu's sites and adjacent properties in Dillenburg, Krefeld and Benrath, Germany, the soil and groundwater is contaminated either with metals from acids, oil, chlorinated solvents, chlorinated hydrocarbons and petroleum hydrocarbons, and respective investigations and remediation operations are ongoing. In Dahlerbruck, Germany, Outokumpu has completed remediation of groundwater with the oral confirmation of the authorities and no additional remediation is required.
Regarding the closed sites, soil and groundwater investigation has been conducted at Kloster, Sweden, and in Bochum, Germany and the authorities have accepted Outokumpu's plans for the shutdown process (organization and planning).
Soil and groundwater contamination has also been identified at other Outokumpu sites and additional contamination of soil or groundwater may be discovered at various sites in the future resulting from, among other things, the handling and storage of hazardous substances and the current, former or future landfills. If further contamination is discovered, Outokumpu may, as the present or former owner or user of the respective property, be held liable for addressing that contamination and natural resource damages, regardless of knowledge or fault, even if Outokumpu did not cause the contamination or if the activity that caused the contamination complied with applicable regulations. Environmental liability can be joint and several, and as a result, Outokumpu may be held responsible for more than its share of contamination or other damages. Outokumpu may also be held liable for costs associated with addressing contamination at third-party sites.
H andling and Storage of Hazardous Substances
Hazardous substances are regularly used at Outokumpu's sites. For example, hydrofluoric acid is used in the pickling process for removing scale from the surface of products. Other hazardous substances are also required for the operation of Outokumpu's sites, including diesel fuel, heating fuel oil, lubricating and hydraulic oil and propane, which are used and stored in certified equipment that is examined regularly. Some of Outokumpu's
159

sites, for example, the sites in Avesta, Degerfors and Nyby, Sweden, Tomio, Finland, and parts of the sites in Krefeld, Benrath and Dillenburg, Germany, are subject to rules for the prevention of major accidents in connection with hazardous substances under the Directive 2012/18/EC of July 2012.
Waste M anagem ent
Dust, slag, sludge and scale collected from stainless steel manufacturing operations are the most significant waste categories for Outokumpu. These waste materials are collected and, wherever practical, recycled to recover the alloying elements they contain (such as nickel, chromium and molybdenum). Waste from Outokumpu production units is sent to appropriate treatment facilities or to landfill sites licensed to accept such materials.
A significant amount of the slag generated at Outokumpu's sites is processed and sold for use in construction. Slag from Outokumpu's sites that is not suitable for use in construction is disposed of by Outokumpu.
For waste materials that must be disposed of, Outokumpu uses its own landfills as well as third-party landfills. Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH used the Marbach landfill in Bochum-Hamme, Germany, until 1987 and the Blucherstrasse landfill in Bochum-Wattenscheid, Germany, until 2009. Outokumpu received the approval of the plans to reactivate and extend the Marbach landfill. Construction of the first phase of the landfill is completed and landfilling of the remaining waste material of the closed Bochum plant has been iniated. See "--
A dm inistrative Proceedings and P erm it A pplications--Resum ption o f O perations a t the M arbach Landfill in
Bochum-Hamme, G erm any" below. In addition, Outokumpu has filed an application for the formal closure of the Blucherstrasse landfill together with a proposal for post-closure measure plan. Outokumpu also owns and manages landfill sites at its production sites in Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
As an operator of landfills, Outokumpu is subject to various obligations and requirements during and after the use of a landfill, including closure, securing, monitoring and recultivation requirements. At the closed Dillenburg landfill in Hirzenhain (Eschenburg), Germany, which was operated by Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH, Outokumpu was requested to conduct investigations regarding the stability of the landfill to determine the necessary future measures. The investigations showed that there is structural stability, but monitoring should make sure that the constructional stability is still given. Monitoring is ongoing as at the date of this Prospectus.
Water and Waste Water
Stainless steel production involves high-temperature processes with extensive cooling requirements. To protect personnel and manufacturing equipment, Outokumpu's primary production operations employ water for cooling. Water is used to cool steel surfaces through direct contact and indirectly through heat exchangers and cooling systems.
The consumption of fresh water is reduced at Outokumpu's sites through the use of storm water, recycling, cascade use of water and other measures. To reduce concentrations of pollutants in the water to permitted levels, waste water undergoes pre-treatment at Outokumpu's sites and is then usually discharged into the public sewage system or into surface water bodies. On-site sewer systems exist at several of Outokumpu's sites and are continuously monitored and repaired or replaced as necessary.
From an environmental perspective, the most significant components in water discharged from Outokumpu's manufacturing processes are metal compounds and nitrates that result from neutralizing acidic waste generated in cold rolling units.
At the Dillenburg site in Germany, Outokumpu is currently upgrading procedures that treat certain liquids prior to their discharge as wastewater in order to comply with the requirements of its wastewater permit. This will be done by an ongoing and upgrading investing into the municipal wastewater treatment plant which is ongoing to improve nitrate treatment of acid wastewater. From the total investment costs of EUR 2 million together with the municipality, the costs for Outokumpu are not material.

Administrative Proceedings and Permit Applications
Environmental Perm it Application fo r Outokumpu Stainless Oy and Outokumpu Chrome O y (Tornio, Finland)
Outokumpu Stainless Oy and Outokumpu Chrome Oy were granted a new environmental permit in August 2012. The permit, even though it was appealed against, enabled the companies, including the ferrochrome facility, to continue their operations. Outokumpu successfully defended the permit and the Vaasa Administrative Court dismissed the appeals on December 3, 2014. During the appeal period, no further appeals were made and the permit granted in 2012 is now final. Outokumpu Stainless Oy and Outokumpu Chrome Oy will have to file an application for the renewal of the environmental permit by the end of 2017.
Nyby Soil Survey
Outokumpu Stainless AB's and Outokumpu Stainless Tubular Products AB's Nyby sites in Sweden, together with a third company in the area, submitted a soil survey to the environmental authorities in January 2012, which indicated that there is contamination at the sites. The environmental authorities requested further investigations. The authorities were content with the further studies Outokumpu Stainless AB conducted on its site. The site of Outokumpu Stainless Tubular Products AB was bought by Outokumpu Stainless AB and investigations are still ongoing as at the date of this Prospectus.
Relocation o f Benrath C old Rolling Facility to K refeld
Outokumpu has an ongoing investment plan to relocate its cold rolling facility in Benrath, Germany, to its Krefeld production facility. The relocation of the facility and its operations to Krefeld requires a permit under the German Federal Emission Control Act. Outokumpu received the permit for a revised project in February 2016. One of the neighbors of the facility has appealed against the permit but the grounds for the appeal are not yet known. The authority permitted an immediate execution of the permit to enable the realization of the project.
Resumption o f Operations at the M arbach Landfill in Bochum-Hamme, Germany
The Environmental Authority of Hagen (Umweltamt Hagen) has granted Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH a planning approval decision (Planfeststellungsbeschluss) under the German Closed Substance Cycle and Waste Management Act (Kreislaufwirtschafts- und Abfallgesetz) for the resumption of operations and the extension of its Marbach landfill in Bochum-Hamme, Germany. The planning approval decision was challenged by two neighbors. After an amicable settlement with these neighbors, the planning approval decision is now final and binding (bestandskraftig). Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH has completed the preparation construction work and started the landfilling. For the construction, closure and post closure of the Marbach landfill, Outokumpu had recorded provisions of EUR 8.9 million as at December 31, 2015.
Environm ental M atters Relating to the D ivestm ent o f the Terni Rem edy A ssets and the VDM Business
The Terni site and the VDM operations have been part of Outokumpu since the Inoxum Acquisition Completion Date. Based on the due diligence Outokumpu has conducted on the divested sites, the Terni site in Italy has been listed on the Italian list of Contaminated Sites of National Interest and significant environmental issues have been identified in Terni. Soil and groundwater contamination and other environmental issues have also been identified at several VDM sites. Pursuant to the terms of the Framework Agreement, Outokumpu will be responsible for any damage or liability that may arise in relation to the Terni and VDM sites, including environmental liabilities, during five years after the completion of the divestment of the Terni Remedy Assets and the VDM Business. However, ThyssenKrupp is not entitled to recover any loss, damage or liability to the extent attributable to any event or circumstance occurred or deemed to have occurred before the Inoxum Acquisition Completion Date. Outokumpu has no reason to believe that Outokumpu's actions during its ownership would lead to any material damage or liability of which it would be liable to ThyssenKrupp.
Legal Proceedings
Except as set forth below, neither the Issuer nor the Guarantors have pending governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any proceedings which are pending or threatened of which Outokumpu is aware) which
161

may have, or have had in the past 12 months, a significant effect on the financial position or profitability of Outokumpu or its subsidiaries, as a whole.
Dispute over Invention Rights between Outokumpu and Outotec Oyj
In January 2013, Outokumpu and Outotec entered into a legal dispute over invention rights related to a ferrochromenickel production method. In August 2013, Outotec submitted an application for summons at the District Court of Helsinki regarding another patent relating to the invention. The production method is developed by Outokumpu and Outokumpu has filed the patent applications related to this invention. Outotec claimed it had rights to the inventions. In February 2014, Outotec submitted to the Arbitration Institute of the Finland Chamber of Commerce a request for arbitration against Outokumpu concerning the same invention rights being subject to the District Court proceedings. Simultaneously, Outotec filed a proposal to the District Court for postponement of these proceedings until the Arbitration Court would render its arbitral award. In August 2015, the Arbitration Court rendered its award, in which it ruled that Outotec's employee had contributed to the inventions and accordingly granted Outotec partial rights to the patents in question. The Arbitration Court ruled also that commercial use of the patent rights by Outotec is subject to agreement between the parties. In 2016, Outotec withdrew its claims against Outokumpu in the District Court. In April 2016 Outotec submitted to the Arbitration Institute of the Finland Chamber of Commerce another request for arbitration against Outokumpu concerning the commercial rights of the same invention rights. Outokumpu finds these claims unjustified and intends to defend its rights in the Arbitration proceedings.
Cartel fine im posed by the European Commission
In March 2011, the European Court of Justice upheld a EUR 3.2 million cartel fine imposed on ThyssenKrupp Stainless AG, a legal predecessor of Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH ("Nirosta"), in a decision of the European Commission from December 2006 (the "2006 Decision"). The 2006 Decision is based on a 1998 European Commission finding (the "1998 Finding") that between 1993 and 1998, certain stainless steel producers, including Inoxum and certain of its legal predecessors, had violated Article 65 (1) of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty by participating in a price-fixing arrangement with other stainless steel producers. The alleged price-fixing arrangement consisted of modifying and applying in a concerted fashion the reference values used to calculate the alloy surcharge to the base price of stainless steel. The 1998 Finding was appealed and subsequently annulled on procedural grounds with respect to Nirosta's liability for one of its legal predecessors. Subsequent to this annulment, the European Commission opened new proceedings, which resulted in the 2006 Decision. Nirosta's appeals of the 2006 Decision were unsuccessful. In April 2011, Nirosta filed a complaint (Verfassungsbeschwerde) with the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) requesting that the Court declares the 2006 Decision incompatible with certain fundamental rights under the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). As at the end of the reporting period, the German Constitutional Court has not decided whether it will accept the constitutional complaint. In case of a successful complaint, Nirosta is able to reclaim EUR 4.2 million from the European Commission.
Claim in Spain related to the divested copper companies
Outokumpu divested all of its copper business in 2003-2008. One of the divested companies domiciled in Spain later faced bankruptcy. The administrator in bankruptcy filed a claim against Outokumpu Oyj and two other nonOutokumpu companies, for recovery of payments made by the bankrupt Spanish company in connection with the divestment. The Bilbao court of first instance in Spain has in July 2014 accepted the claim of EUR 20 million brought against Outokumpu and the two other companies. Outokumpu and the two other companies have appealed the court's decision.
Outokumpu finds there are strong arguments for rejecting the claim of EUR 20 million in higher court instances as Outokumpu believes that the recovery claim is statute-barred. Furthermore, creditors of the bankrupt company at the time of divestment have been paid.
Claim in Italy related to form er tax consolidation group
In December 2015 Outokumpu Holding Italia and Acciai Speciali Terni (AST) entered into a dispute among relating to the tax consolidation of the former ThyssenKrupp Tax Group in Italy. AST claims payment of approximately EUR 23 million resulting from the former tax consolidation of the Italian tax group managed by
162

ThyssenKrupp. Outokumpu Holding Italia is the former ThyssenKrupp holding company and was transferred to Inoxum as part of the carve-out in 2011. The EUR 23 million claim resulted from former tax installments paid by ThyssenKrupp Italia in 2006 which not have been properly settled towards AST in the following years. Outokumpu has in March 2016 presented its defense against the claim as it holds the claim unjustified.
Agreements outside the Ordinary Course of Business
Framework Agreement
On November 29 2013, Outokumpu entered into Framework Agreement with ThyssenKrupp whereby Outokumpu Oyj agreed to sell to ThyssenKrupp the Terni production facility in order to comply with the commitments made to the European Commission: AST, Terninox S.p.A., Aspasiel S.r.l., Tubificio di Terni S.p.A. and Societa delle Fucine S.r.l., as well as the shares in companies that owned Outokumpu's service centers in Willich, Germany; Barcelona, Spain; Gebze, Turkey; and Tours, France (together, the "Terni Remedy Assets") and the shares in legal entities that owned and operated the HPA business (the "VDM Business") in return for the full transferal and consequently cancellation of the Loan Note (the "Framework Agreement"). The divestment of the Terni Remedy Assets and the VDM Business was completed on February 28, 2014. Such divestment was subject to the completion of certain refinancing measures (see "Information about the Issuer-- Investments, Divestm ents and O ther R ecent Events--R efinancing and Repaym ent o f D e b t") and it constituted final settlement of all remedy related obligations between Outokumpu and ThyssenKrupp.
In the Framework Agreement, Outokumpu and ThyssenKrupp provided certain warranties and undertakings to each other. In addition to certain customary warranties, the warranties provided by Outokumpu include a warranty covering damages or liabilities resulting from environmental matters or breach of any applicable laws in relation to antibribery, corruption or competition during Outokumpu's time of ownership of the divested businesses. The maximum aggregate liability of Outokumpu for breach of warranty is EUR 100 million and any loss, damage or liability may not be recovered to the extent attributable to any event or circumstance occurred or deemed to have occurred before December 28, 2012. The claim notice period for breach of warranty is either five years or 18 months from the completion date of the divestment of Terni Remedy Assets and the VDM Business depending on the claim.
Inoxum Acquisition
Overview
On January 31, 2012, Outokumpu Oyj entered into a business combination agreement (the "Business Combination Agreement") with ThyssenKrupp, pursuant to which Outokumpu acquired from ThyssenKrupp all shares in both Inoxum GmbH and ThyssenKrupp Nirosta GmbH, the parent companies of the group comprising the stainless steel business of ThyssenKrupp. The Inoxum Acquisition was completed on December 28, 2012. Outokumpu entered into several agreements in relation to this transaction, some of which are still effective.
Business Combination Agreement
In the Business Combination Agreement, Outokumpu Oyj and ThyssenKrupp provided certain warranties and undertakings to each other. The warranties provided by ThyssenKrupp included that all agreements entered into between Inoxum and ThyssenKrupp regarding shared services and continued operations after the completion of the Inoxum Acquisition that are material to Inoxum's business were disclosed to Outokumpu and that they were all arm's length agreements. ThyssenKrupp agreed to offer employment to up to 600 employees of the Bochum or Krefeld melt shops within 30 days of the implementation of measures directed to the closures of those melt shops. In accordance with the Framework Agreement, the Business Combination Agreement was terminated as of the closing of the divestment of the Terni Remedy Assets and the VDM Business, except for some sections regarding, for example, tax covenant, guarantees and employees of the Bochum and Krefeld melt shops.
163

German Labor Agreements

Prior to the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, on January 31, 2012, Outokumpu Oyj, ThyssenKrupp and the German employee representatives reached an agreement regarding the production facilities and employment protection in Germany. In accordance with the agreement, the Krefeld melt shop was closed in the end of 2013 and it was envisaged that the Bochum melt shop could be closed by the end of 2016. The economic viability of the Bochum melt shop was to be reviewed prior to the final decisions on its closure. All other Outokumpu production sites in Germany were to be retained until the end of 2015. The parties also agreed that there were to be no compulsory redundancies at any Outokumpu production sites in Germany until the end of 2015. In the Business Combination Agreement, ThyssenKrupp agreed to offer alternative jobs at ThyssenKrupp to up to 600 employees currently employed by Outokumpu.

On October 1, 2013, Outokumpu began discussions with German employee representatives to change a collective (tariff) agreement that was signed in connection with the Inoxum Acquisition. The principal requested changes were:

· accelerating the closure of the melt shop in Bochum to the beginning of 2015 instead of the end of 2016, depending on the negotiations;
· additional headcount reductions up to 1,000 employees; and
· a reduction of the investment in the Krefeld production facility as a precondition to close the Benrath production facility from EUR 244 million to EUR 100 million.
On March 30, 2014 Outokumpu entered into an Amendment to the existing Tariff Agreement in which the terms and conditions for the above-mentioned principals have been agreed upon with the German union IG Metall. The main principles of this amendment were:

A. Bochum melt shop could be closed in the course of 2015, following a production transfer process that ensures continuation of high quality deliveries to customers after the Bochum closure. Bochum melt shop was actually closed in June 2015;

B.

Outokumpu invests EUR 108 million to the Krefeld cold rolling center in Germany between 2014 and

2016 through the ferritic production optimization (NIFO-project);

C. Benrath cold rolling mill is expected to be closed in 2016 after the production transfer to Krefeld has been completed; and

New industrial concept which as at the date of this Prospectus is being implemented is intended to result in an additional headcount reduction of up to 1,000 employees.

Operational Agreem ents with ThyssenKrupp

Overview

In relation to the Inoxum Acquisition, Inoxum (now, Outokumpu) and ThyssenKrupp entered into to a number of service and other agreements and other business relationships related to certain shared functions and sites, some of which continue as at the date of this Prospectus.

Inoxum (now, Outokumpu) and ThyssenKrupp established general principles for continuing such relationships in an interface framework agreement (the "Interface Framework Agreement"). In the Business Combination Agreement, ThyssenKrupp provided a warranty that all of the material agreements governing relationships between Inoxum and ThyssenKrupp that have been entered into, varied or amended as a result of, and in connection with, ThyssenKrupp's separation of its stainless steel and high performance alloys businesses from its other operations (the "Inoxum Separation") are arm's length arrangements.

The majority of the agreements relating to such relationships concern matters in the ordinary course of business, such as IT systems and electronic data and firefighting services. A smaller number concern more significant matters, such as cash pooling, hedging contracts, sharing of sites, raw material supply and mill services.

164

The following summaries relate to the material arrangements between Inoxum and ThyssenKrupp that has continued after the completion of the Inoxum Acquisition.
Interface Framework Agreement
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement (see "--Business Combination A greem en t" above), on January 31, 2012, ThyssenKrupp, Inoxum GmbH and Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH entered into the Interface Framework Agreement, which provides a framework for the Inoxum Separation by defining the allocation of liabilities between Inoxum and ThyssenKrupp (and their respective subsidiary companies), providing general principles for agreements regarding shared functions and facilities that will continue after the completion of the Inoxum Separation and setting forth the terms for the transition of certain other functions, such as insurance, intellectual property, IT, cash pooling and hedging.
With respect to the allocation of liabilities, Inoxum and ThyssenKrupp agreed on a reciprocal indemnification in the event that one party is held responsible for any liabilities that are related to the activities of the other party and exist at the completion of the Inoxum Acquisition. In addition, Inoxum and ThyssenKrupp also agreed on reciprocal indemnification in the event subsidies and comparable benefits that were originally attributed to one party are reclaimed from the other party.
With respect to general principles governing business arrangements that will remain in place following the Inoxum Separation, Inoxum and ThyssenKrupp agreed that such existing relationships that are governed by written agreements will, subject to exceptions, continue according to their terms. Existing relationships that are not governed by written agreements will continue on arm's length terms. In addition, existing IT systems were separated as of the completion of the Inoxum Acquisition, except for IT systems that are subject to an agreed transition period. As of the completion of the Inoxum Acquisition, any electronic data stored on the IT systems of Inoxum and ThyssenKrupp was migrated unless such migration would have caused an unreasonable amount of work or costs. In the case of data that the parties agree was not migrated, the parties ensured that an accession right to such electronic data was granted for a transition period of at most two years from the completion of the Inoxum Acquisition.
The Interface Framework Agreement will remain in force despite the overall termination of the Business Combination Agreement and will expire five years after the Inoxum Acquisition Completion Date.
Calvert
Memorandum of Understanding and Service Agreements
In December 2011, ThyssenKrupp Steel USA, LLC ("Steel USA" Outokumpu Stainless USA, LLC) and Stainless USA (Outokumpu Americas, Inc.) entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding interfaces at the Calvert integrated production facility in the United States (the "Calvert MoU"). Stainless USA and Steel USA are reliant upon the joint use of the facilities and infrastructure. The parties agree to conclude contracts based in the principles in the Calvert MoU regarding the following interfaces: real estate and easements, river terminal, roads, rail and site access, utilities power, utilities natural gas, utilities potable water, underground piping systems, storm water, drainage system and structures, industrial gases, emergency services, site security, IT services and infrastructure, waste water treatment plant, and hot rolling (see "--H ot Rolling Agreem ent" below).

Hot Rolling Agreement

In October 2011, Steel USA (Outokumpu Stainless USA, LLC) and Stainless USA (Outokumpu Americas, Inc.) entered into an agreement regarding hot rolling services at the Calvert integrated production facility (the "Calvert HRA"). In February 2014, ThyssenKrupp sold its carbon steel operations at the Calvert site to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation. Steel USA agreed to hot roll slabs provided by Stainless USA to produce stainless steel coils. The Calvert HRA sets forth reserved capacities, for which Stainless USA must pay, subject to certain exceptions, even if it is not used, and maximum capacities, which represent the maximum volume of slabs that Steel USA agreed to process. Steel USA agreed to reserve the necessary processing capacity to produce the reserved capacity and to make available capacity up to the maximum capacity in accordance with the needs of Stainless USA. Upon the request of Stainless USA, Steel USA has the option to agree to process slabs in excess of the maximum capacity.

The following table sets forth the reserved capacity and the maximum capacity for the periods indicated:

_________________________________________________ Reserved Capacity_______Maximum Capacity

1Divided into two six-month periods with a reserved capacity of 356,250 tonnes each. 2Divided into two six-month periods with a maximum capacity of 450,000 tonnes each.

Subject to limited exceptions, Stainless USA's minimum payment (fixed fee) for any period is based on the reserved capacity, even if Steel USA processed less than the reserved capacity. In addition to the fixed fee that is calculated on the basis of the reserved capacity, Stainless USA must pay a variable fee based on the amount of material processed. Beginning in October 2014, the price of hot rolling services under the Calvert HRA is subject to annual adjustment based on the proportion of Stainless USA's use of the Calvert hot rolling mill's capacity to Steel USA's use of such capacity. In addition, the price is subject to monthly adjustment for the cost of labor, materials and utilities as well as for certain other items.

The Calvert HRA will remain in force for 25 years from October 1, 2011 and contains certain customary provisions for termination for cause. For example, the parties may terminate the agreement if the other party commits a material breach of any of its obligations, makes any voluntary arrangement with its creditors or appoints an administrator for purposes of placing itself into insolvency, goes into liquidation, or threatens to cease carrying on its business. If the Calvert HRA is terminated for cause, the terminating party may be entitled to liquidated damages of at least USD 100 million. Termination without cause is not permitted during the first 15 years of the Calvert HRA, after which termination without cause is permitted with a notice period of 36 months.

K refeld

Real Estate Framework Agreement

In December 2011, Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH, ThyssenKrupp Immobilien Verwaltungs GmbH & Co. KG Stahl ("IV") and Thyssen Liegenschaften Verwaltungs- und Verwertungs GmbH & Co. KG Stahl (together with IV, the "Landowners") entered into a framework agreement regarding the reorganization of real estate at the shared Krefeld industrial site as part of the Inoxum Separation (the "Krefeld Real Estate Framework Agreement"). In the Krefeld Real Estate Framework Agreement, Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH and the Landowners irrevocably and mutually offer to conclude the following agreements with each other:

a HBR regarding certain land at the Krefeld industrial site not owned by Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH (see "-- H ereditary Building R ig h t"below);
a lease agreement regarding an office park at the Krefeld industrial site (see "--Office L ease" below); and a lease agreement regarding certain equipment, including rolling gates, a crane, an elevator, a heating system
and fire protection equipment of the office park at the Krefeld industrial site.

166

Hereditary Building Right
Pursuant to the Krefeld Real Estate Framework Agreement, the Landowners made an irrevocable offer to enter into a hereditary building right agreement (the "HBR Agreement") with Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH as freeholder regarding a HBR to certain properties at the Krefeld industrial site in Germany (the "Krefeld HBR"). A HBR is a form of legal estate in land under German law that gives the beneficiary the right to erect, own and use a building on a parcel of land without owning the respective parcel. An HBR can be encumbered with easements and mortgages, subject to the approval of the landowner (if parties have agreed that approval is required), and is freely transferable as if it constituted absolute ownership of the respective parcel of land. Moreover, an HBR persists even if the land is sold by a compulsory sale. Prior to its expiration, an HBR can be cancelled, subject to the statutory and contractual provisions on the return of the HBR to the landowner. If the HBR obligee becomes insolvent, is in delay with at least two annual amounts of the ground rent or violates material obligations under the HBR creation agreement, then the landowner can demand that the HBR be returned (if the parties so agree in the HBR creation agreement). In case of either termination or return of the HBR, the landowner is obliged to pay compensation for the building to the HBR obligee. The compensation amount to be paid to the HBR obligee is subject to the contractual provisions in the HBR creation agreement and can be excluded by the parties.
The purchase price for the existing buildings is EUR 14.4 million and the annual ground rent is approximately EUR 1.65 million, subject to adjustment. Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH is responsible for the real estate transfer tax, which is expected to be approximately EUR 2.2 million. All existing agreements regarding the properties and buildings that are encumbered by the Krefeld HBR will be transferred from the Landowners to Inoxum. Any compensation in case of the return of the buildings payable by the Landowners to Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH has been excluded. Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH will be responsible for the buildings and the properties encumbered by the Krefeld HBR. In addition, Inoxum will be liable for any contamination or preexisting ground contamination, including contamination and pollution caused prior to the creation of the Krefeld HBR, and has to indemnify the Landowners for certain damages from public rulings issued because of disclosed or presumed ground contamination. The HBR Agreement also provides for a reciprocal preemption right (Vorkaufsrecht). Pursuant to German law, the Krefeld HBR must be registered in the first rank in section II in the land register, which will require that all existing easement holders and mortgagees approve the ranking of the Krefeld HBR with higher priority than their own rank in the land register. The Krefeld HBR will have a fixed term of 99 years commencing on the date of its registration in the land register and cannot be unilaterally terminated for convenience or cause.
Office Lease
Pursuant to the Krefeld Real Estate Framework Agreement, the Landowners and Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH entered into a lease for indoor and outdoor space used by Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH as offices, archives, canteen, warehouse, laboratory, car park or for agricultural use (the "Krefeld Office Lease Agreement"). The leased premises include an office park of 12,633 square meters as well as hall areas, canteen space, parking spaces and agricultural space. The total monthly rent is approximately EUR 227,000 (including expenses and VAT), subject to adjustment. Pursuant to the Krefeld Office Lease Agreement, Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH must remove all constructional alterations and all fixtures installed by it at the end of the lease without compensation. Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH is also liable for all maintenance and repairs within the leased premises. Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH has been operating at the site for years and, therefore, is ultimately liable for any contamination or pollution affecting the land and buildings. The Krefeld Office Lease Agreement will be valid for 30 years and cannot be terminated for convenience or cause.
O STP Joint Venture Agreem ents
In September 2011, Outokumpu Stainless Steel Oy (currently Outokumpu EMEA Oy) and Tubinoxia entered into the share purchase agreement whereby Tubinoxia purchased a 36 percent share in Outokumpu Stainless Tubular Products business to form the OSTP JV. At the same time, Outokumpu and Tubinoxia entered into the shareholders' agreement.
As at the date of this Prospectus, Tubinoxia owns 51 percent of the shares in the OSTP JV since Tubinoxia exercised its option to acquire an additional 15 percent of the shares in January 2013. Outokumpu will continue to be the primary supplier of raw materials to the OSTP JV. Outokumpu financed the turnaround plan announced
167

in 2011, which included impairments, restructuring costs and financing of operations (i.e., losses and working capital needs). As Outokumpu is now a minority shareholder, it will no longer give additional financing to the OSTP JV. According to the OSTP JV's corporate strategy and plans to improve the company's performance, focus will be on process pipes and butt-weld fittings, consolidating the company's production structure and reducing costs by streamlining its organization.
The OSTP JV is managed by a board of directors consisting of four directors. The majority shareholder appoints three members of the board of directors and the minority member appoints one member of the board of directors. Certain matters must be approved by both Outokumpu and Tubinoxia. Outokumpu also produces pipes at its Wildwood tubular products production facility in Florida, United States, which is not part of the OSTP JV.
Shareholder A greem ent between the Shareholders o f Voimaosakeyhtio SF
In February 2014, Outokumpu Oyj entered into a shareholder agreement among the shareholders of Voimaosakeyhtio SF, which owns a share in Fennovoima, which was granted a decision-in-principle by the Government of Finland to build a new nuclear power plant in Finland. In August 2015, Outokumpu agreed to increase its share in Voimaosakeyhtio SF by 1.8 percentage points. Outokumpu's indirect interest in Fennovoima is approximately 14 percent. When operational, shareholders in Fennovoima will be able to procure electricity at cost against payment of their pro rata share of operating expenses of the power plant (so-called "Mankala" principle).
M anga LN G Joint Venture A greem ent
In December 2014 Outokumpu and three other companies entered into agreements regarding the incorporation of a joint venture company Manga LNG Oy to build and operate a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at Tornio Harbor and procure LNG for its owners. Outokumpu invests approximately EUR 30 million into using LNG at Tornio mill instead of propane gas. The vast majority of the investment, phased over the years from 2015 to 2018, is used to proceed with the required equipment modifications at the Tornio mill. Outokumpu's share of Manga LNG Oy is 45 percent as at May 31, 2016. The owners of Manga LNG Oy have entered into shareholders' agreement regarding the ownership and governance of Manga LNG Oy and its subsidiary, and into take-or-pay agreements regarding the supply of LNG the shareholders and, into other customary agreements relating to the company.
Equity Transfer A greem ent R egarding Shanghai Krupp Stainless Co., Ltd. (SKS)
In October 2015 Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH signed an agreement with LTC, regarding Shanghai Krupp Stainless Co., Ltd. (SKS) in China. SKS is a Shanghai-based joint venture between Outokumpu and Baosteel, who have held 60 and 40 percent respectively. According to the agreement, Outokumpu agreed to divest 55 percent of SKS shares to LTC. Outokumpu Nirosta GmbH has subsequently agreed with LTC that it will sell its remaining 5 percent share in SKS to LTC and the operations of SKS will be stopped. The final terms and conditions regarding the sale of the 5 percent share were agreed in May 2015. According to the agreement, LTV will pay the final payment in three installments. The closing of the transaction is expected during the fourth quarter of 2016 after receiving the final installment. Until then, Outokumpu remains a minority shareholder with a 5 percent share in SKS. In the agreements Outokumpu gave customary representations and warranties to LTC and is liable for to indemnify LTC from and against any and all losses, claims, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses arising from or in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of the representations or warranties or breach of any transaction document.
Share Sale and Purchase A greem ent regarding Fischer M exicana
In September 2015 Outokumpu entered into a share sale and purchase agreement with F.E.R. Fischer Edelstahlrohre GmbH ("Fischer") regarding Fischer Mexicana, the joint venture between these two companies, whereupon Outokumpu agreed to divest to Fischer its 50 percent stake in the joint venture for USD 63 million. Outokumpu completed the transaction in December 2015. In the share sale and purchase agreement Outokumpu gave customary representations and warranties to Fischer regarding the shares and Fischer Mexicana.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND PROSPECTS
Historical financial information
The audited consolidated financial statements of Outokumpu as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU. The audited consolidated financial statements of Outokumpu as at and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 have been incorporated into this Prospectus by reference. See "Information Incorporated by Reference". Except for the two financial statements mentioned above, the information included in this Prospectus has not been audited.
The unaudited condensed interim financial statements as at and for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and comparative information for the three months ended March 31, 2015 have not been prepared in accordance with "IAS 34--Interim Financial Reporting". As of the first quarter of 2016, Outokumpu has applied reduced reporting requirements of the Finnish Securities Market Act and the first and third quarter reports will no longer cover the full extent of the "IAS 34--Interim Financial Reporting" standard. Outokumpu continues to disclose all the relevant information in its quarterly reporting.
No significant change in the Issuer's financial or trading position
There has been no significant change in the financial or trading position of the Issuer and the Guarantors since March 31, 2016.
Prospects
In its stock exchange release dated April 27, 2016, Outokumpu published the following information on its business and financial outlook for the second quarter of 2016:
"Outokumpu expects that the stainless steel market conditions will continue to be challenging in the second quarter amid global economic uncertainties and subdued raw material prices. In Europe, the underlying demand in key sectors outside of Oil and Gas is expected to continue healthy but stock levels among distributors are still above historical averages. Market dynamics in Americas are showing some improvement: stock levels among distributors have come down, price increases have been announced and Chinese imports are being addressed with antidumping investigation.
Market uncertainties warrant prudence in the outlook statement for the second quarter. While steady progress in stainless business is expected, results will be burdened by weaker performance of the ferrochrome business driven by low ferrochrome price and USD/EUR exchange rate. Outokumpu expects its delivery volumes to be sequentially flat and the underlying EBIT to remain at a similar level as in the first quarter. With current prices, the net impact of raw material-related inventory and metal derivative gains/losses on profitability is expected to be marginal, if any.
Outokumpu is finalizing plans for the announced EUR 100 million reduction in its SG&A costs and estimates to book approximately EUR 40 million of redundancy provisions in the second quarter, out of which approximately EUR 5 million is expected to be cash effective during the quarter.
This outlook reflects the current scope of operations."
There have been no material adverse changes in the prospects of the Issuer and the Guarantors since the date of their last published audited financial statements.

TAXATION The following is a general description addressing only the Finnish withholding tax treatment of income arising from the Notes. This summary is based on the laws and regulations in full force and effect in Finland as at the date of this Prospectus, which may be subject to change in the future, potentially with retroactive effect. Investors should be aware that the comments below are of a general nature and do not constitute legal or tax advice and should not be understood as such. The comments below relate only to the position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of the Notes. Prospective investors are therefore advised to consult their own qualified advisors so as to determine, in the light of their individual situation, the tax consequences of the acquisition, holding, redemption, sale or other disposition of the Notes. Non-resident holders of Notes Payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer to persons not resident in Finland for tax purposes and who do not engage in trade or business through a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business in Finland may be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Republic of Finland or by any municipality or other political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein. Resident holders of the Notes
Corporates
Payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer to corporates resident in Finland for tax purposes may be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Republic of Finland or by any municipality or other political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.
Individuals and estates
Payments made under the Notes should not be subject to withholding according to the Act on Withholding on Interest Income (Laki korkotulon lahdeverosta 1341/1990, as amended). Payments of interest or interest compensation (secondary market compensation, in Finnish "jalkimarkkinahyvitys") made to individuals or estates are generally subject to advance withholding of income tax according to the Prepayment Act (Ennakkoperintalaki 1118/1996, as amended). The withholding liability should primarily lie with a possible paying agent or other intermediary (such as a financial institution) effecting the payment to the Noteholder, if the paying agent or intermediary is resident in Finland for tax purposes or the payment is made through a Finnish permanent establishment of a non-resident paying agent or intermediary.
