Funds that the Agent receives on account of the Holders in connection with the termination  of the Bonds or the enforcement of any or all of the Transaction Security constitute escrow  funds (Sw. redovisningsmedel) according to the Escrow Funds Act (Sw. lag (1944:181) om  redovisningsmedel) and must be held on a separate interest-bearing account on behalf of the  Holders and any other interested party. The Agent shall promptly arrange for payments to be  made to the Holders in such case. The Agent shall arrange for payments of such funds in  accordance with Clause 16 (Distribution of proceeds) as soon as reasonably practicable. If  the Agent deems it appropriate, it may, 1n accordance with Clause 5.9, instruct the CSD to  arrange for payment to the Holders.

To the extent permissible by law, the  powers set out in this Clause 5.9 are irrevocable and shall be valid for as long as any Bonds  remain outstanding. The Issuer shall immediately upon request by the Agent provide the  Agent with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and  substance to the Agent's satisfaction), which the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of  carrying out its duties under Clause 5.8.

By acquiring Bonds, each  subsequent Holder confirms such appointment and authorisation for the Agent to act on its  behalf.

<<<

Each Holder shall immediately upon request by the Agent provide the Agent with any such  documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance satisfactory to the  Agent), as the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying  out its duties under the Finance Documents. The Agent is under no obligation to represent a  Holder which does not comply with such request.

<<<

The Agent shall upon request by a Holder disclose the identity of any other Holder who has  consented to the Agent in doing so.

<<<

The Agent shall, subject to Clause 25.2.2, be entitled to disclose to the Holders any event or  circumstance directly or indirectly relating to the Issuer or the Bonds.

The Issuer shall on demand by the Agent pay all costs for external  experts engaged (1) after the occurrence of an Event of Default, (11) for the purpose of  investigating or considering an event which the Agent reasonably believes is or may lead to  an Event of Default or a matter relating to the Issuer which the Agent reasonably believes  may be detrimental to the interests of the Holders under the Finance Documents or (111) when

<<<

Any compensation for  damages or other recoveries received by the Agent from external experts engaged by it for  the purpose of carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents shall be distributed in  accordance with Clause 16 (Distribution of proceeds).

<<<

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Finance Documents to the contrary, the Agent 1s  not obligated to do or omit to do anything if it would or might in its reasonable opinion  constitute a breach of any law or regulation.

<<<

If in the Agent's reasonable opinion the cost, loss or liability which it may incur (including  reasonable fees to the Agent) in complying with instructions of the Holders, or taking any  action at its own initiative, will not be covered by the Issuer, the Agent may refrain from  acting in accordance with such instructions, or taking such action, until it has received such  funding or indemnities (or adequate security has been provided therefore) as it may  reasonably require.

<<<

The Agent shall give a notice to the Holders (1) before it ceases to perform its obligations  under the Finance Documents by reason of the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or  indemnity due to the Agent under the Finance Documents, or (11) if it refrains from acting for  any reason described in Clause 21.2.9.

<<<

<<<

The Agent shall not be liable for any delay (or any related consequences) in crediting an  account with an amount required pursuant to the Finance Documents to be paid by the Agent  to the Holders, provided that the Agent has taken all necessary steps as soon as reasonably  practicable to comply with the regulations or operating procedures of any recognised  clearing or settlement system used by the Agent for that purpose.

The Issuer may, at a Holders' Meeting convened by it or by way of  Written Procedure initiated by it, propose to the Holders that the Agent be dismissed and a  new Agent appointed.

<<<

If the Holders have not appointed a successor Agent within ninety (90) calendar days after  (1) the earlier of the notice of resignation was given or the resignation otherwise took place,  or (11) the Agent was dismissed through a decision by the Holders, the Issuer shall appoint a  successor Agent which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable  company which regularly acts as agent under debt issuances.

Upon the appointment of a successor, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from any further  obligation in respect of the Finance Documents but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the  Finance Documents and remain liable under the Finance Documents in respect of any action  which it took or failed to take whilst acting as Agent. Its successor, the Issuer and each of the  Holders shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves under the Finance  Documents as they would have had if such successor had been the original Agent.

<<<

In the event that there 1s a change of the Agent in accordance with this Clause 21.4, the  Issuer shall execute such documents and take such actions as the new Agent may reasonably  require for the purpose of vesting in such new Agent the rights, powers and obligation of the  Agent and releasing the retiring Agent from its further obligations under the Finance  Documents. Unless the Issuer and the new Agent agrees otherwise, the new Agent shall be  entitled to the same fees and the same indemnities as the retiring Agent.

<<<

Clause 23.1 shall not apply if the Agent has been instructed by the Holders in accordance  with the Finance Documents to take certain actions but fails for any reason to take, or is  unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a Holder to provide documents in  accordance with Clause 21.1.2), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such  failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by  the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under the Finance  Documents or by any reason described in Clause 21.2.9, such failure must continue for at  least forty (40) Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 21.2.10 before a Holder may  take any action referred to in Clause 23.1.

<<<

The provisions of Clause 23.1 shall not in any way limit an individual Holder's right to  claim and enforce payments which are due to it under Clause 11.4 (Mandatory repurchase  due to a Change of Control Event (put option)) or other payments which are due by the  Issuer to some but not all Holders.
