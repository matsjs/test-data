Each Holder is bound by the Finance Documents without there being any further actions  required to be taken or formalities to be complied with.

<<<

<<<

Subject to Clause 7 (Right of First Refusal), the Bonds are freely transferable. All Bond  transfers are subject to the Finance Documents and the Finance Documents are automatically  applicable in relation to all Bond transferees upon completed transfer.

<<<

Upon a transfer of Bonds, any rights and obligations under the Finance Documents relating to  such Bonds are automatically transferred to the transferee.

<<<

No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public  offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other  material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden, where action  for that purpose is required. Each Holder must inform itself about, and observe, any applicable  restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds, (due to, e.g., its  nationality, its residency, its registered address or its place(s) of business). Each Holder must  ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.

<<<

The Bonds have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  "Securities Act") and the Issuer is under no obligation to arrange for registration of the Bonds  under the Securities Act or under any other law or regulation. The Bonds may not be offered,  sold or delivered within the United States of America or to, or for the account or benefit of,  U.S. persons.

<<<

such Subsequent Bonds may be purchased by an Eligible Institution; and

<<<

a Transferring Holder may transfer Bonds to a Person which is not an Affilate  of such Transferring Holder,

<<<

provided that:

<<<

A) in respect of a transfer pursuant to paragraph (b) above, the Issuing  Agent has been notified by the Transferring Holder of the proposed  transfer;

<<<

C) each Accepting Underwriter has further been offered the opportunity  by the Issuer or the Transferring Holder (as applicable) to assume the  Declined Amounts in an amount pro rata to its share of 1t then current  Nominal Amount of Bonds held by Accepting Underwriter (taking into  account the Nominal Amount of Bonds assumed by them pursuant to  sub-paragraph (1) above) and has not accepted such offer within a  further five (5) Business Days from the date of such offer; and

<<<

D) if, following application of sub-paragraphs (B) and (C) above, any  amount of the Bonds has not been purchased by the Underwriters (any  such amounts not assumed by Accepting Underwriters being the  "Residual Amount'), each Holder (save for an Underwriter) has been  offered the opportunity by the Issuer or the Transferring Holder (as  applicable) to purchase an amount of such Residual Amount pro rata  to its share of the then current aggregate Nominal Amount of Bonds  (excluding the Nominal Amount of Bonds held by any Underwriter  (taking into account the Nominal Amount of Bonds assumed by them  pursuant to sub-paragraphs (B) and (C) above)) and has not accepted  such offer within ten (10) Business Days from the date of such offer.

<<<

Provided that the procedures set out in Clause 7.1 have been adhered to:

<<<

a) any Subsequent Bonds not purchased by existing Holders may be sold to an Eligible  Institution; and

<<<

b) a Transferring Holder may transfer Bonds not purchased by existing Holders to an  Eligible Institution.

<<<

Any Person which acquires Bonds in violation of the terms and procedures set out in  Clause 7.1 shall promptly offer the Holders (excluding any Holder which have acquired Bonds  in violation of Clause 7.1) to purchase such acquired Bonds in accordance with the procedures  set out in Clause 7.1.

<<<

The Nominal Amount held by any Person which acquires Bonds in violation of the terms and  procedures set out in Clause 7.1 shall be disregarded when ascertaining any requisite majority  of Holders under the Finance Documents.
