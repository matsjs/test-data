The price of the Subsequent Bonds may be set at a discount or at a  premium compared to the Nominal Amount.

<<<

The Bonds are freely transferable but the Bondholders may be subject to purchase or  transfer restrictions with regard to the Bonds, as applicable, under local laws to which a  Bondholder may be subject. Each Bondholder must ensure compliance with such  restrictions at its own cost and expense.

<<<

No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or 1s intended to permit a public  offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or  other material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden,  where action for that purpose 1s required.
