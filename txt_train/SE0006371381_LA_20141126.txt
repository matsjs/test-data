CONTRACT (RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES) ACT 1999

<<<

No person (other than (1) the Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and (11) the  Senior Finance Parties and Hedging Counterparties (as such terms are defined in the  Intercreditor Agreement) acting through agents or trustees, where applicable) shall have  any right to enforce any term or condition of the Notes under the Contracts (Rights of  Third Parties) Act 1999 except and to the extent, if any, that the Notes expressly provide  for such Act to apply to any of their terms. This does not affect any right or remedy of a  third party which exists or 1s available apart from that Act.

<<<

GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

<<<

The Trust Deed (including the Guarantee) and the Notes, and any non-contractual  obligations arising out of or in connection therewith, shall be governed by and construed in  accordance with English law.

<<<

Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors has in the Trust Deed agreed for the benefit of the  Trustee and the Noteholders that the English courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction in  relation to all disputes arising out of or in connection with the Trust Deed or the Notes  (including claims for set-off and counterclaims), including, without limitation, disputes  arising out of or in connection with: (1) the creation, validity, effect, interpretation,  performance or non-performance of, or the legal relationships established by the Trust  Deed and the Notes; and (11) any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection  with the Trust Deed and the Notes and accordingly submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of  the English courts. For such purposes each of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee  irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts and waives any objection to  the exercise of such jurisdiction.

<<<

LON33163840/1   27.3 Notwithstanding that, under the Financial Instruments Accounts Act or the operating  procedures, rules and regulations of the CSD, (together, the "Swedish Remedies'), holders  of the Notes may have remedies against the Issuer and/or a Guarantor for non-payment or  non-performance under the Trust Deed and the Notes, a Noteholder must first exhaust all  available remedies in the courts of England and Wales for non-payment or non-  performance before any proceedings may be brought against the Issuer and/or a Guarantor,  in Sweden 1n respect of the Swedish Remedies. Notwithstanding the above, and in this  limited respect only, a Noteholder may not therefore take concurrent proceedings in  Sweden.

<<<

The Issuer and each Guarantor:

<<<

a) waives any objection to the choice of or submission to the English courts on the  grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise as regards proceedings in connection  with the Trust Deed and the Notes or any non-contractual obligations arising out of  or in connection with the Trust Deed and the Notes; and

<<<

b) agrees that a judgment, declaration or order (whether interim or final) of an  English court in connection with the Trust Deed and the Notes or any non-  contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the Trust Deed and the  Notes 1s conclusive and binding on it and may be enforced against it in the courts  of any other jurisdiction.

<<<

To the extent permitted by law, the Trustee and the Noteholders may take any suit, action  or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the Trust Deed and the Notes against the  Issuer and the Guarantors in any other court of competent jurisdiction.

<<<

The Issuer and each Guarantor shall at all times maintain an agent for service of process  and any other documents in proceedings in England in connection with this Trust Deed.  Any writ, judgment or other notice of legal process shall be sufficiently served on the  Issuer and each Guarantor if delivered to such agent at its address for the time being. The  Issuer and each Guarantor undertakes with the Trustee not to revoke the authority of the  above agent without the prior wntten consent of the Trustee.

<<<

If, for any reason, the Trustee requests the Issuer and each Guarantor, to do so, the Issuer  and each Guarantor shall promptly appoint another such agent with an address in England  and shall advise the Trustee of such new appointment. If, following such a request the  Issuer and each Guarantor fails to appoint another agent, the Trustee shall be entitled to  appoint such an agent on behalf of the Issuer and each Guarantor. The Trustee shall notify  the Issuer of the identity of such appointee as soon as reasonably practicable after the  relevant date of appointment.

<<<

The Issuer agrees that failure by a process agent (howsoever appointed) to notify the Issuer  of the process will not invalidate the proceedings concemed.

<<<

For the avoidance of doubt, both the Issuing Agent and Escrow Agent are intended by the  parties to this Agreement to have the right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act  1999 to enforce the terms of Condition 4.2 (Conditions Precedent).
