accordance with a guarantee issued by the Guarantor in favour of the Agent and each Holder  (as represented by the Agent) (the "Guarantee'). The obligations and liabilities of the  guarantee issued by the Guarantor under the Guarantee shall be limited if required (but only  if and to the extent required) under the laws of Malta, being the jurisdiction in which the  Guarantor 1s incorporated.

<<<

The Issuer shall ensure that the Guarantee and all documents relating thereto are duly  executed in favour of the Agent and the Holders (as represented by the Agent) and that such  documents are legally valid, perfected, enforceable and in full force and effect according to  their terms. The Issuer shall execute and/or procure the execution of such further  documentation as the Agent may reasonably require in order for the Holders and the Agent  to at all times maintain the guarantee position envisaged under the Finance Documents.

<<<

Except if otherwise decided by the Holders according to the procedures set out in Clauses 17  (Decisions by Holders), 18 (Holders' Meeting) and 19 (Written Procedure), the Agent 1s,  without first having to obtain the Holders' consent, entitled to enter into binding agreements  with the Group Companies or third parties if it is, m the Agent's sole discretion, necessary  for the purpose of establishing, maintaining, altering, releasing or enforcing the Guarantee or  for the purpose of settling the various Holders' relative nghts to the Guarantee. The Agent is  entitled to take all measures available to it according to the Guarantee.

<<<

If the Bonds are declared due and payable according to Clause 15 (Jermination of the  Bonds) (or an Event of Default according to Clause 15.1 (a) (Non-payment) has occurred and  is continuing), or following the Final Redemption Date, the Agent 1s, without first having to  obtain the Holders' consent, entitled to enforce the Guarantee in such manner and under such  conditions that the Agent finds acceptable (if in accordance with the Guarantee).

<<<

If a Holders' Meeting has been convened, or a Written Procedure has been instigated, to  decide on the termination of the Bonds and/or the enforcement of the Guarantee, the Agent  is obligated to take actions in accordance with the Holders' decision regarding the  Guarantee. However, if the Bonds are not terminated due to that the cause for termination  has ceased or due to any other circumstance mentioned in these Terms and Conditions, the  Agent shall not enforce the Guarantee. If the Holders, without any prior initiative from the  Agent or the Issuer, have made a decision regarding termination of the Bonds and  enforcement of the Guarantee in accordance with the procedures set out in Clauses 17  (Decisions by Holders), 18 (Holders' Meeting) and 19 (Written Procedure), the Agent shall  promptly declare the Bonds terminated and enforce the Guarantee. The Agent is however not  liable to take action if the Agent considers cause for termination and/or acceleration not to be  at hand, unless the instructing Holders in writing commit to holding the Agent indemnified  and, at the Agent's own discretion, grant sufficient security for the obligation.

To the extent permissible by law, the powers set out  in this Clause 5.7 are irrevocable and shall be valid for as long as any Bonds remain  outstanding. The Issuer shall immediately upon request by the Agent provide the Agent with  any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance to the  Agent's satisfaction), which the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of carrying out its  duties under Clause 5.6 (including as required by the CSD in order for the CSD to accept  such payment instructions). Especially, the Issuer shall, upon the Agent's request, provide  the Agent with a written power of attorney empowering the Agent to change the bank  account registered with the CSD to a bank account in the name of the Agent and to instruct  the CSD to pay out funds originating from an enforcement in accordance with Clause 5.6 to  the Holders through the CSD.

Each Holder must inform itself about, and observe, any  applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds, (due to,  e.g., its nationality, its residency, its registered address or its place(s) of business). Existing  Bondholders may be restricted to participate in the Exchange Offer if they are not cligible  purchasers and/or if they are subject to transfer restrictions. Each Holder must ensure  compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.
