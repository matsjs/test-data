STATUS OF THE BONDS

<<<

The Bonds are denominated in Swedish Kronor and cach Bond is constituted by these  Terms and Conditions. The Issuer undertakes to make payments in relation to the Bonds  and to comply with these Terms and Conditions.

<<<

By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Bondholder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from  and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Bonds, each subsequent  Bondholder confirms such agreement.

<<<

The nominal amount of each Bond is SEK 1,000,000 (the "Initial Nominal Amount').  The maximum aggregate nominal amount of the Initial Bonds as of the First Issue Date is  SEK 1,500,000,000. All Initial Bonds are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of  one hundred (100.00) per cent. of the Nominal Amount.

<<<

The Issuer may, on one or several occasions, provided that (1) no Event of Default 1s  continuing or would result from such issue and (11) the Incurrence Test is met, issuc  Subsequent Bonds amounting to SEK 500,000,000. Subsequent Bonds may be issued to  par or above or below par. The Subsequent Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the  Finance Documents, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate, the  currency, the nominal amount and the final maturity applicable to the Initial Bonds shall  apply to Subsequent Bonds. The Total Nominal Amount of the Bonds (the Initial Bonds  and all Subsequent Bonds) may not exceed SEK 2,000,000,000 unless a consent from the  Bondholders is obtained in accordance with Clause 15.7. Each Subsequent Bond shall  entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with Clause 8.1, and otherwise have the same  rights as the Initial Bonds.

<<<

The Bonds constitute direct, general, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured  obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank at least pari passu with all other direct,  unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer, except those  obligations which are mandatorily preferred by law, and without any preference among  them.

<<<

The Bonds are freely transferable but the Bondholders may be subject to purchase or  transfer restrictions with regard to the Bonds, as applicable from time to time under local  laws to which a Bondholder may be subject (due to e.g. the Bondholders nationality,  residency, registered address or place(s) of business). Each Bondholder must ensure  compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.

<<<

No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public  offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or  other material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden,   12(35)

<<<

where action for that purpose 1s required. Each Bondholder must inform itself about, and  observe, any applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the  Bonds.

<<<

USE OF PROCEEDS  The Issuer shall use the Net Proceeds from the issue of the Initial Bonds for the purpose of  facilitating the Issuer's acquisition strategy, including the acquisition of the Mikla Group,

<<<

refinancing of existing debt and for general corporate purposes of the Group.

The Issuer shall use the Net Proceeds from the issue of any Subsequent Bonds for general  corporate purposes of the Group, including acquisitions.
