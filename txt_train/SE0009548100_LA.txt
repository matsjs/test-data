If the Holders vote in  favour of termination and instruct the Agent to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall  promptly declare the Bonds terminated. However, if the cause for termination according to  the Agent's appraisal has ceased before the termination, the Agent shall not terminate the  Bonds. The Agent shall in such case, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that the  cause for termination has ceased. The Agent shall always be entitled to take the time  necessary to consider whether an occurred event constitutes an Event of Default.

<<<
