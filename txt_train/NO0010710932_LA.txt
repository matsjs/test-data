<<<

The interest charged under this Clause 11.5 shall be added to the defaulted amount on  each respective Interest Payment Date relating thereto until the defaulted amount has  been repaid in full.

<<<

The unpaid amounts shall bear interest as stated above until payment is made, whether or  not the Bonds are declared to be in default pursuant to Clause 15.1(a), cf. Clauses 15.2 -  15.4.
