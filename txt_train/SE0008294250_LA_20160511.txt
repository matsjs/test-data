STATUS OF THE BONDS

<<<

The Bonds are denominated in Swedish Kronor and each Bond is constituted by these  Terms and Conditions. The Issuer undertakes to make payments in relation to the Bonds  and to comply with these Terms and Conditions.

<<<

<<<

The nominal amount of each Bond is SEK 1,000,000 (the "Nominal Amount"). All Initia!  Bonds are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of hundred per cent of the Nominal  Amount.

<<<

Provided that no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue, the Issuer  may, at one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Bonds. Subsequent Bonds shall  benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt,  the ISIN, the interest rate, the Nominal Amount and the Final Maturity Date applicable to  the Initial Bonds shall apply to Subsequent Bonds. The price of the Subsequent Bonds may  be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal Amount. Each Subsequent  Bond shall entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with Clause 8.1, and otherwise have  the same rights as the Initial Bonds.

<<<

The Bonds constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of  the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu and without any preference among them,  and at least pari passu with all other direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured  obligations of the Issuer other than those mandatorily preferred by law.  f HW

The Bonds are freely transferable but the Bondholders may be subject to purchase or  transfer restrictions with regard to the Bonds, as applicable, under local laws to which a  Bondholder may be subject. Each Bondholder must ensure compliance with such  restrictions at its own cost and expense.

<<<

No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public  offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or  other material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden,  where action for that purpose is required. Each Bondholder must inform itself about, and  observe, any applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the  Bonds.

<<<

USE OF PROCEEDS

<<<

The Issuer shall use the proceeds from the issue of the Bonds, less the costs and expenses  incurred by the Issuer in connection with the issue of the Bonds, for repayment of the  Issuer's outstanding bonds maturing on 30 May 2016 and for general corporate purposes  for the Group including acquisitions and intra-group lending.

<<<

lf a Bondholder has registered, through an Account Operator, that principal and interest  shall be deposited in a certain bank account, such deposits will be effected by the CSD on  the relevant payment date. In other cases, payments will be transferred by the CSD to the  Bondholder at the address registered with the CSD on the Record Date. Should the CSD,  due to a delay on behalf of the Issuer or some other obstacle, not be able to effect  payments as aforesaid, the Issuer shall procure that such amounts are paid to the persons  who are registered as Bondholders on the relevant Record Date as soon as possible after  such obstacle has been removed.
