The price of  the Subsequent Bonds may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to  the Nominal Amount. Each Subsequent Bond shall entitle its holder to Interest  in accordance with Clause 8(a), and otherwise have the same rights as the  Initial Bonds   3.

<<<

f) The Bonds constitute direct, general, unconditional, unsubordinated and  secured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu with (i)  the Super Senior Debt and the New Debt pursuant to the Intercreditor  Agreement, but will following an Enforcement Action (as defined in the  Intercreditor Agreement) receive proceeds distributable by the Security Agent  only after the Super Senior Debt has been repaid in full, and (ii) all direct,  unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer, except  those obligations which are mandatorily preferred by law, and without any  preference among them.
