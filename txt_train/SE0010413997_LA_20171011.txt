The maximum aggregate nominal amount of the Initial Notes as at the First  Issue Date 1s EUR 310,000,000. All Initial Notes are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue  price of 100 per cent. of the Initial Nominal Amount.

The  issue price of the Subsequent Notes may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to  the Nominal Amount. The maximum aggregate nominal amount of the Notes (the Initial  Notes and all Subsequent Notes) may not exceed EUR 400,000,000 unless a consent from  the Noteholders is obtained in accordance with Clause 18.7(a). Each Subsequent Note shall  entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with Clause 10.1, and otherwise have the same  rights as the Initial Notes.

<<<

In case of insolvency of the Issuer, the payment obligations of the Issuer under the Notes  are subordinated to other payment obligations of the Issuer under the RCF, PIL and any  Permitted Hedging Obligations in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

<<<
