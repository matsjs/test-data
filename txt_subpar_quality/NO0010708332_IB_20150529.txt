Report of the auditor to the Board of Directors of Jacob Holm & Sons AG Basel
Report of the auditor on the consolidated financial statements On your instructions, we have audited the consolidated financial statements of Jacob Holm & Sons AG, which comprise the balance sheet, income statement, statement of comprehensive income, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity and notes, for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 give a true and fair view of the financial position, the results of operations and the cash flows in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies The Annual Report of Jacob Holm & Sons AG for 2014 is prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Annual Report for 2014 is presented in CHF '000. The applied accounting policies are unchanged compared to the previous year. First time adoption of IFRS This is the first annual report prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Group has been established in 2014. Therefore, the Group did not prepare consolidated financial statements in prior years. Effect of IFRS is described in note 2 in Notes to the Annual Report, Group and note 1 in Notes to the Annual Report, Parent Company. New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the Group The following standards, which are relevant to the Group have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2014: Amendment to IAS 32, `Financial instruments, introduces further guidance on when offsetting is allowed. Amendments to IAS 36, `Impairment of assets', on the recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets. This amendment removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of CGUs which had been included in IAS 36 by the issue of IFRS 13. IFRIC 21, `Levies', sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy that is not income tax. The interpretation addresses what the obligating event is that gives rise to pay a levy and when should a liability be recognised. The Group is not currently subjected to significant levies so the impact on the Group is not material. New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2014, and have not been applied in preparing the consolidated financial statement. IFRS 9, `Financial instruments', addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. Reduces the number of categories of financial assets to two; amortised cost and fair value. In cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity's own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement. Furthermore, hedge accounting is simplified and net positions can be hedged.

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies (continued) IFRS 15, `Revenue from contracts with customers' deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 `Revenue' and IAS 11 `Construction contracts' and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and earlier application is permitted. The group is assessing the impact of IFRS 15.
The IASB has approved further new standards and interpretations that are not relevant to Jacob Holm & Sons AG and will have no effect on the Financial Statements.
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Parent Company Jacob Holm & Sons AG and group companies in which the Parent Company holds more than 50% of the share capital.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the basis of the Financial Statements of the Parent Company and the group companies by combining items of a uniform nature, and elimination is made of intercompany income and expenses, intercompany accounts as well as profits and losses on transactions between the consolidated companies. The results of foreign group companies are translated into Swiss Franc at average exchange rates. The balance sheets are translated into Swiss Franc at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Exchange adjustments in this connection are made over the statement of comprehensive income.
Business combinations On acquisition of subsidiaries including acquisition of subsidiaries under common control, the purchase method is applied.
Purchase price of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially measured at fair value at the time of acquisition. Identifiable intangible fixed assets are recognised if they can be separated and the fair value can be measured reliably. Deferred tax is recognised on remeasurements made. Any remaining positive differences between the cost and the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are recognised in intangible fixed assets in the balance sheet as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis.
Acquired companies are recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the time when control is achieved, while sold companies are recognised until the time of surrender of control.
Profit or loss on the sale of subsidiaries are calculated as the difference between the selling price net of selling expenses and the carrying amount of net assets with addition of goodwill and accumulated exchange adjustments recognised in equity at the time of sale.
10

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies (continued) Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recognised at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Exchange differences arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the rates at the dates of payment are recognised in financial income and expenses in the income statement.
Receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Differences between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the rates at the time of the establishment of the receivable or payable or recognition in the most recent Financial Statements are recognised in financial income and expenses in the income statement.
Balance sheet items including goodwill for consolidated companies that do not have CHF as their functional currency are translated into CHF at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date, whereas the income statements of these companies are translated at average exchange rates for the month. Exchange adjustments arising on the translation of the opening equity at year-end rates and net profit for the year at year-end rates are recognised directly in equity under a separate reserve for exchange adjustments.
Income Statement
Revenue and recognition of income Revenue consists of the fair value of goods sold excluding VAT and net of provisions for returns, discounts, etc.
Income is recognised when realised or realisable and earned. Income from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the sale is considered effected based on the following criteria:
 delivery has been made before year end;
 a binding sales agreement has been made;
 the sales price has been determined; and payment has been received or may with reasonable certainty be expected to be received.
Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, etc, as well as operation, administration and management of factories and distribution expenses including salaries to distribution staff.
Cost of goods sold also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisation as well as amortisation of capitalised development costs.
11

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies (continued) Sales and marketing expenses Sales and marketing expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles, depreciation, etc. Administrative expenses Administrative expenses comprise expenses for Management, administrative staff, office expenses, depreciation, etc. Other operating income and expenses Other operating income and other operating expenses comprise items of a secondary nature to the core activities of the companies, including gains and losses on disposals of intangible fixed assets and property, plant and equipment as well as subsidies received which do not directly relate to the purchase of non-current assets. Special items Special items comprise income and expenses outside normal operations which are at the same time non-recurring income and expenses. Financial income and expenses Financial income and expenses comprise interest, financial expenses in respect of finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange adjustments, price adjustment of securities and amortisation of financial assets and liabilities. Financial expenses directly attributable to purchases, construction or production of a qualifying asset are included as part of the expenses relating to the asset. All other financial expenses are recognised in expenses in the financial year in which they were incurred. A qualifying asset is an asset for which considerable time is required to make it ready for its intended use or for sale. Tax on profit for the year Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and deferred tax for the year. The tax attributable to the profit for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement.

1 Accounting Policies (continued)
Balance Sheet

Intangible fixed assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of identifiable net assets of the acquired enterprise. Goodwill is measured at historical cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the Group's operating segments. The allocation is completed no later than at the end of the reporting period following the acquisition.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or on indication of impairment In the event of impairment, the carrying amount is written down to the value in use. Impairment charges on goodwill are not reversed.

Customer lists, know-how, patents and licenses, trademarks and software are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is made on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life, which are;

Customer lists, know-how, patents and licenses 3-10 years

Trademarks

20 years

Software

3-5 years

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and less any accumulated impairment losses.

Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and expenses directly related to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost comprises direct and indirect expenses for labour, materials, components and sub-suppliers. Income from the sale of products during a possible run-in period until the asset is fully ready for use is set off against the cost of the asset.

State subsidies received are set off against the cost of assets qualifying for the subsidy.

Financial expenses directly attributable to purchases, construction or production of a qualifying asset are included as part of the cost relating to the asset. A qualifying asset is an asset for which considerable time is required to make it ready for its intended use or for sale.

Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are:

Buildings

30-50 years

Plant and machinery

10-15 years

Other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3-10 years

Spare parts included in plant and machinery are depreciated over 5 years.

13

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies (continued)
Gains or losses from the sale of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the selling price net of selling expenses and the carrying amount at the time of the sale. Gains or losses from current replacement of property, plant and equipment are recognised in other operating income and expenses in the income statement.
Impairment of fixed assets
The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation. If so, an impairment test is carried out to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount.
The asset is written down to its recoverable amount if this is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable amount of the asset is calculated as the higher of net selling price and value in use. Where a recoverable amount cannot be determined for the individual asset, the assets are assessed in the smallest group of assets for which a reliable recoverable amount can be determined based on a total assessment.
Impairment losses are reversed to the extent that changes have taken place in the assumptions or estimates leading to the write-down for impairment. Impairment losses are only reversed to the extent that the new carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount which the asset would have had, had it not been written down for impairment. Impairment on goodwill is not reversed.
Financial fixed assets
Other receivables
Receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets.
Investments in subsidiaries and associates
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are measured at cost in the Parent Company Financial Statements.
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost under the FIFO method and net realisable value. The net realisable value of inventories is calculated at the amount expected to be generated by sale in the process of normal operations with deduction of selling expenses and costs of completion. The net realisable value is determined allowing for marketability, obsolescence and development in expected sales sum.
The cost of goods for resale, raw materials and consumables equals landed cost.
14

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies (continued) The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises the cost of raw materials, consumables and direct labour as well as directly attributable labour and production costs. These costs also comprise maintenance and depreciation of the machinery, factory buildings and equipment used in the manufacturing process as well as costs of production management. Receivables Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable. Dividend Dividend is recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the Annual General Meeting. Dividend expected to be paid for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item. Corporation tax and deferred tax Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as tax calculated on the taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable income for prior years and for taxes paid on account. Deferred tax is measured according to the balance-sheet liability method in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities. However, deferred tax is not recognised in respect of temporary differences concerning goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and other items where temporary differences ­ apart from business acquisitions ­ have arisen at the time of acquisition without affecting the profit for the year or the taxable income. In cases where the computation of the tax base may be made according to alternative tax rules, deferred tax is measured on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carry-forwards, are recognised at the value at which they are expected to be utilised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set-off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates in the respective countries that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement unless the deferred tax relates to equity entries.
15

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies (continued) Staff obligations Wages and salaries, social security contributions, paid absence and sickness absence, bonuses and non-monetary contributions are recognised in the financial year in which the Group's employees have performed the related work. Expenses relating to the Group's long-term staff benefits are accrued so that they follow the performance of work by the employees concerned.
The Group's pension schemes comprise defined contribution plans.
Moreover, provisions are made for seniority based bonuses earned over the employment period.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when ­ as a result of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date ­ the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic benefits must be given up to settle the obligation.
Provisions are measured at Management's best estimate of the amount at which the liability is expected to be settled. At the measurement of provisions, discounting is made of the expenses necessary to settle the liability if this has a material effect on the measurement of the liability.
Financial liabilities Mortgage credit loans and loans from credit institutions are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction expenses incurred. Subsequently, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost corresponding to capitalised value by use of the effective rate of interest so that the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the loan period.
Other liabilities comprising trade payables and other liabilities are also measured at amortised cost.
Cash Flow Statement
The cash flow statement shows cash flows for the year broken down by operating, investing and financing activities, changes for the year in cash and cash equivalents as well as cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the year.
Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the net profit for the year adjusted for noncash operating items, changes in working capital, financial income/expenses and corporation tax paid.
Cash flows from investing activities Cash flows from investing activities comprise cash flows from acquisitions and disposals of intangible fixed assets, property, plant and equipment as well as financial fixed asset investments.
16

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies (continued) Cash flows from financing activities Cash flows from financing activities comprise cash flows from the raising and repayment of noncurrent liabilities as well as payments to and from shareholders. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise the item "Cash at bank and in hand" under current assets net of current credits with banks that constitute an integrated part of the Group's current cash management. The cash flow statement cannot be immediately derived from the information provided in these financial statements.
17

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
2 First time adoption of IFRS
This is the first annual report prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Group has been established in 2014. Therefore, the Group did not prepare consolidated financial statements in prior years.
As of 31 December 2013 there were no differences between Swiss GAAP and IFRS for stand-alone entity Jacob Holm & Sons AG.
3 Significant accounting estimates
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets within the next financial year are addressed below.
Deferred tax asset The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of CHF 6m primarily relating to a tax loss carry-forward in France. The French plant has improved the productmix and expects to improve effeciency by upgrading the productionlines. On basis of this the Group expects to be able to utilise the tax loss carry-forward within the next 5 - 10 years.
Business Combinations For acquisitions of entities, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree are recognised using the acquisition method. No active market exists for the majority of the acquired assets and liabilities, in particular in respect of acquired intangible assets. Accordingly, Management makes estimates of the fair value of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Depending on the nature of the item, the fair value of an item as determined in the purchase price allocation may be associated with uncertainty and possibly adjusted subsequently. The unallocated purchase price (positive amount) is recognised in the statement of financial position as goodwill, which is allocated to the Group's cash-generating units. Only the TWIG acquisition resulted in recognition of goodwill. The TWIG Group forms one operating segment, and hence, goodwill has not been allocated across cash generating units. Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test as of 31 December 2014 is, due to the fact that the acquisition took place in 2014 based on a re-assessment of the fair value of the TWIG Group determined by an independent third party as a basis for the purchase price. In Management's view, the assumptions applied reflect the market conditions existing as of 31 December 2014. Hence, there is, in Management's view, no significant uncertainty associated with valuation of goodwill as of 31 December 2014.

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
15 Intangible fixed assets (continued) The Group has performed impairment test of Goodwill per 31 December 2014. Goodwill was recognised in April 2014 as part of the acquisition of the TWIG Group. The Group has performed the impairment test on basis of overall valuation of the TWIG Group prepared by Credit Suisse. The Group has evaluated that assumptions have not changed and as such there are no need for impairment of Goodwill. Valuation of the Companies was prepared on basis of the business plan for 2014 - 2018 and evaluated by comparing valuation according to DCF model, comparable trading companies and comparable transactions. When calculating value according to DCF model, a WACC of 8.1 - 9.7 % and expected terminal growth of 0 - 0.5 % was evaluated as true and fair. At year-end Management has assessed that the key assumptions used to determinate fair value at the time of the aquisition still reflects the market conditions at year-end. As a consequense there is no impairment of goodwill at 31 December 2014.

The Group's tax loss is subject to varying conditions and is expected fully utilised for set-off against positive taxable income within a 5-10 year period.

One of the entities to which the tax loss carry-forward relates to, realised a tax loss for assessment year 2014.
Management has prepared detailed forecasts for the coming financial years for the entity in question and has reassessed the expected time frame for utilisation of the tax loss carry-forward.
It is Management's assessment that the taxable income will increase in the coming financial years due to increasing earnings.
Management has therefore chosen to recognise the full tax base of the tax loss carry-forwards based on the expectation that tax loss carry-forwards may be fully set off against future taxable income within the specified time frame.

23 Other staff obligations

The Group offers the employees to participate in pension schemes in the form of defined contribution plans.
The provision for other staff obligations primarily includes seniority based bonuses for employees calculated by an actuary taking into account the expected turnover among employees, wage increases etc. A discount factor of 1,80% has been used against 3,00% in 2013.

As the obligation is uncertain as regards the time of settlement, no breakdown of time of maturity can be made. The entire obligation has therefore been classified as a non-current liability.

30 Financial risks (continued)
Liquidity risk
The Group ensures sufficient cash resources by entering into framework agreements for current overdraft facilities. Existing agreements with agreed upon repayment terms cannot be terminated by the banks unless there is a breach of the covenants stated in the loan agreements.
The covenants comprise measurements on specific financial ratios, including solvency, EBITDA in relation to fixed charges (interest, instalments, income tax, dividend and capital expenditure) and the cover of revolving credit by working capital.
In the event of breach of a covenant the Group has the right to remedy without undue delay, respectively is the bank entitled to terminate part or all of the outstanding loan facilities, should the Group not be able to do so.
Some of the Group's credit facilities are variable due to the fact that some of the Group's credit lines are based on the amount of the Group's trade receivables and inventory.
The analysis of due dates is stated on the basis of category and class broken down on due date. The calculation of interest payments on floating-rate obligations is based on the interest rate on the balance sheet date.
The cash need is expected covered by the current liquidity surplus from operations as well as unutilised credits.

*Information on fair value hierarchy is not relevant as the debt is subject to variable interest and no transaction expenses have been paid.
Market risk
The Group's credits are floating-rate credits, which exposes the Group to fluctuations in interest rates. It is Group policy that all financing of working capital and investments in non-current assets take place at floating interest rate.
No derivative financial instruments are used to hedge interest rate risk.
Based on interest-bearing debt at the balance sheet date, an increase in the market rate by 1% would decrease the profit for the year before tax of CHF 1,510k (2013: CHF 0k).
The Group's currencies used for payment are mostly distributed between EUR and USD. No financial instruments are used to hedge positions in foreign currency.

As the individual group companies primarily operate in their individual functional currencies, the Group's profit is primarily sensitive to changes in exchange rates due to intercompany accounts and receivables/ payables denominated in other currencies than the functional currency.

37

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
30 Financial risks (continued)

A 10% increase in USD compared to the exchange rate at 31 December 2014 towards all other currencies will entail a negative change of profit for the year before tax of CHF 3,595k (2013: CHF 0k) and a similar effect on equity.
A 10% increase in SEK compared to the exchange rate at 31 December 2014 towards all other currencies will entail a negative change of profit for the year before tax of CHF 8,248k (2013: of CHF 0k) and a similar effect on equity.

Capital management
The objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to yield return on investment to the shareholders and to create and maintain an optimal capital structure in order to reduce the costs of capital and maintain a basis of continued growth in the Group.
The Group's capital management is also partly governed by loan agreements which include requirements to financial ratios. These financial ratios are affected by the size of the capital, that a reduction will reduce the ratios. Total capital makes up the equity shown in the consolidated balance sheet.

34 Business Combination (continued) Sontara Description of acquired activities As of 1 September 2014, the Sontara® business unit has been acquired from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and one or more of its Affiliates through an asset purchase and sale agreement. As part of the acquisition, Jacob Holm will operate Sontara® assets in Asturias, Spain, and Old Hickory, TN, United States, for which relevant authorizations and licenses have been received. Sontara® is a global nonwovens business that produces products used in a variety of medical and specialty wipes applications. The acquisition is in line with Jacob Holms strategy and will strengthen the Groups competitive position in the nonwovens industry. As of April 2015, Sontara® has been fully integrated into the Group. The purchase price of CHF 50 million was paid in cash and pertains mainly to net working capital (CHF 25 million), fixed assets (CHF 23 million) and intangible assets (CHF 5 million). In 2014, the acquired business contributed revenues of CHF 65 million.
TWIG Description of acquired activities As of 26 March 2014, the TWIG Group, including TWIG Trading (Switzerland) GmbH, TWIG Trading GmbH and TWIG SAS, has been acquired from PMM Holding (Luxembourg) AG through the acquisition of 100% of the shares in each company.

The acquisition enables the Group to expand the marketing of spunlace by-products to all its manufacturing facilities in Europe and the US to the EMEA and NAFTA regions. The purchase price of CHF 14.8 million was paid in cash and pertains mainly to goodwill (CHF 13.5 million). A goodwill was recognized to reflect the Group´s access to customer contracts to generate future earnings, the know-how around sorting, pricing and treatment of by-products, and the business processes associated with value-adding activities for upgrading the product sold. In 2014, the acquired TWIG Group contributed revenues of CHF 2.5 million.
Information on full-year net result effect from acquired activities Due to the acquisition of Sontara being an asset purchase, the company is unable of calculating the full-year net result.

r-

ily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review

12 Impairment test relating to investments in subsidiaries

At 31 December 2014, Management reviewed the carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries and performed impairment tests as required. The carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries is distributed as follows:

2014 CHF '000

2013 CHF '000

Jacob Holm & Sønner Holding A/S, Denmark

122'850

0

122'850

0

The recoverable amount is based on the value in use at 31 December 2014. The value in use is based on future expected cash flows on the basis of budgets and estimates approved by Management for the financial year 2015. The value is primarily sensitive to the assumptions made regarding contribution margin and discount rate used.

In the impairment test a discount rate of 8.1% and a growth rate in the terminal period of 1.6% have been used.

The impairment test proved that there is no need for impairment of investments in subsidiaries.
