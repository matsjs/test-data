Ålesund, 17 December 2009
T H O R S H C v d i underway to the Antarctic
Thorshøvdi left Ålesund port 16 December at 18:45. After a long stretch with rebuilding and mobilization Thorshøvdi finally sailed to commence fishing for Antarctic krill. After the refinancing mid 2009, the vessel was delivered on estimated time and budget. The finalization at the yard was performed at shipowners' satisfaction - and extensive tests performed before departure verified that all systems worked satisfactory. Krillsea Group is highly thankful to all supporters to the project. This has been a big challenge and we could not have reached our targets without the contribution from bondholders, Innovation Norway, investors, shipyard, suppliers and highly motivated and competent employees. Thorshøvdi will now sail to Skagen (Denmark) to take approx 1800 tons of fuel. ETA of Skaw is 18 December LMT 16:00. After fueling the vessel will sail to Montevideo (Uruguay) and ETA is 10 January. After final mobilization we will bring CCAMLR Inspectors, who are independent inspector to observe the fishing authorized by CCAMLR and supervisors onboard in Montevideo. The vessel will sail for the fishing grounds in the Antarctic around 13 January. We would also like to refer to our web site www.krillsea.no for regularly news and information updates.
