ISIN: NO 001 036280.9 -1 2 .5 per cent Interoil Exploration and Production ASA Senior Unsecured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2010

Oslo, 1 June 2010 PROPOSAL TO POSTPONE MATURITY - SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING

1. BACKGROUND

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed as Loan Trustee for the bond issue with ISIN N0001036280.9 (the "Loan") issued by Interoil Exploration and Production ASA (the "Borrower").

The information in this summons regarding the Borrower and market conditions are provided by the Borrower, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

All capitalized terms shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Loan Agreements or the summons to this Bondholders meeting, unless otherwise stated herein.

The Loan is a senior unsecured bond issue with an outstanding amount of NOK 100 000 000. The original Maturity Date is 29 March 2010, which was extended to 31 May 2010 by a Bondholders meeting held 6 April 2010.

By now it is now assumed that the Bondholders are familiar with the situation of the Borrower, and in particular the developments regarding the secured bond issue and the Loan since 2 May 2009.

Further reference, of particular relevance for this Bondholders meeting, is made to the attached IQ presentation dated 7 May 2010.

According to the Borrower they are not in a position to repay the Loan on the Maturity Date 31 May 2010, however the Borrower informs that it is close to being in a position to present a complete refinancing solution.

Further, the Borrower proposes to extend the exercise period of the Call Option which was resolved by the Bondholders Meeting on 6 April 2010. It is proposed to extend the exercise period of the Call Option from 31 May 2010 to 31 July 2010 (or such other new Maturity Date that from time to time is agreed upon).

The Borrower has approached the Loan Trustee to convene a Bondholders meeting to consider a

postponement of the Maturity Date of the Loan for another two months, in order for the Borrower to

prepare and present a solution for the Loan, and for the Bondholders to evaluate such a solution.The

For more information on the Proposal and the situation of the Borrower, Bondholders may contact Kristen Jakobsen (Mobile : +47 915 48 408 / kristen@trafalgar.no) acting as the financial advisor for the Borrower.

2. THE PROPOSAL:
The Borrower proposes the following changes to the terms of the Loan.
a) The Maturity Date shall be amended from 31 May 2010 until 31 July 2010.
b) The Borrower shall for the period lfom 29 March 2010 until the Maturity Date (31 July 2010, or such other maturity date that from time to time is agreed upon), have the option to call the Loan at any time at 100% o f par. Clause 10.2. of the Loan Agreement shall be amended to read:
"10.2 The Borrower may redeem parts o f the Loan or the entire Loan asfollows (Call Option):
(i) at any timefrom and including 29 March 2010 to, but not including, the Maturity Date at 100% o fpar plus accrued interests on the redeemed amount.
Should the Borrower exercise its Call Option, the Loan Trustee and the Bondholders must be informed o f this (the Bondholders in writing via VPS) no later than 20 - twenty - Banking Days before the date o fredemption.
Partial redemption o f the Loan shall be carried outpro rata between the Bondholders wherebyfirst each bond with aface value ofNOK 500 000 is split into 500 000 bonds with aface value o fN O K 1 before carrying out the pro rata redemption.
Bonds redeemed by the Borrower in accordance with this clause shall be discharged against the Remaining Loan.

The Loan shall continue to accrue interest at the rate agreed on (12.5% p.a. + 5% p.a.) in connection with the Bondholders Meeting held 28 January 2010, as set out in the Amendment Agreement dated 10 February 2010.
The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposal is acceptable. The Bondholders should particularly be aware that the request for a two months postponement of the Maturity Date does not imply that the Borrower expects to be in a position to repay the Loan on this date, but is to be regarded as a request for more time in order to find and present an alternative solution to the Loan. The Bondholders should be aware that the Borrower may still have liquidity problems even if the Bondholders accept the Proposal.

Comments:  Production decreased by 5% compared to Q4 2009 mainly due to unexpected high depletion in Peru

 Revenue decreased by 15% since Q4 2009 due to lower production and increased inventory in Colombia, which will contribute to increased sales in Q2

 EBITDA increased due to lower cost of goods sold, exploration and administration expenses in Q1

> "one off " exploration expenses of USD 1.9 million connected to provision of cash calls in Angola

 "Normalized" EBITDA of USD 16.1 million

 CAPEX of USD 4.6 million in Q1 is connected to drilling in Peru and upgrade of facilities and completion of 2009 drilling campaign in Colombia

REVENUES AND PRODUCTION
