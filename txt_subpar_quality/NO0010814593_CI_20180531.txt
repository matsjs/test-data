May 30, 2018

We refer to the Bond Terms for the above captioned Bonds made between Nordic Trustee AS as Bond Trustee on behalf of the Bondholders and the undersigned as Issuer. Pursuant to Clause 12.2 of the Bond Terms a Compliance Certificate shall be issued in connection with each delivery of Financial Statements to the Bond Trustee.
This letter constitutes the Compliance Certificate for the Quarter ending March 31, 2018.
Capitalised terms used herein will have the same meaning as in the Bond Terms.
With reference to Clause 12.2 {Requirements as to Financial Reports) we hereby certify that all information delivered under cover of this Compliance Certificate is true and accurate and there has been no material adverse change to the financial condition of the Issuer since the date of the last accounts or the last Compliance Certificate submitted to you.

Chembulk Holding LLC and its parent company Chembulk Tankers LLC were not legally formed and not in existence until January 5, 2018 which was after the beginning of the Quarter ending March 31, 2018. Therefore, we cannot supply Interim Accounts for these entities in conformity with US GAAP accounting for the full Quarter.

Financial information for Chembulk Capital LLC was also provided to prospective Bondholders prior to the issuance of the Bonds, and the attached pro forma financial statements therefore provides the most relevant basis for measurement against the figures presented to prospective Bondholders prior to issuance o f the Bonds. In the same way as for the figures presented prior to issuance of the Bonds, the attached pro forma Interim Accounts submitted for Chembulk Capital LLC have been adjusted to include the transactions related to the Bonds for the Quarter as if the Bonds were issued by Chembulk Capital LLC. Starting with the Quarter ending June 30, 2018, which is the first full Quarter of operations for the Issuer, we will provide actual Interim Accounts for the Issuer and its Parent in accordance with US GAAP.
The Financial Covenants set out in Clause 14.22 {Financial Covenants) are met, please see the calculations and figures in respect of the ratios attached hereto.
We confirm that, to the best of our knowledge, no Event o f Default has occurred or is likely to occur. Yours faithfully,

The registered office is Trust Company Complex Ajeltake Road Ajeltke Island, Majuro, Marshall Islands MH96960.

Chembulk Holding LLC and its Parent company Chembulk Tankers LLC were legally formed on January 5, 2018 which was after the beginning of the Quarter ending March 31, 2018. Therefore, we cannot supply Interim Accounts for these entities in conformity with US GAAP accounting for the full Quarter.

Financial information for Chembulk Capital LLC was also provided to prospective Bondholders prior to the issuance of the Bonds, and therefore, provides the most relevant basis for measurement against the figures presented to prospective Bondholders prior to issuance of the Bonds. The pro forma Interim Accounts submitted for Chembulk Capital LLC have been adjusted to include the transactions related to the Bonds for the Quarter as if the Bonds were issued by Chembulk Capital LLC and reasonably reflect what the operating results of Chembulk Holding LLC and Chembulk Tankers LLC would have been, had they been in existence during the full Quarter.

Senior Secured Bonds
On February 2, 2018, the Company issued $200 million in Senior Secured Callable Norwegian Bonds (the "Bonds") pursuant to the Bond Terms, dated January 31, 2018 between the Company and Nordic Trustee AS, as the Bond Trustee. The Bonds do not amortize and will be paid in full when they mature on February 2, 2023. The Bonds were issued at par and have a coupon rate of 8% that is paid semiannually.
The Bonds Terms contain certain financial covenants that the leverage ratio defined as the ratio of outstanding bond amount less consolidated cash balance must not exceed 75% and the Company's free liquidity shall always exceed $15 million. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants as of March 31, 2018.
Provided that the Company meets the minimum liquidity and loan-to-vessel-value requirements in connection with vessel purchases, the Company may issue up to $50 million of additional Bonds (Tap Issuance) at current market rates to purchase additional vessels.
Fleet Development
During the period of January 1, 2018 and March 31,2018 the company sold its two LPG vessels, the Gas Batam and the Gas Sulawesi. The Company had previously decided to exit the LPG trade and with the sale of the two vessels, the company's focus is solely on chemical tankers. Since the purchase option on a chartered in vessel, The Chembulk Kings Point, was not attractive due mainly to forex rates; the Company did not exercise its option to purchase this Capital Lease Asset and returned the vessel to the lessor during the Quarter.
Vessel Performance
The Company's vessel utilization rate was 97.5% during the Quarter. There were 2,538 available days of trading in the Quarter and the Company incurred 63 off hire days for drydocking and repair resulting in 2,475 voyage days.
Market Overview
Market fundamentals remained largely unchanged during the Quarter. We remain optimistic about the medium to long term outlook for the chemical tanker industry. Industry indications reinforce that world demand for seaborne trade of chemical products is expected to continue to grow at or above world GDP growth. Demand for chemical products is forecasted to remain particularly strong in Asia as China and other countries convert to more consumer driven economies. Since the location of new chemical processing facilities is close to the favorably priced feed stocks in the US Gulf of Mexico and the Middle East, and far from the demand centers, the ton mileage required for chemical product shipments is expected to exceed the growth in GDP.

As demand remains strong for chemical products, the supply of new chemical tankers is anticipated to decline in the years ahead. The orderbook for new vessels, which peaked in 2014, has been notably declined and fleet growth is forecasted to decline below 2% during the foreseeable future.

As demand for chemical products steadily grows over time and the supply growth of new chemical tankers remains at levels below the last few years, the utilization of the chemical tanker fleet is anticipated to meaningfully increase along with the corresponding vessel earnings.
