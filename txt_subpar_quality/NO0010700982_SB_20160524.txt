7.50% Oro Negro Drilling Pte. Ltd. Senior Secured Bond Issue 2014/2019

Oslo, 24 May 2016
Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - Proposal for Extension of Period for Initial Receivables Factoring
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (together, the "Bondholders") in the abovementioned bond issue (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue"), a bond loan of USD 939,100,570 issued by Oro Negro Drilling Pte. Ltd. (the "Issuer").
Capitalized terms used herein (and in Schedule B hereto) shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 29 April 2016, made between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee in respect of the Bond Issue (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein.
Any information in this notice regarding the Issuer and market conditions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.
1 BACKGROUND
The Issuer, together with Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro, S.A.P.l. de C.V. (the "Parent") and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"), have been pursuing the financing of the outstanding accounts receivable of the Company by Greensill Capital (UK) Limited ("Greensill") and other potential sources of financing. However, for the reasons described below, certain delays have arisen which have made it necessary for the Issuer to request, as set forth below in the Proposal (as defined below), the extension of imminent deadlines under the Bond Agreement to allow additional time to obtain such receivables financing.
The primary cause of delays in completing the factoring of receivables with Greensill has been delays in the implementation of administrative procedures by the Company's sole customer, PEMEX, for the assignment of such receivables in connection with the factoring, which procedures are required due to the prior assignment by the Company of its receivables under the Mexican Trust Agreement pursuant to the Bond Agreement. The Company believes the implementation of all required procedures will be completed in the coming weeks and that the factoring of its currently outstanding receivables will be completed during the month of June 2016.

NORDIC TRUSTEE
Subject to the financing thereof by Greensill, upon the implementation of the assignment procedures by PEMEX, the Company anticipates factoring USD 43.3 million of outstanding accounts receivable that are currently paid in US Dollars, which will yield an estimated USD 36.6 million net of VAT and factoring fees.
The Company is also seeking to factor USD 48.8 million of outstanding receivables (for estimated proceeds of USD 41.3 million net of VAT and factoring fees), subject to the reversal of an election that the Company made to have such receivables paid by PEMEX in Mexican pesos. At the time of such election, the Company sought to manage currency risk by having US Dollar denominated invoices converted to Mexican peso amounts by PEMEX immediately prior to each payment thereon. However, Greensill has informed the Company that it is only able to factor receivables that are payable in US Dollars at this time. The Company believes that it will successfully reverse this election with PEMEX and then cause these receivables to be factored immediately thereafter.
Upon the factoring of receivables described above, the Company anticipates realizing sufficient proceeds to complete the payment of the Initial Payment Redemption Amount and outstanding professional fees (including success fees of financial advisors totalling approximately USD 7.925 million) as contemplated by Clause 10.4.1 of the Bond Agreement. However, upon the completion of such payments, the Company anticipates that its working capital will be constrained and that an extension of the current liquidity access provisions will be needed while the Company arranges for the factoring of approximately USD 44.3 million of further PEMEX invoices for contracted work during the period up to 1 June 2016 for estimated proceeds of approximately USD 37.5 million net of VAT and factoring fees.
The Proposal is intended to provide an extension of both the short-term deadline of 30 May 2016 for completion of factoring and payment of the Initial Payment Redemption Amount pursuant to Clause 10.4 of the Bond Agreement and address the medium-term operational liquidity requirements up until the Interest Payment Date on 24 July 2016, after which, subject to the timely issuance of invoices by PEMEX and the Company's ability to factor such receivables, the Company anticipates having sufficient cash to meet its obligations under the Bond Agreement.
The Proposal also amends the provisions of the Bond Agreement to clarify that payment of professional fees and expenses is required from the first proceeds of receivables factoring. This change is intended to implement the intended order of payments and ensure that the existing overhang of outstanding professional fees is resolved as soon as possible.
This summons letter is issued in order to seek approval from the Bondholders of the Proposal.
2 THE PROPOSAL
The Issuer has approached the Bond Trustee to convene a meeting of Bondholders ("Bondholders' Meeting") in order to consider the following proposal (the "Proposal"): (i) to amend the Bond Agreement to extend, until 24 July 2016, the Interim Budget Period, so that the Issuer can continue to have access to restricted cash pursuant to Clause 13.7(d) and will not be required to maintain a minimum Liquidity of USD 4,000,000 (US Dollars four million) per Rig as set forth in Clause 13.7(a) of the Bond Agreement so long as it is in compliance with the provisions of Clause 13.7(d); provided, that the weekly cash budget attached as Schedule A hereto would apply to the budget compliance provisions under Clause 13.7(d), (ii) amend Clauses 10.4.1 and 13.4(b)(i)(d) of the Bond Agreement to clarify that payment of outstanding professional fees and expenses is to be made from the first proceeds of factoring and extend from 30 May 2016 to 1 July 2016 the deadline to complete the payment of the Initial Payment Redemption Amount and all professional fees, (iii) waive, until following the Interest Payment Date on

5 SUMMONS FOR BONDHOLDERS' MEETING

Bondholders are hereby summoned to a Bondholders' Meeting:

Time:

31 May 2016 at 13:00 hours (Oslo time)

Place:

The premises of Nordic Trustee ASA, Haakon VIIs gt 1, 0161 Oslo - 6thfloor

Agenda: 1. Approval of the summons.

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon VIIs gate 1, Oslo

nordictrustee.com

2. Approval of the agenda. 3. Election of two persons to co-sign the minutes together with the chairman. 4. Request for adoption of the Proposal:
It is proposed that the Bondholders' Meeting resolves the following:
"The Bondholder's Meeting approves the Proposal as described in section 2 o f the summons for the Bondholders' Meeting and directs the Bond Trustee to prepare and make available to the Issuer and the Bondholders (by electronic mail i f requested) a conformed copy o f the Bond Agreement incorporating the amendments and waivers made to the same by the Proposal, as soon as practicable. The Bond Trustee is hereby authorised to execute and deliver an amendment and waiver agreement adopting the proposed amendments and waivers set out in section 2 (The Proposal) o f the summons for the Bondholder's Meeting and any other documents deemed required by the Bond Trustee due to such amendments and waivers to the Bond Agreement. "
To approve the above resolution, Bondholders representing more than 2/3 of the Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the Bondholders' Meeting must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to have a quorum, at least 1/2 of the Voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting.
Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' Meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.)
The individual Bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising the Bond Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post to post@trustee.no, +47 22 87 94 10, or Nordic Trustee ASA, PO Box 1470 Vika, 0116 Oslo, Norway).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' Meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' Meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond Trustee, to notify the Bond Trustee by telephone or by e-mail (as set out on the first page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4:00 pm) (Oslo time) the Business Day before the meeting takes place.
Yours sincerely Nordic Trustee ASA
