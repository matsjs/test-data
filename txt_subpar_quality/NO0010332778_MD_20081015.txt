Re. FRN Forstædernes Bank A/S Open Bond Issue 2006/2011
Dear Sirs
We refer to the abovementioned Bond Issue dated 30. March, 2006 and made between us (the "Bank"), Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (Loan Trustee) on behalf of the Bondholders as Agent / Arranger for the Bondholders therein (the "Agent") and the Bondholders set out therein (the "Bondholders") (the `Facility Agreement"). We would be grateful if you would provide a copy of this letter and attached documents to the Bondholders.
As you are aware the Bank has been made the subject of a public offer for all its shares (the "Takeover Offer") by Nykredit Realkredit A/S (the "Offeror").
For your information the Offeror has today announced that it has received sufficient accep tances of the Takeover Offer and that it has made the Takeover Offer unconditional. As an nounced by the Offeror, settlement of the share transfer will take place on 23 October 2008.
A copy of an English translation of the announcement made to Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen A/S this morning is attached to this letter.
We view the takeover as a positive event as the Bank will have an even stronger base to work from and we look forward to continue our cooperation.
With this week's announcements of European bank-guarantee schemes we have considered it appropriate to postpone the announced investor-presentation on 20 October 2008 in Co penhagen and replace with a dial-in conference call on 27 October 2008 at 10:00 AM, which can be held in a more time-efficient manner and still ensure that Lenders are well-informed about the change of control. An invitation for the dial-in conference call will follow separately.
