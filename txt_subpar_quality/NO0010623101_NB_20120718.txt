To the Bondholders in: ISIN: NO 001 062310.1 - 13.75 per cent TrollDrilling & Services Ltd.
Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2011/2016
Oslo, 18 July 2012
Notice From Bondholders' Meeting
On 17 July 2012 a Bondholders' meeting was held pursuant to summons of 2 July 2012 (the "Summons"). All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement or the Summons unless otherwise stated. The original proposed Proposal (as set out in the Summons) was subject to firm contract for Troll Solution, evidenced either as a signed document from BP where the deadline for acceptance is amended (or an updated contract document), or a signed contract with Perenco if/when BP's sale of Southern Gas assets is concluded. At this stage Troll will not be able to provide such documentation. Therefore, there has been a dialog between Bondholders and Troll and its advisors to amend the Proposal.
The Amended Proposal Troll and its advisors have contacted a majority of more than 2/3 of the Bondholders to have their acceptance to amend the Proposal as follows (together with the original Proposal, the "Amended Proposal"):
(i) Amendment to Clause 3.1.15 - Disbursement of funds Clause 3.1.15 in Summons shall be amended to: 1. Application o ffunds from the USD 20,000,000 Bond Amount Increase is subject to revised security documents accepted by the Trustee. 2. The full Interest payment amount due on 19 August 2012 to be withheld on an escrow account untilpayment is due. Clause 3.1.15 - 1 - (i) as described in the Summons is to be deleted.
(ii) Equity ratio (Clause 3.1.3) For the avoidance of doubt, the minimum Equity Ratio as referred to in Clause 3.1.4 in the Summon shall be reduced from 30% to 25% from and including 30 June 2012 to but not including 29 September 2013.

If an amount of USD 6,600,000 is transferred from Spring Capital to the Escrow Account within 15 September 2012, the Bergen Group Share Pledge shall be deleted.

The Voting There were sufficient Bondholders present at the meeting to form a quorum. The proposed resolution obtained 94.23 % of the votes, and the proposal was adopted according to the voting requirements of the Bond Agreement. Bond Agreement Remains Unchanged After the Bondholders' meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company has considered the Amended Proposal, and has decided that they will not accept the Amended Proposal. The Bond Agreement will therefore remain unchanged. Yours sincerely Ola Nygård
