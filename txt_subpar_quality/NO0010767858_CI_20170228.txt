CEO Statement
Paul W ogan, C hief Executive Officer, stated: "GasLog had a strong final quarter o f the year and despite the market volatility in 2016, continued to execute on its strategy throughout the year.
We signed a seven-year charter with Centrica, a leading European energy company and a new customer for GasLog. We made encouraging progress on our FSRU strategy both through signing a SPA to acquire a 20% interest in Gastrade, a company that is developing a FSRU project in Northern Greece, and securing long-lead items for a FSRU vessel conversion. We took delivery o f the GasLog Gibraltar on time and on budget and it immediately commenced a seven-year charter to Shell. Finally, we announced and completed the dropdown o f the GasLog Seattle to GasLog Partners, demonstrating the effectiveness of our master lim ited partnership ("MLP") as a cost-efficient funding vehicle for GasLog.
L ooking forward, we expect to drop down another vessel into GasLog Partners in the first h a lf o f 2017, providing GasLog with additional capital. This, along with all the achievements o f 2016, places the Company in a strong position to take advantage o f opportunities we expect to arise as the LNG shipping market supply and demand balance continues to tighten. We remain confident that 2017 will be a productive year for GasLog and its shareholders."
Charter Party Agreement with Centrica and Newbuilding Order
In October 2016, GasLog entered into a time charter party agreement with a subsidiary o f Centrica for a period o f seven years, commencing in 2019. In conjunction with this new charter award, GAS-twenty eight Ltd. entered into a shipbuilding contract with Samsung for the construction o f one LNG carrier (180,000 cbm). The vessel is expected to be delivered in the second quarter o f 2019.

Delivery o f the GasLog Gibraltar

On October 3 1 ,2 0 1 6 , GasLog took delivery o f the GasLog Gibraltar, a LNG carrier o f 174,000 cbm with tri-fuel diesel electric ("TFDE" ) propulsion constructed by Samsung. The vessel is chartered out to M ethane Services Lim ited ("MSL" ), a subsidiary o f Shell, from delivery until 2023.

Agreement for a FSRU Project with Gastrade

In December 2016, GasLog entered into a SPA to acquire a twenty percent (20%) shareholding in Gastrade, a private limited company licensed to develop an independent natural gas system offshore Alexandroupolis in Northern Greece utilizing a FSRU along with other fixed infrastructure. GasLog, as well as being a shareholder, will provide operations and m aintenance ("O&M" ) services for the FSRU through an O&M agreement. Gastrade is currently in discussions with a num ber o f additional potential investors, including DEPA, the Greek state owned gas com pany, Bulgarian Energy Holding ("BEH" ), the holding company o f the Bulgarian M inistry o f Energy and m ajor gas suppliers and targets to take final investm ent decision ("FID" ) by the end o f 2017 with the FSRU scheduled to be operational by the end o f 2019. The acquisition closed on February 9, 2017.

Order o f FSRU LLIs for LNG Carrier Conversion

Keppel, the w orld's leading shipyard for FSRU conversions, has begun ordering LLIs required for the FSRU conversion o f a GasLog or GasLog Partners LNG carrier. The LLIs will take approxim ately 12 m onths to deliver at a total cost o f around $16 m illion. Ordering the LLIs reduces the time necessary to convert an LNG carrier from between 18-20 months to 6-8 months once the LLIs are delivered.

Dropdown o f the GasLog Seattle

On November 1,2016, GasLog Partners acquired from GasLog 100% o f the ownership interest in GAS-seven Ltd., the entity that owns the GasLog Seattle, for an aggregate purchase price o f $189.0 m illion, including $1.0 m illion o f positive net working capital. The acquisition was partially financed with proceeds from the public offering completed by GasLog Partners in August 2016.

GasLog Partners Equity Offering

On January 27, 2017, GasLog Partners completed an equity offering o f 3,750,000 common units at a price to the public o f $20.50 per common unit. The Partnership plans to use the net proceeds from the public offering for general partnership purposes, which may include future acquisitions, debt repayment, capital expenditures and additions to working capital. We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be $75.5 m illion (excluding $1.6 m illion from the sale o f general partner units to GasLog to maintain its 2.0% interest in the Partnership).

Chief Financial Officer Transition

In January 2017, Simon Crowe, GasLog and GasLog Partners' C h ief Financial Officer ("CFO" ) informed the board o f directors o f his intention to step down from the position o f CFO in March 2017. As GasLog's CFO for four years and GasLog Partners' CFO since its inception, Mr. Crowe has been instrum ental in supporting the C om pany's growth, with a focus on the balance sheet and capital structure. His num erous successful financing activities have put GasLog and GasLog Partners in a strong financial position.

On February 1,2017, GasLog and GasLog Partners announced that the board o f directors had appointed Alastair Maxwell as CFO with an expected effective date in early March 2017.

Dividend Declaration

On November 17, 2016, the board o f directors declared a dividend on the Series A Preference Shares o f $0.546875 per share, or $2.5 m illion in the aggregate, payable on January 3, 2017 to holders o f record as o f December 30, 2016. GasLog paid the declared dividend to the transfer agent on December 30, 2016.

On February 16, 2017, the board o f directors declared a quarterly cash dividend o f $0.14 per common share payable on March 16, 2017 to shareholders of record as o f March 6, 2017.

There were 2,078 and 7,439 operating days for the quarter and the year ended December 3 1 ,2 0 1 6 , respectively, as compared to 1,701 and 6,097 operating days for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2015, respectively. The increase in operating days resulted mainly from the acquisitions o f the Methane Becki Anne and the M ethane Julia Louise on March 31,2015 and the deliveries o f the GasLog Salem, the GasLog Greece, the GasLog Glasgow, the GasLog Geneva and the GasLog Gibraltar on April 30, 2015, March 29, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and October 31,2016, respectively, combined with fewer off-hire days due to scheduled drydockings.
Profit was $46.4 m illion and $28.1 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31 ,2 0 1 6 , respectively ($18.2 m illion and $53.7 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2 0 1 5 , respectively). The increase in profit for the quarter is mainly attributable to the increased profit from operations mainly due to the higher num ber o f operating days, as well as increased unrealized gain from swaps' mark to market valuations in the fourth quarter o f 2016. The decrease in profit for the year is mainly attributable to the increased financial costs derived mainly from the write-off o f unamortized fees associated with the six legacy facilities that were refinanced by the credit agreement entered into in July 2016 (the "Legacy Facility Refinancing") and the recycling o f accumulated loss from equity to the statement o f profit or loss related to the swap agreements that were terminated in July 2016, partially offset by a net increase in profit from operations resulting mainly from the increase in operating days m itigated by a lower daily hire rate affected by the vessels operating in the spot market.
Adjusted Profit(1) was $18.9 m illion and $57.5 m illion for the quarter and the year ended Decem ber 3 1 ,2 0 1 6 , respectively ($14.0 m illion and $55.9 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2015, respectively), adjusted for the effects o f the non-cash gain/(loss) on swaps, the write-off o f unamortized loan fees, as well as the net foreign exchange losses.
Profit/(loss) attributable to the owners o f GasLog was a profit o f $31.3 million and a loss o f $21.5 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively (profit o f $5.5 m illion and $10.8 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2015, respectively). The increase in profit attributable to the owners o f GasLog for the quarter and the decrease for the year resulted mainly from the respective movements in profit m entioned above.
EBITDA(1) was $84.8 m illion and $301.0 m illion for the quarter and the year ended Decem ber 3 1 ,2 0 1 6 , respectively ($68.0 m illion and $262.2 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2015, respectively).
Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $85.4 m illion and $302.4 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 3 1 ,2 0 1 6 , respectively ($69.2 m illion and $263.0 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2015, respectively).
EPS was earnings o f $0.36 and a loss o f $0.39 for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2016, respectively (earnings o f $0.04 for both the quarter and the year ended December 31,2015). The increase in earnings per share for the quarter and decrease in earnings per share for the year are mainly attributable to the respective movements in profit attributable to the owners o f GasLog discussed above.
Adjusted EPS(1) was earnings o f $0.02 and a loss o f $0.03 for the quarter and the year ended December 3 1 ,2 0 1 6 , respectively (a loss o f $0.02 and earnings o f $0.07 for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2015, respectively).
Revenues were $126.5 m illion and $466.1 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2016, respectively ($107.5 m illion and $415.1 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2015, respectively). The increase in revenues was mainly driven by the new vessel deliveries and on-the-water vessel acquisitions during the previous periods and fewer off-hire days due to scheduled drydockings.
Vessel operating and supervision costs were $29.4 m illion and $112.6 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2016, respectively ($24.6 m illion and $98.6 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2015, respectively).
Voyage expenses and comm issions were $2.5 m illion and $15.2 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 3 1 ,2 0 1 6 , respectively ($4.1 m illion and $14.3 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31 ,2 0 1 5 , respectively).
Depreciation was $33.9 m illion and $123.0 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31 ,2 0 1 6 , respectively ($28.5 m illion and $106.6 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2015, respectively).
The increases in vessel operating and supervision costs and depreciation were mainly attributable to the increase in ownership days from our increased fleet as discussed above.
General and administrative expenses were $10.3 m illion and $38.6 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31 ,2 0 1 6 , respectively ($10.9 million and $41.3 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2015, respectively). The year-on-year decrease is mainly attributable to a decrease in legal and professional expenses partially offset by an increase in all other expenses.
Financial costs were $30.6 m illion and $137.3 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31 ,2 0 1 6 , respectively ($24.7 m illion and $92.0 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2015, respectively). An analysis o f financial costs is set forth below:

For the year ended December 31,2016, an amount o f $18.2 m illion o f unamortized loan fees associated with the six legacy facilities that were refinanced by the Legacy Facility Refinancing is included in Amortization and write-off o f deferred loan and bond issuance costs and premium.

Gain on swaps was $26.0 m illion for the quarter ended December 3 1 ,2 0 1 6 and loss on swaps was $13.4 m illion for the year ended December 3 1 ,2 0 1 6 (a gain o f $3.2 m illion and a loss o f $10.3 m illion for the quarter and the year ended December 31,2015, respectively). An analysis o f gain/(loss) on swaps is set forth below. The increase in gain on swaps in the fourth quarter o f 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter o f 2015 is mainly attributable to an increase o f $22.4 m illion in gain from mark-to-market valuation o f our interest rate swaps carried at fair value through profit or loss. The $28.2 m illion gain from mark-tomarket valuation o f our interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter o f 2016 derived from the fact that the L ondon Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR" ) yield curve, which was used to estimate the present value o f the estimated future cash flows, was higher than the agreed fixed interest rates resulting in a decrease in derivative liabilities from interest rate swaps held for trading as compared to September 30, 2016.

(5) Pursuant to the agreement signed, with MSL on April 21, 2015, with respect to the GasLog Sydney, whose charter was shortened, by eight months under such agreement, if MSL does not exercise the charter extension options for the GasLog Sydney, and. GasLog Partners does not enter into a third-party charter for the GasLog Sydney, GasLog and. GasLog Partners intend, to enter into a bareboat or time charter arrangement that is designed, to guarantee the total cash distribution from the vessel for any period, of charter shortening.
(6) On February 24, 2016, GasLog's subsidiary, GAS-twenty six Ltd., completed, the sale and. leaseback of the Methane Julia. Louise with Lepta Shipping Co. Ltd.. ("Lepta Shipping") has the right to on-sell and. lease back the vessel. The vessel was sold, to Lepta Shipping for a total consideration approximately equivalent to its current book value. GasLog has leased, back the vessel under a bareboat charter from Lepta Shipping for a period, of up to 20 years. GasLog has the option to re-purchase the vessel on pre-agreed. terms no earlier than the end. of year ten and. no later than the end. of year 17 of the bareboat charter. The vessel remains on its eleven-year- charter with MSL, a subsidiary of Shell.

Future Deliveries

GasLog has three new buildings on order at Samsung and two new buildings on order at Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. ("H yundai" ). Our vessels presently under construction are on schedule and within budget. The expected delivery dates are as follows:

Hulls Hull No. 2130 Hull No. 2800 Hull No. 2801 Hull No. 2131 Hull No. 2212

Delivery date Q1 2018 Q 1 2018 Q1 2018 Q 1 2019 Q2 2019

Shipyard Samsung Hyundai Hyundai Samsung Samsung

Our subsidiaries that own two o f the vessels expected to be delivered in 2018 and one vessel expected to be delivered in 2019 have entered into 9.5 year time charters with MSL. Our subsidiary that owns the remaining vessel expected to be delivered in 2018 entered into a seven-year time charter with Total in July 2016. Finally, our subsidiary that owns the last vessel expected to be delivered in 2019 entered into a seven-year time charter with a subsidiary o f Centrica in October 2016.

LNG Market Update and Outlook

W ith a significant forecast increase in LNG supply and a growing num ber o f new dem and centers, G asLog's demand outlook for LNG carriers with long-term charters remains positive. We continue to see tenders for m ulti-year charters for vessels, which we expect will be used to transport volum es from new liquefaction facilities coming online over the coming years. We believe that these new LNG volumes will create demand for additional ships over and above those available in the market today.

In the fourth quarter, there were several announcements that highlighted continued growth o f LNG supply and shipping demand. BP committed to purchase 100% o f the LNG produced by ENI's Coral South Floating LNG ("FLNG" ) facility. The facility is expected to be installed offshore M ozam bique and to have a capacity o f approxim ately 3.3 m illion tonnes per annum ("m tpa"). This comm itm ent allowed ENI to authorize developm ent o f the project. BP also announced an investment o f approximately $ 1 billion to develop gas reserves offshore M auritania and Senegal and to create a new LNG hub in Africa. PETRONAS' 1.2 m tpa M alaysian FLNG facility was one o f eight LNG liquefaction projects that successfully came online in 2016 (others include Sabine Pass, Australia Pacific, Gladstone and Gorgon). Total announced a $207 m illion investm ent in T ellurian's Driftwood LNG project. Finally, the rising LNG supply in the quarter was slightly offset by a supply outage at C hevron's Gorgon facility where Train 1 was shut down for m aintenance.

During the quarter, there were also several announcements for new FSRUs. These projects continue the trend o f new and existing importing nations selecting FSRUs, which are typically quicker to market and more flexible than land-based terminals.

Global Energy Infrastructure Limited signed a 20-year FSRU charter for its LNG import project in Port Qasim, Pakistan. This will be the third FSRU in Port Qasim, demonstrating the growing demand in the region. The CI-GNL (Ivory Coast LNG) consortium led by Total was awarded the rights to build and operate a 3 m tpa FSRU in the Ivory Coast. The Brazilian gas-to-power Porto de Sergipe Project took FID. In connection with the FID, the project's sponsor entered into a 25-year FSRU charter agreement. Also in the quarter, Turkey chartered its first FSRU, the GDF Suez Neptune, from the French utility company Engie. There were seven new FSRU awards during the year, a significant increase on previous years, demonstrating the growing demand for offshore re-gasification infrastructure. This compares to around 20 existing FSRU projects in operation around the world today.

In the shorter-term shipping market in the fourth quarter, brokers reported that spot rates in the Atlantic Basin increased to approximately $45,000 per day, with one end-of-year fixture reported above $50,000. The catalyst was greater ton-m ile demand with many cargoes going from the U.S. to Asia through the Panama Canal. Spot charter terms have also improved with round trip econom ics now seen on some short term voyages. In the Pacific Basin, reported rates were lower at around $38,000 per day than the Atlantic, largely due to the greater availability o f vessels during the period.

During the quarter, U.S. natural gas prices increased 30% to $4 per m illion British thermal units ("m mbtu" ). However, Northeast Asian LNG prices rose by 60% to approximately $10 per mmbtu due to a cold start to winter in key demand centers such as Japan, China and Korea. Destination flexibility allowed offtakers to send more LNG cargos to Asia, which increased ton-mile demand. For 2016 in total, there were approximately 275 short term fixtures, an increase o f more than 50% over 2015. W hilst it is too early to predict a sustained recovery we believe that fundamentals continue to point to a recovery, through 2017 and beyond.

EXHIBIT II

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS

EBITDA is defined as earnings before depreciation, amortization, interest income and expense, gain/loss on swaps and taxes. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before foreign exchange gains/losses. Adjusted Profit represents earnings before write-off and accelerated amortization o f unamortized loan/bond fees and premium, foreign exchange gains/losses and non-cash gain/loss on swaps that includes (if any) (a) unrealized gain/loss on swaps held for trading, (b) recycled loss o f cash flow hedges reclassified to profit or loss in relation to derivatives no longer designated as hedges and (c) ineffective portion o f cash flow hedges. Adjusted EPS represents earnings attributable to owners o f the Group before non-cash gain/loss on swaps as defined above, foreign exchange gains/losses and write-off and accelerated amortization o f unamortized loan/bond fees and premium, divided by the weighted average num ber o f shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that are used as supplemental financial measures by management and external users o f financial statements, such as investors, to assess our financial and operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures assist our management and investors by increasing the comparability o f our performance from period to period. We believe that including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS assists our management and investors in (i) understanding and analyzing the results o f our operating and business performance, (ii) selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives and (iii) monitoring our ongoing financial and operational strength in assessing whether to continue to hold our common shares. This is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods of, in the case o f EBITDA and A djusted EBITDA, interest, gain/loss on swaps, taxes, depreciation and amortization, in the case o f Adjusted EBITDA, foreign exchange gains/losses, and in the case o f Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS, non-cash gain/loss on swaps, foreign exchange gains/losses and write-off and accelerated amortization o f unamortized loan/bond fees and premium, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect results o f operations between periods.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS have lim itations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives to, or as substitutes for, or superior to profit, profit from operations, earnings per share or any other measure o f financial performance presented in accordance with IFRS. Some o f these lim itations include the fact that they do not reflect (i) our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) changes in, or cash requirements for our working capital needs and (iii) the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt. Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adj usted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacem ents. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements o f cash flows and other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, lim iting their usefulness as a comparative measure.
In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some o f the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation o f Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the excluded items. Therefore, the non-GAAP financial measures as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures o f other companies in the shipping or other industries.
