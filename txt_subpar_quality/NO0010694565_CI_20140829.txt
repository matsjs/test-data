Financial risks The Group uses financial instruments to manage its foreign currency risk in charter hire. The Group has fixed rate on the long-term debt so there is no risk to interest rate. The Group has an active approach to currency risk and it is entered into agreements that reduce this risk. The Group's long-term debt is in US dollars. It is signed long-term time charters for four of its vessels with rate in US dollars. Payment to the company in that currency has a cash flow that covers the interest on its long-term loan in US dollars. Therefore there is no risk associated with the payment of interest on long-term debt.
Employees The Group had at June 30th 163 employees of which 160 sailors including hired personnel.
