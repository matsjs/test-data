Dear Sir/Madam,
Re: 9.25 per cent Mosvold Drilling Ltd. Senior Secured Bond Issue 2005/2010 with Call Option (the "Bonds")/ Informal Committee
As you are probably aware, the board of SeaDrill Limited has announced an intention to start discussions with the board of Mosvold Drilling Ltd. in respect of a cash offer to Mosvold's shareholders. Such offer, it was reported, has been made conditional on SeaDrill finding a financing solution with Mosvold's creditors, including holders of the Bonds ("Holders").
Yesterday, a first conference call took place amongst a number of Holders in which the fonnation of an informal committee of Holders (the "Committee") was discussed. Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, acting as trustee of the loan pursuant to which the Bonds were issued, attended that call as an observer.
It was decided on the call that it makes good sense for the Holders, as the principal creditors of Mosvold, to organize themselves in the Committee in order to facilitate any discussions with Mosvold and/or SeaDrill about a financing solution that would be in the best interest of the Holders.
In light of the above, we - on behalf of the Committee currently consisting of Holders representing approximately 25% of the Bonds - hereby invite you to join the Committee by contacting any of the following persons:
Peter J.M. Declercq (partner): Phone: +44 207 851 6065 (direct) / Mobile: +44 7919 556082 / Email: pdeclercq@brownrudnick.com
Mark A. Dorff (partner): Phone: +44 207 851 6005 (direct) / Mobile: +44 7979 966300 / Email: mdorff@brownrudnick.com
Jonathan Goldman (associate): Phone: +44 207 851 6190 (direct) / Mobile: +44 7760 252760 / Email: jgoldman@brownrudnick.com
hr addition, if you do choose to join the Committee, it would be extremely helpful if you would also share with us, on a confidential basis, the size of your holding, as this will assist us in assessing any decision making that is required under the loan agreement.
Thanks very much.
