CLARIFICATION OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT
Reference is made to the Loan Agreement of December 20, 2006. All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Loan Agreement. Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as Loan Trustee for the Loan. It has come to our attention that the wording in the Loan Agreement Clause 10.1 is unclear as to when the relevant due dates for installments to be made occur, in that it may appear to offer unintended flexibility to the Issuer. To avoid any future uncertainty, Norsk Tillitsmann ASA and Sevan Marine ASA have agreed to clarify clause 10.1 in the Loan Agreement by an Amendment Agreement. The word "within" will therefore be replaced by the word "on the date occuring". Accordingly, clause 10.1 now reads as follows:
" 10.1 The Bonds shall repaid as follows: (i) USD 5,000,000 on the date occuring 1 year after Acceptance Date, (i) additional USD 7,500,000 on the date occuring 2 years after Acceptance Date, (ii) additional USD 7,500,000 on the date occuring 3 years after Acceptance Date, (iii) additional USD 7,500,000 on the date occuring 4 years after Acceptance Date, (iv) remaining amount (expected to be USD 112,000,000) at Maturity Date."
This is for the Bondholders' information.
Best regards Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
