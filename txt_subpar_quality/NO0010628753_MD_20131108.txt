(collectively, the "Bond Issues")

Oslo, 8 November 2013

Re. Pro forma calculation fulfilled in bond agreements and one-time payments

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the above-mentioned Bond Issues, which are documented in bond agreements dated (i) 16 November 2011 in respect of the 2016 Bond Issue (the "2016 Bond Agreement") and (ii) 8 June 2012 in respect of the 2015 Bond Issue (the "2015 Bond Agreement") (each also referred to as a "Bond Agreement" and jointly as the "Bond Agreements"). Songa Offshore SE is the issuer of the Bonds (the "Issuer").

Capitalised terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings ascribed to such terms in the Bond Agreements, the summons dated 16 May 2013 (the "Initial Summons"), the summons dated 1 October 2013 (the "Second Summons") or any Finance Document, as the context requires.

The information in this summons regarding the legal, operational and financial status of the Issuer is provided by the Issuer. The Bond Trustee and its advisors expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever arising from such information provided by the Issuer.

The Bond Trustee has, based on the report from the advisor, Borgersen 8t Partners (the "Advisor"), determined that the Issuer's LTM Pro Forma Leverage Ratio reporting as of 31 October 2013 satisfies the requirement with a LTM Pro Forma Leverage Ratio above 4.0:1 and below 5.0:1.

In accordance with the Initial Summons, a one-time payment will therefore be distributed to the Bondholders as follows:

The 2015 Bond Issue: Payment: 0.73573% (flat) of principal amount Payment Date: 12 November 2013 Record Date: 8 November 2013

The 2016 Bond Issue: Payment: 1.28524% (flat) of principal amount Payment Date: 12 November 2013 Record Date: 8 November 2013

Yours sincerely
