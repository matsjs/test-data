BRADO AB (PUBL) / FRÖSUNDA OMSORG
Brado AB was established in October 2017 and is controlled by Kristian Adolfsen (50%) and Roger Adolfsen (50%). The company acquired 100 percent of the shares in Frösunda Holdco AB and its subsidiaries as per 6 March 2018. Frösunda Holdco AB and its subsidiaries are consolidated as from that date. Frösunda is a leading Swedish private provider of care services. Frösunda Group consists of a number of companies, where operations are conducted within the four segments; Personal Assistance, Disability, Individual & Family and Elderly Care. The below structure offers an overview of the Group and its segments but shall not be regarded as a complete legal structure.

Brief description of the four segments:
The Personal Assistance segment provides help in the daily life of its customers. Each customer is supported by an assistance team ensuring availability on short notice around the clock. The services are offered in the homes of the customers or wherever they are.
The Disability segment offers a range of services directed towards disabled people in order to support them in living independent lives. The segment employs experienced staff and has several units with the customized facilities to assist the customers. The services are offered at operational units or at Frösundas own full responsibility units.
The Elderly Care segment offers housing for elderly who are unable to live on their own. Staff and units can support different needs related to illness, dementia diagnosis or age weaknesses. Strong environmental focus to create relaxed surroundings is implemented in full responsibility units.
The Individual & Family segment offers a break or new start for children and youth with a troubled upbringing. The Group owns and operates several units, in addition to collaborating with several families to provide safe and stable surroundings.

GROUP ACTIVITIES
The first quarter of 2018 has been characterized by continued focus on quality in all our segments, in addition to efforts to adjust the staffing to the business case level, in order to achieve the desired run-rate of 4.7% (EBITA). During Q1'18, the Group has identified synergy potential within the Adolfsen Group, e.g. related to purchasing and IT-services.
In March 2018, Susanne Sidén decided to resign from the position as CEO at Frösunda. Kristoffer Lorck, a representative of the new owners, will assume the position as acting CEO from June 2018 and will remain in such interim position until a permanent solution is in place.
The Group established an RCF facility of SEK 80 million with Pareto Bank which replaced a facility previously held with Nordea.
FINANCIALS
As this is the first interim report presented by Brado AB after the acquisition on 6 March 2018, no directly comparable figures exist. Included in the report is pro-forma consolidated Group figures for Q1'18, as if the Group existed per 1 January 2018 (marked PF), compared with consolidated group figures for Frösunda Bidco AB for 2017 (the previous owner of Frösunda Holdco AB). In addition, the report includes consolidated Group figures for the period from the acquisition date until 31 March 2018. In 2017, the company presented its result before and after items affecting comparability (jämförelsestörande poster) with the purpose to visualize costs occurred outside of normal operations and to highlight the result in the underlying business. To get the best possible comparability, items affecting comparability have been reverted to the segment where they belonged in the PF figures for 2017. As from 2018, no items affecting comparability are reported.
Consolidated Income Statement during period 6 - 31 March 2018 (unaudited) The Group reported total operating revenue of SEK 200.9 million in the period 6 - 31 March 2018. PF Q1 2018 was SEK 604.1 million compared to PF Q1 2017 of SEK 724.4 million. The decrease in revenue mainly relates to the churn within Personal Assistance and the lower volume in migration services within the Individual & Family segment.
Total operating expenses in the period 6 - 31 March 2018 ended at SEK 212.8 million. Total operating expenses PF Q1 2018 ended at SEK 610.0 million compared to PF Q1 2017 of SEK 702.5 million. The decrease in PF expenses is explained by higher activity and more employees in 2017. However,the staff costs have not fallen at the same rate as the revenue. Staff costs as percent of revenue were 85.9% in Q1'18 compared to 84.3% in Q1'17.
EBITDA for the period 6 - 31 March 2018 ended at SEK -11.9 million. EBITDA for PF Q1 2018 ended at SEK -5.9 million compared to PF Q1 2017 of SEK 21.9 million. The decrease is due to:
· Transaction costs of SEK 13.8 million · Decreased intake of new customers (sales) in Personal Assistance due to business
development /quality focus · Reduced turnover within Individual & Family due to closure of several units in order to
change target groups, methods, etc . · Low growth within the Disability and Elderly Care segments in the latter part of 2017 and in
2018 (as previously compensated for reduced volume in PA) · Overhead cost is being reduced, however, not enough relative to the reduced volume

Brado AB / Frösunda Omsorg

Page 6

Actions going forward in order to reduce administration and to ensure growth in 2019: · Increased focus on taking in new customers in Personal Assistance · Preparing for full responsibility start up's in Individual & Family, Disability and Elderly care The units will be up and running during the second half of 2019 · Adjusting and streamlining central and regional overhead cost · Selected tenders will be placed primarily within Disability and Elderly care
Finance expenses in the period 6 - 31 March 2018 amounted to SEK -4.6 million. Finance expenses PF Q1 2018 amounted to SEK -9.4 million compared to PF Q1 2017 SEK -5.9 million. The increase refers to the refinancing in connection with Brado's acquisition of Frosunda Holdco AB.
Consolidated Balance Sheet per 31 March 2018 (unaudited)
Total assets ended at SEK 1 680.4 million per Q1 2018 compared to SEK 2 235.3 per PF FY 2017. The reduction mainly relates to goodwill adjustments in connection with Brado's acquisition of the shares in Frosunda Holdco AB. The purchase price allocation (PPA) supporting the acquisition, identification and valuation of intangible assets, calculation of goodwill and allocation of assets is still preliminary and will be concluded during the year. Total liabilities ended at SEK 1 492.9 million per Q1 2018 compared to SEK 843.9 million per PF FY 2017. The increase relates to refinancing in connection with Brado's acquisition of the shares in Frosunda Holdco AB with two new bond loans issued on 7 March 2018 in Brado AB. For further information see Note 7 - Bond loans.

Business Segments PERSONAL ASSISTANCE PF Revenue per quarter (SEKM)

PF EBITA per quarter (SEKM) 24

Revenues for the Personal Assistance segment ended at SEK 331.3 million in Q1'18 compared to SEK 359.3 million in Q4'17 and SEK 397.3 million in Q1'17. EBITA for Q1'18 ended at SEK 8.8 million (2.7%) compared to SEK 5.2 million (1.4%) in Q4'17 and SEK 36.7 million (3.2%) in Q1'17.
The number of customers at the end of Q1'18 was 987 (1 033 at Q4'17). 28 customers were moved from the Disability segment to the Personal Assistance segment in February.
During the past couple of years, the segment has focused on quality rather than sales, with the aim of retaining customers instead of replacing lost customers with new ones. We can now see that the service in three out of six regions achieves the stability and quality which makes it possible to turn the focus towards attracting new customers to enable organic growth from 2019.

PF EBITA per quarter (SEKM)

Revenues for the Disability segment ended at SEK 165.1 million in Q1'18 compared to SEK 170.0 million in Q4'17 and SEK 181.4 million in Q1'17. EBIT for Q1'18 ended at SEK 8.2 million (5.0%) compared to SEK 10.5 million (6.2%) in Q4'17 and SEK 9.6 million (5.3%) in Q1'17.
The number of customers at the end of Q1'18 was 917 (966 in Q4'17). 28 customers were moved from Disability segment to Personal Assistance segment in February.
A new management for the segment was established in the autumn of 2017. The business is now stable, both financially and in terms of quality. The decrease in revenue and EBITA compared to Q1'17 is mainly related to closed units (5) and costs to improve the quality in certain units. A major tender contract was won in 2017 with planned start June 2018. The start will be postponed due to a delay in the permission process (for more information, "outlook and main risk factors").

Q1'18

Revenues for the Individual & Family segment ended at SEK 34.8 million in Q1'18 compared to SEK 43.5 million in Q4'17 and SEK 70.6 million in Q1'17. EBITA for Q1'18 ended at SEK -2.3 million (6.6%) compared to SEK 0,2 million (0.0%) in Q4'17 and SEK 8.0 million (11.3%) in Q1'17.

The number of customers at the end of Q1'18 was 121 (175 in Q4'17).

As previously communicated, the revenues in the Individual & Family segment will decrease due to the transition from migration services to normal activities, which has been completed in 2017. This work has taken longer than expected, resulting in unstable quality of the underlying service in certain units. This has resulted in one withdrawn permission in February 2018 in addition to one unit being closed on own initiative in March 2018. Both units are expected to reopen during 2H 2018. Margins in the segment are expected to be lower than previous years, and the segment is in process of creating a stable platform for growth with improved margins. All units in the segment are expected to reach a satisfactory quality level during Q2 2018.

Q1'17 Q2'17 Q3'17 Q4'17 Q1'18
Revenues for the Elderly Care segment ended at SEK 72.8 million in Q1'18 compared to SEK 84.7 million in Q4'17 and SEK 75.1 million in Q1'17. EBITA for Q1'18 ended at SEK -10.7 million (-14.7%) compared to SEK -12.1 million (-14.2%) in Q4'17 and SEK -12.7 million (-16.9%) in Q1'17.
The number of customers at the end of Q1'18 was 458 (471 in Q4'17).
The reduction in revenues in Q1'18 compard to Q4'17 can primarily be explained by the closing of one unit in Sundbyberg. The segment shows improvements in quality parameters and can now shift focus to cost control. This applies primarily to adjusting staffing towards desired calculations.
The segment is expected to show solid growth in the years to come on the back of improved occupancy in existing units as well as growth from establishing new full responsibility units.

Outlook and main risk factors As described in the marketing material related to the bond issue in Brado AB, Frösunda had received a formal notice from Sundbyberg Stad with a claim of SEK 27 million in relation to damages caused by the alleged breaches of a contract for the provision of elderly care services. During Q1'18, Frösunda received a formal subpoena resulting in formal court proceedings. The company is still rejecting the claim and is of the opinion that it has a strong position in the legal proceedings.
In June, the Swedish Parliament will decide on the proposal to limit the possibility for private welfare companies to make profit. Based on the current political landscape, the proposal is unlikely to be approved. However, the issue remains in focus at least until the parliamentary election in September 2018.
IVO, "Inspektionen för vård och omsorg", is currently intensifying its work on quality review. This year, Individual & Family and Personal Assistance are in focus. The company appreciates the work of IVO and sees it as an opportunity to improve the business.
A change ot the permission requirments has been made by IVO, implying that all units in Elderly Care now needs permission. This has resulted in increased queues for obtaining new licenses. The risks of delaying new startups in all business areas can be expected.
By a strong opinion, the government has changed the directives in the LSS investigation and eliminated the requirement for savings. This will improve the market situation primarily in Personal Assistance. Although the effect is hard to quantify, this will result in a change of attitude of the authorities in regards to approving personal assistance. http://www.regeringen.se/pressmeddelanden/2018/04/besparingskrav-tas-bort-fran-lssutredningen/
Use of Alternative Performance Measures (APM) Alternative Performance Measures (APM) is understood as a financial measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework. Brado AB reports the financial measure "EBITDA", "EBITA" and "EBIT" in its quarterly reports, which are not financial measures as defined in IFRS. The reported numbers are included in the financial statements and can be directly reconciled with official IFRS line items. The APMs are used consistently over time and accompanied by comparatives for the corresponding previous periods.
