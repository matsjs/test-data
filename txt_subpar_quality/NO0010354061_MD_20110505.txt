CASE NO. 09-084819KON-NOHO: ABILITY DRILLING ASA, ITS BANKRUPTCY ESTATE - PRELIMINARY DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS TO BE HELD ON 2 MAY 2011

1.

Distribution of funds

The Estate refers to its letter to the District Court and to the creditors of 7 March 2011 with notice of assessment of claims, as well as a letter dated 31 March 2011 containing information regarding the preliminary distribution.

The reservations made in the letter dated 31 March 2011 regarding distribution of 31% dividend to the unsecured claims have now been lifted.

Nordhordland District Court, in its letter to the Estate dated 5 April 2011, agreed to such preliminary distribution which the board of trustees of the Estate have found basis for. Further, the Estate has received payment for sale of maintenance rigs.

The distribution of funds will take place on 2 May 2011.

2.

Estate funds - status

The bulk of the Estate's assets have now been realised. Of the settlement sum of MNOK 75 pursuant to the settlement agreement, TTS has undertaken a partial payment of MNOK 20. The Estate estimates that there should be a basis for distribution of a further MNOK 60 to the creditors of the Estate subsequent to receiving the funds into the Estate's account.
