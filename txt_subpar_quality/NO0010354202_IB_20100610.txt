To the bondholders in:
ISIN: NO 001 035418.6 (NOK) - FRN Primorsk International Shipping Limited Unsecured Open Callable Bond Issue 2007/2011
ISIN: NO 001 035420.2 (USD) - FRN Primorsk International Shipping Limited Unsecured Open Callable Bond Issue 2007/2011
Oslo, 10 June 2010
Information update - Primorsk International Shipping Limited
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as Bond Trustee for the above mentioned bond issue with ISIN N0001035418.6 (the "NOK Tranche") and ISIN N0001035420.2 (the "USD Tranche") where Primorsk International Shipping Limited is the Borrower (the "Borrower" or the "Company"). Jointly the two tranches are referred to as the "Loan". All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the agreement for the Loan (the "Loan Agreement").
As noted in the Company's 2009 audited financial accounts, the Company is in breach of the Book Equity Ratio covenant (the "Covenant Breach") per fiscal year end 2009. The Bond Trustee was informed about the Covenant Breach and the ongoing senior secured bank debt restructuring (the "Bank Restructuring") prior to receiving the audited financial accounts. Subsequently, on 31 May 2010, the Borrower entered into a Book Equity Ratio covenant waiver (the "Waiver") with certain bondholders representing approximately 46% of the Loan. The Waiver can be terminated on two business days notice and was among others put in place to facilitate continued progress in the Bank Restructuring. The Bond Trustee then entered into the same Waiver on behalf of the other Bondholders.
According to the Borrower, the ongoing Bank Restructuring, involving 13 syndicate banks and approximately USD 851 million of secured indebtedness (as of 31 December 2009), has taken more time than expected. However, the Company is hopeful that it will be completed within the next four to eight weeks. The Company has informed the Bond Trustee that it intends to summons to a bondholders' meeting, providing Bondholders with a complete financial and operational update, as soon as a consensus has been reached among the 13 syndicate banks. The Bank Restructuring will be contingent on an acceptable restructuring of the Loan.
The 2009 audited financial accounts will be made available to all Bondholders by contacting Nicolay Friis at ABG Sundal Collier Norge ASA (tel.: +47 2201 6145 or e-mail: nicolav.friis@abgsc.no').
Yours sincerely Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
