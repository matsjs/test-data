To the bondholders in the:
5.70% Global Connect A/S Senior Secured Bond Issue 2013/2018 with ISIN N00010678782 (the "Bond Issue")
Oslo, 8 July 2013 GlobalConnect A/S - Notice to the Bondholders regarding Interest Rate Swap Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is loan trustee (the "Bond Trustee") for the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue") where GlobalConnect A/S ("GlobalConnect" or the "Company") is the issuer. As described in the bond agreement dated 14 May 2013 (the "Bond Agreement"), the Company will apply the net proceeds towards refinancing of existing debt, financing further expansion of the Issuer and for general corporate purpose. Existing debt to be refinanced includes the Nordea Facility as defined in the bond agreement. As part of the Nordea Facility, the Company has entered into an interest rate swap maturing in 2019 with the purpose of swapping floating interest to fixed interest, with nominal value of DKK 230 million (the "Interest Rate Swap"). Due to interest rate fluctuations the value of the Interest Rate Swap has been negatively affected and consequently the Company will incur and realize a loss of approximately DKK 23 million if the interest rate swap is terminated today. The Issuer has entered into an agreement with Sydbank A/S whereby Sydbank A/S will assume the obligations under the Interest Swap Rate agreement from Nordea Bank Finland PLC. The Interest Rate Swap agreement will be included in the security arrangements covering the Working Capital Facility of DKK 120 million as defined in the Bond Agreement. To maintain the Interest Rate Swap as is will, in the opinion of the Company, be in the best interest of all the stakeholders of the Company including the holders of the Bond Issue. The Company has therefore approached the Bond Trustee to obtain a waiver to maintain the Interest Rate Swap with Sydbank A/S. If you as bondholder object to the Company maintaining such interest swap agreement, please make such objection to the Bond Trustee in written on post@trustee.no no later than 14:00 CET, 19 July 2013 (the "Objection Deadline"). If no objections are received within the Objection Deadline, the waiver will be granted and the Bond Agreement will be amended accordingly.
