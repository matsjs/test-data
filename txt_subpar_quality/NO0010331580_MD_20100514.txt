Voting on Proposed Plan of Reorganization

Background

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as loan trustee for the above mentioned bond loans with ISIN N0001033158.0 (Loan 1) and ISIN N0001042986.3 (Loan 2) where MPF Corp. Ltd is the borrower (the "Borrower"). Jointly the two loans are referred to as (the "Loans").

On 24 September 2008 the Borrower filed for insolvency proceedings under US chapter 11 and provisional liquidation in Bermuda. Since then extensive efforts have been made in order to sell the Borrowers assets. On 7 May 2010 the debtors filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the "Bankruptcy Court") a Joint Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan") and a Disclosure Statement for the Debtors' Proposed Joint Plan of Reorganization (the "Disclosure Statement") along with a motion seeking approval of certain procedures for solicitation of votes to accept or reject the Plan. The procedures for solicitation of votes were approved by the Bankruptcy Court on 12 May 2010. Subsequently NTM was asked to facilitate for the Bondholders in the Loans to cast their votes to accept or reject the Plan.

On this background we approach the Bondholders in order to give all Bondholders the opportunity to vote over the Plan. The voting is not a voting according to the respective loan agreements with respect to approving any amendments to these, but is strictly a voting for the purpose of the US chapter 11 Bankruptcy Court and its decision with respect to the Plan.

The Plan

As a short summary, the Plan contemplates the sale of substantially all of the Debtors assets to Cosco (Dalian) Shipyard Co. Ltd. for the purchase price of up to $105,000,000.00. DvB Bank is the holder of the senior priority claim against the Borrower. The Plan separates DvB's claims against the Borrower into three categories: (1) DvB DIP Loan Claims (approximately

$20,000,000); (2) DvB Secured Claim under the first lien credit facility with the Borrower (approximately $85,000,000); and (3) the remaining claims held by DvB as agent under the junior tranches of the first lien credit facility (approximately $151,000,000). The proceeds from the sale of the assets to Cosco will be used first to satisfy the DvB DIP Loan Claims and then to satisfy DvB's Secured Claims (for at total of approx $ 105,000,000). The remaining claims held by DvB as agent under the junior tranches of the first lien credit facility are considered under the Plan to be unsecured and will be treated for purposes of voting and distributions as General Unsecured Claims in Class 4 under the Plan. The Plan classifies both of the Loans as General Unsecured Claims.
The Plan creates a Litigation Trust of $50,000 for the purpose of pursuing causes of action on behalf of holders of General Unsecured Claims. The only recovery that General Unsecured Creditors will realize under the Plan is from the successful prosecution of such causes of action.
The Disclosure Statement with exhibits, including a copy of the Plan, is posted on www.stamdata.no under the title "MPF Corp. Ltd. - Joint Plan of Reorganization", together with this notice.
Any questions regarding the plan may be directed to counsel for the Debtors, Courtney S. Lauer, Vinson & Elkins L.L.P., at Telephone: +1.713.758.2912; E-mail: clauer@,velaw.com: or to counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, Ross Spence, Snow Fogel Spence LLP, at Telephone: +1.713.335.4832; E-mail: rossspence@,snowfogel.com.
