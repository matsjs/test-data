Dannemora Magnetit AB Super Senior Secured Bond Issue due 19 February 2014

Oslo, 24 January 2014
Notification of an Event of Default as a result of failure to satisfy a Milestone Condition
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned issue with ISIN NO001 070031.3 (the "Bonds") issued by Dannemora Magnetit AB (the "Company").
Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 7 January 2014 (the "Bond Agreement").
Clause 18.5 of the Bond Agreement provides that it will be an Event of Default if any Milestone Condition is not satisfied by its applicable date unless such failure is remedied within three Business Days from such applicable date. Sub-paragraph (a) of the definition of Milestone Event requires that NTM should have received, by 20 January 2014, evidence satisfactory to it that all rights and obligations under the Swedbank Lease Facility had been assumed by the Company.
Milestone Condition (a) was not satisfied by 20 January 2014 and the three Business Day cure period has now expired. Accordingly, there is an Event of Default outstanding under the Bond Agreement.
As a consequence of the occurrence of the Event of Default, NTM is entitled, in accordance with clause 7.2 of the Bond Agreement, to block further drawdowns by the Company from the Escrow Account (subject to the provisions of clause 7.2 relating to Override Drawdowns).
Notwithstanding NTM's entitlement to block further drawdowns from the Escrow Account, NTM will, in order to ensure the continued stability of the Company in the context of its proposed restructuring, seek immediate directions from the largest Bondholders to permit the next drawdown from the Escrow Account, which is scheduled to occur on 27 January 2014. NTM will post to the Bondholders a further notification regarding directions received in respect o f the next drawdown from the Escrow Account.
