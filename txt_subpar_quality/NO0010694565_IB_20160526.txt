World Wide Supply AS
The business
World Wide supply AS (the Company) was founded 19th of May 2010 with the objective to own and charter out vessels and invest in other similar companies.
The Company does not have its own office and staff in Norway, but have contracted out the management functions to other companies, except for an office in Holland where three people are employed to perform ship management activities. The management of the vessels are being performed by Remøy Management AS in Fosnavag and the Company's Dutch Employees.
The Company has not been able to resolve its debt position which continues to be challenging and may lead to the vessels being sold under the current market conditions, but the Company has received comfort from the bondholders that any new trade creditors will be paid in full from the Company's cash, even under enforcement of the securities, thereby enabling the Company to continue trading in a way where the contracting arrangements for the vessels are not disturbed.
Main events in 2015
The Company had at the start of the year 4 vessels on long term charters with Petrobras. All Petrobras Timecharters have a standard clause requiring a Certificate of Charter Authorization (CAA) to be renewed in order for the vessel to be allowed trading. What can stop the CAA from being renewed is if a Brazilian flag vessel declares a blocking of the contract. The purpose of this arrangement is to give a preferential treatment to Brazilian flag vessels. The vessel blocking the non-Brazilian vessel is supposed to take over the contract.
In June 2015 the Company's two vessels Peridot and Opal had their CAAs coming up for renewal. The vessels were blocked and the CAA not renewed. When this happens both the Company and Petrobras can terminate the contract. The vessel was put offhire by Petrobras and remained so until the Contracts were terminated by Petrobras on September 9th. The vessels then sailed back to Norway and were placed in lay up.
The Company has claimed chater hire from Petrobras for the offhire period, but such claim has been rejected by Petrobras. This claim was in the 3.quarter report accounted for as income and the claim placed as a short term receivable. Given that the claim was rejected by Petrobras and pursuing the claim would mean a lawsuit in Rio de Janeiro under Brazilian law, the Company's board and the auditor is of the opinion that this income must be reversed.

Based on the accounts for the 3 quarter a commission for charter income was paid to both Sydvestor AS and Remøy Management AS. Remøy agreed that since it is unlikely the Company will receive the money the commission was not warranted and repaid the commission. Sydvestor AS have refused relying on the board at the time recognizing the claim as current income likely to be received. The wrongly paid commission has been booked as a claim against Sydvestor AS in the Annual Accounts 2015.
Following the termination, the financial situation became untenable and months of negotiations between the Company and the Bondholders followed. In the end, 100% of the shareholders sold their shares to a newly established Company, WWS Recovery AS. On December the 28ththe board resigned and Mr. Aage Figenschou was elected sole Director.
The Company also terminated in December 2015 the corporate management agreement with Sydvestor AS, which expired on January 31. 2016.
The Market
The market has slowly deteriorated through all of 2015, and has continued to do so in 2016. The PSV segment is more overbuilt than AHTS, and at the moment more than 100 vessels are in layup in the North Sea and 500 globally. Some vessels are trading in the spot market, but unless one achieves continues employment one may lose more than placing the vessel in layup. However, having all vessels in layup makes it hard to compete for term business as charterers prefer "warm" ships.
Realistically we cannot expect a permanent improvement in the market before the oil price rise considerably, the oil companies increase their investment budgets and the surplus equipment is absorbed.
Second hand transactions are few and far between. Some sales have reflected a needy buyer, but if one tries to sell vessels to industry or financial buyers the prices will be far below broker values. Brokers values are given based on the assumption of a willing seller and a willing buyer and that nobody is in a hurry. If the question is how much a vessel will fetch if it must be sold within 3 months, the answer is completely different. Often 50% lower.
The Company is in breach of its financial agreements and the creditors can at any time enforce the securities. We must therefore assess a value of the vessels assuming liquidation and not value in long term use. This is the basis for the Company having booked an impairment reflecting a USD 10 mill value per vessel in spite of the average of broker values being the double.

Statement regarding the annual accounts. Annual result Total operating income in 2015 was NOK 217 914 447 and NOK 253 184 004 previous year. Operating expenses was NOK 232 813 888 and NOK 193 136 621 previous year. Earnings before interest and taxes was negative NOK 14 899 441 against positive NOK 60 047 382 previous year. Net financial expense was NOK 249 999 094 against NOK 193 669 896 previous year. Result of the year was negative 1 152 132 588 against NOK 132 998 385 previous year. The yearend disposition is presented in the income statement. Booked equity was negative NOK 881 761 677 against positive NOK 333 913 658 previous year. See below regarding going concern. Short term debt was NOK 1 350 937 914 whereof bond debt of 1 300 294 505. Total assets were NOK 549 405 458 against NOK 1 455 072 895 the year before. The Company does not perform own research or development after the accounting definition.
Risk Market risk The Company have two vessels on Time Charter with Petrobras. The CAA will be up for renewal on June 21 and August 10th respectively. There is a risk the CAA will not be renewed. Se subsequent events. The 4 other vessels are in lay up. There is therefore limited market risk. Should the Company decide to break lay up with one or more to trade in the spot market the most tangible risk will be not to obtain continued employment but pay full operating costs while earning no income. Should the Company succeed in obtaining term employment of some period it will reduce the market risk in the spot market.
Financial risk The major financial risk is that the Company is in breach of its loan agreements, an event of default has been declared and that the creditors have reserved their rights to enforce the securities at any time. Otherwise there is financial risk involved in that the Company has income and expenses in several currencies. Most of the risk in Brazilian Real is hedged by the Company receiving a part of the time charter hire in Real corresponding to a large degree to the expenses in Real. In Holland we have a staff of three being paid in Euro, in Norway Rempy Management AS have management contracts paying them in NOK. The Company is at the moment without income in Euro and NOK. The Company is at present not involved in financial hedging in the forward market.

Credit risk
The Company has a credit risk on Petrobras being our time charterer. There is little reason to believe Petrobras will default. Otherwise we have credit risk on the banks we hold deposits with. That risk is uncovered as well.
If we should start trading the vessels in the market we may assume counterparty risk, which must be assessed against the alternative. Interest risk The Company's bond loan has a fixed interest until May 2017. It should be noted the Company is at present not paying any interest.
Liquidity risk
The board and management have a particular focus on liquidity risk given the Company's current financial situation. Based on our best assessment the Company has adequate liquidity reserves to operate through the year 2016 as long as we do not pay interest or instalments. We are also focused on not go below the level of liquidity that allows us to pay all incurred but unpaid operating costs. Going concern
Given the fact that an event of default has been declared by the bondholders the accounts cannot be presented on the basis of going concern. The bond debt has therefore been booked as short term debt.
As a consequence of the above the fleet has been written down to a value of $ 10 million per vessel reflecting the liquidation value instead of the obtained brokers values which were ranging from $16 to $24 million.
The board of directors confirms the booked equity is lost.
The Company has not been able to resolve its debt position which continues to be challenging and may lead to the vessels being sold under the current market conditions, but the Company has received comfort from the bondholders that any new trade creditors will be paid in full from the Company's cash, even under enforcement of the securities, thereby enabling the Company to continue trading in a way where the contracting arrangements for the vessels are not disturbed.
Based on this the board finds that continued operation is warranted.
Working environment, Human resources, equal opportunity and discrimination. The Company had at year end 20 employees, thereof 1 woman.
Sick leave for the Company was in 2015 3,4% compared with 7,8% the year before. In 2015 the Company had one injury resulted in lost time, but no serious accidents. The accidents is investigated and measures are taken to avoid similar casas in the future.

The Board and CEO consider the working environment of the company as satisfactory. In our opinion the gender issues is satisfactory. It is not implemented or planned initiatives in this area. We believe that it is not done differences of employees, or employment based on ethnicity, national origin, race, color, language, religion or belief.
External environment.
The company operates supply vessels for the oil industry and represents as such a potential danger to the environment. The Company takes all steps to ensure a safe and clean operation.
Market outlook
The Company is facing a long period of depressed market rates. On a global basis 500 PSVs are in lay up and 100 PSVs are in lay up in the North Sea. Investment budgets for the oil companies are still being reduced contracting the demand for oil service assets. The board does not expect any consistent market improvement for several years.
Subsequent events
On January 31 2016 the management agreement with Sydvestor AS terminated. Remøy Management AS has assumed most of the functions performed by Sydvestor AS.
It has surfaced as a problem that the Company does not have its own staff, office and control of files and correspondence. Sydvestor AS has refused to hand over all electronic correspondence on behalf of World Wide Supply, but have volunteered to answer specific questions, if we have any. All correspondence about matters related to the Company rests on servers belonging to 3 party companies of which we have no control. This represents a problem and a risk in assessing what has actually transpired prior to December 28. 2015.
In 2016 the Company has also received notice that the two contracts for Emerald and Sapphire have been circulated in Brazil and that one vessel is blocked by 8 Brazilian flag vessels and the other by 9. We will try to work with Petrobras and give inducements for Petrobras to employ the vessels blocking us elsewhere. Our vessels are performing very well and Petrobras is satisfied with them. Petrobras have applied to the local authorities to keep the vessels for an additional 60 days in spite of being blocked. There is room for this under the local legislation. The outcome of the application is unknown. The most realistic outcome is however to expect the charters to be terminated in 2016.

NOTE 16 - FINANSIEL RISK
The company does not use financial instruments to manage its foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk The company has fixed rate so there is no risk related to interest rates.
Currency risk Fluctuations in exchange involves both direct and indirect risks for the company. The company has an active approach to currency risk and it is entered into agreements that reduce this risk. The company's long term debt is in US dollars. It is signed long term contracts for two of its vessels with rate in US dollars. The already signed contracts give the company a cash flow in this currency that covers the interest on its loans in US dollars. There is therefore no currency risk associated with the payment of interest on long term debt.
NOTE 17 UNCERTAINTY ABOUT GOING CONCERN
