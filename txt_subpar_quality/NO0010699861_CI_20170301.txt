The North Alliance AS - Interim report

Introduction
The North Alliance AS (NOA) is a group of companies offering services within communication, design and technology. The family of companies operates in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, USA and Singapore.

The group includes the following companies:

- Making Waves (NO, SE, PL, US) - Akestam Holst (SE) - Bold (SE, DK, NO) - StudioNoc (SE) - Promenad (SE) - Great Works (SE, DK) - AndCo (DK) - Anorak (NO) - Acoustic (SG)

Design & Technology Advertising Design Brand Experience Action Marketing and CRM Digital strategy and innovation Advertising Advertising Communication

In January 2016 NOA acquired the Swedish/American technology and design company Nansen, with over 100 employees in Stockholm, Chicago and New York. In Q3 an operational merger was completed with Making Waves.
NOA has closed down operations of StudioNoc in Q4 2016. Main reasons are low performance and limited synergies with other companies in the NOA group.
Financials
Total net revenues for the twelve months period ended December 31 2016 were 723 MNOK, up 35% from 2015. The growth in revenues come partly from the acquisition of Nansen representing NOK 143m of the total net revenues for the period. Excluding Nansen the organic growth in net revenues were 46 MNOK equal to 9%.
The EBITDA for the twelve months period ended December 31 2016 came in at 43.8 MNOK, compared to 20.7 MNOK for the same period in 2015. Nansen represents 26 MNOK of the EBITDA. Reported EBITDA includes 24.8 MNOK in non-recurring cost, mainly related to the Nansen transaction and restructuring costs related to StudioNoc. Adjusted for non-recurring cost, EBITDA for the period is 68.6 MNOK.

Outlook
We expect the positive development to continue. The focus is now to utilize NOA's Nordic digital capabilities as efficient as possible and be ready for further growth and positive margin development across the region.

Note 4 Estimates, judgments and assumptions
The preparation of interim financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In preparing these condensed interim financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 and condensed interim financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2016.

Note 6 Seasonality
Historically we have seen a higher activity level in Q3 and Q4 compared to Q1 and Q2. The main factors explaining this are the higher number of marketing campaigns that typically are run by our clients in Q3 and Q4, and the fact that Q3 and Q4 in total have more hours available for client deliveries, adjusted for holidays during the summer.
