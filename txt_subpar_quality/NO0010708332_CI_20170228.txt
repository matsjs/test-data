Jacob Holm & Sons AG Group
Restatement of the Annual Report for 2015 As disclosed in the annual report 2015 note 29 the covenant ratio on credit institution loans in relation to EBITDA/fixed charges was in breach at the end of Q4 2015 and subsequently waived. Although subsequently waived, the loans were considered current under IFRS. This has been adjusted in the comparative figures as of December 31,2015. Due to cross-default provisions, this also applies for the bond resulting in a total amount of DKK 798 million being reclassified from non-current to current liabilities in the annual report and DKK 864 million in the attached report. The reclassification does not affect net profit for the year, other comprehensive income or equity.
