Revenues and profits for the Group -1H 2014
Introduction Salar Bidco AS was incorporated 22. February 2013. SalarLux Parent S.a.r.l. owns Salar Topco AS who owns Salar Midco AS 100% and who in its turn owns Salar Bidco AS 100%. The Salar Bidco group was established 31. May 2013 following the acquisition of the Pharmaq group by funds ultimately advised by Permira. As a consequence, consolidated accounts for the Group have been prepared as from 1. June 2013. Pro-forma financial information for the first half year 2013 is used for comparison purposes in the discussions below.

The profit and loss statement pre non-recurring items are adjusted for certain non-recurring items as further commented below. Note 3 to the accounts illustrate the bridge to the official reported 1H 2014 results for the group.

Pro forma

Revenues and volumes Revenues for 1H 2014 were NOK 247 million versus last year (LY) of NOK 261 million. 1H 2014 revenues reflect stronger positions in the UK and Norwegian salmonid vaccine markets and for the sea bass and sea bream markets in the Mediterranean region. We have particularly seen strong growth in the Spanish bass and bream market, where Pharmaq has achieved an improved market position during the period. Revenues in Chile were lower than the same period last year primarily due to certain temporary supply challenges that was resolved during July.

Revenues from sea lice treatment products grew in the first half of 2014, particularly in the Norwegian and Scottish markets, while a shift in the number of available products has impacted revenues in Chile during the period.

Pharmaq received a license for the first generation Pangasius vaccine in Vietnam in 1H2013 and has made considerable efforts during the period to convert the farming industry from using antibiotics into vaccine treatment for diseases. To further extend the product portfolio, Pharmaq continues to invest to develop new vaccines for the region.

EBITDA - pre non-recurring items EBITDA pre non-recurring items for 1H 2014 were NOK 37 million versus NOK 44 million LY, mainly due to the supply challenges in Chile during June.

EBITDA pre non recurring items excludes a NOK 32 million purchase price allocation effect (PPA) related to revaluation of inventories to sales values as of the completion date of the acquisition by funds advised by Permira. The revaluation impact is expensed as part of cost

of goods sold when inventories are sold. Further, EBITDA pre non-recurring items include a charge of NOK 9.7 million in 1H 2014 that relates to one batch of vaccines produced for the Chilean market. Following Pharmaqs high standard quality test program this batch was considered out of specifications and therefore scrapped, which historically has almost been non existent for the company. Corrective actions have been implemented in order to reduce the risk for any similar future incidents.
Financial position The Salar Bidco group had net interest bearing debt of NOK 621 million by end of 1H 2014, including available cash of NOK 115 million. The group also has a revolving credit facility of NOK 100 million, out of which NOK 7.5 million is drawn.
Total assets were NOK 2 296 million by the end of 1H 2014 of which NOK 459 million were current assets. Equity ratio by end of June 2014 was 55.1%.
Cash flow Net cash outflow from operating activities was NOK 59 million for 1H 2014 primarily as a result of seasonal increase in working capital with higher accounts receivables in June due to strong vaccine sales in Scotland and Norway. In addition, inventory stock up in order to meet the primary vaccination season in third and fourth quarter impacted the working capital.
The group executed a NOK 22 mill option in 1H 2014 to acquire the laboratory at Skøyen initially financed by the property owner. This was part of the supplier debt by year end 2013 and the transaction was executed in January 2014.
Net cash outflow from investment activities was NOK 18 million.
Net cash inflow from financing activities for the period was NOK 42 million from the successful bond issue of NOK 725 million by the end of March 2014 that replaced the group bank loans.
The change in cash and cash equivalents in 1H 2014 was an outflow of NOK 35 million.
Business outlook The global salmonid vaccine industry continues to develop in a positive way and Pharmaq has overall maintained its strong position. The company has several new products under development that will be essential for salmon farmers to secure an improved fish health status.
The sea bass and sea bream markets are stable and Pharmaq is focusing on improving its market position as well as securing a good product offering to its customers.
Pharmaq is also increasing its efforts in both the Pangasius market in Vietnam and the Tilapia markets in Asia and Americas to present new vaccine products to new and existing customers that will have a long term positive impact on the development of the company.
The Salar Bidco group has received special sales permits of the following new products in the reporting period illustrating the results from the considerable research and development activities in the group;
· A one component immersion vaccine complementing the product portfolio in Turkey · The first vaccine for lumpsucker fish in the Norwegian market (August 2014) · A multicomponent vaccine including ISA for the Canadian market · A three component vaccine for the sea bass and sea bream market in Spain · A monovalent autogenous VNN virus vaccine in Greece · A monovalent vaccine for Tilapia registered in Panama and Costa Rica
