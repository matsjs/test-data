To the bondholders in:
ISIN NO 001 056160.8 - Marine Subsea Cyprus Holding Ltd Exchange Bond -- Series I Bond Issue 2009/2019
Oslo, 23 December 2011
Ad. Interest payment due 16 September 2011 and 16 December 2011 Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as Loan Trustee for the above-captioned bond issue (the "Loan") where Marine Subsea Cyprus Holdings is issuer (the "Issuer"). Reference is made to the notice dated 15 September 2011 regarding the suspension of the interest payment due 16 September 2011 (the "Notice"). Pursuant to the agreement dated 14 December 2009, the Issuer has the opportunity to make any of the first eight interest payments as Payment-in-Kind (i.e. as additional bonds) if the amount of interest due exceeds Available Cash. The Issuer confirmed that this was the case and the interest payment due 16 September 2011 (the "September PIK") and 16 December 2011 (the "December PIK") will be made as Payment-in-Kind. However, as reported in the Notice, the September PIK was postponed. A bondholders' meeting 13 December 2011 approved a transaction which is assumed to be closed in the near future (the "Transaction"). In anticipation of a closing of the Transaction it is necessary to make both the September PIK and the December PIK. This has to be done in order to facilitate the allocation of cash and in particular the allocation of shares in Offshore Accommodation IS, subsequent to closing. September PIK Record Date: 21 December 2011 Payment Date: 23 December 2011 In total 9,094,893 Bonds has been paid as the September PIK, equal to the interest due 16 September 2011 plus interest of 12 %, on the interest amount, for 90 days ("Added September Interest").

In total 8,829,986 Bonds has been paid as December PIK, equalling the interest due 16 December 2011 minus the Added September Interest.
General comments
The new outstanding amount under the Loan will be USD 312,258,635 which significantly exceeds what can be expected to be repaid by the Issuer. A closing of the Transaction is anticipated in the near future, but no guarantees are given by NTM. Any confirmation of a closing of the Transaction and any related details will be made in a separate notice.
Best regards Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
