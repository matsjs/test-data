UPDATE FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2017
During the first half of 2017, the Company continued to provide IT housing solutions to its sole customer, EVRY.
For the half year ended 30 June 2017, the Company's operating revenues totalled NOK 66.2 million, which reflects an increase of NOK 30.4 million compared to the operating revenue of NOK 35.7 million reported in the same period last year. The majority of the increase, approximately NOK 23.9 million, relates to an increase in added value services, whilst the remaining NOK 6.5 million is due to receiving a full half year's revenue.
Operating expenses totalled NOK 35.2 million, which comprised of NOK 34.2 million of cost of goods sold, operational and management support costs; and NOK 1.0 million of personnel costs. The increase in operating expenses of NOK 20.5 million compared to the same period last year is largely due to the costs of providing the added value services, as described above, of approximately NOK 22.0 million offset by a net decrease of NOK 1.6 million in other operating expenses.
EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortisation) for the half year was NOK 30.9 million, which is 47% higher than the EBITDA reported in the same period last year.
A charge of NOK 16.9 million was made to reflect depreciation of the plant and equipment, and the Company incurred net finance costs of circa NOK 13.2 million, compared to NOK 19.5 million and NOK 14.2 million respectively in the same period last year.
In light of the above, the profit before income tax for the half year came in at NOK 0.9 million, compared to a loss before income tax of NOK 12.7 million in the same period last year.
Cash generated from operations was NOK 30.7 million, compared to NOK 35.4 million in the same period last year.
Borrowings totalled NOK 495.7 million as at 30 June 2017, which reflects the Bond Issue completed in June 2014, which remains largely unchanged from last year end. There were no movements in shareholder loans in the first half of 2017 with the balance remaining at NOK 269.1 million.
As at 30 June 2017, cash and cash equivalents stood at NOK 48.6 million compared to NOK 39.5 million at the end of 2016.
