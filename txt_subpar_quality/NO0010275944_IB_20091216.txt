With reference to the Summons, warrants to be issued to the NEC bonds will be issued to the outstanding bonds at the date of completion of the refinancing. NEC02, NEC03, NEC04 and NEC05 bonds will be issued their pro rata share of the 55 430 000 warrants and the allocation of warrants to the individual bonds, denominated in NOK and USD, will be fixed on the FX rate at the date before the date of allocation of the warrants. As an example given the current NOK/USD FX rate of 5.78x and the current outstanding bonds, NOK 1 million of bonds will be allocated approx. 90,240 warrants (521,590 warrants per USD 1 million of bonds). As set out in the Summons, the warrants' exercise price will be based on the first 5 days volume weighted average price following the demerger or in the case of a market placement of shares at the time of listing.
