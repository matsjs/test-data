HARKAND EMEA GROUP
Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Aggregated Financial Statements
1. Basis of preparation
The Harkand EMEA Group was created on 28 March 2014 and includes the companies listed in note 5. The unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements reflect the performance of Harkand EMEA Group for the six month period ended 30 June 2015.
As there is no common parent the financial statements for the Harkand EMEA Group have been prepared by aggregating relevant sub-group consolidations. Intercompany balances and transactions between the sub-groups are eliminated as appropriate in arriving to the aggregated financial statements.
The European and African operational businesses of Harkand Luxembourg Holdings SARL were transferred to Harkand EMEA Group on 16 April 2014. The Group is required to prepare aggregated financial statements based upon International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") by the bond agreement signed on 28 March 2014.
Going concern
The unaudited condensed interim aggregated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors believe to be appropriate for the following reasons.
During the three months ended 30 June 2015 the Directors successfully completed the strategic plan and cost-reduction measures disclosed in the audited aggregated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2014. These included deferral of bond repayments, reducing the cost base of the Group and committed funding from Group's shareholder. The combination of these actions has provided greater stability in challenging market conditions. The EMEA Group has seen the benefit as it continues to win work in the North Sea as well as striving forward in its strategy to penetrate the African market.
2. Statement of compliance These unaudited condensed interim aggregated financial statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and they have not been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"). However selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group's financial position and performance since date of incorporation.
3. Summary of estimates, judgements and assumptions
The preparation of the Group's condensed unaudited interim aggregated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim consolidated financial statements. However, uncertainty about these estimates, judgements and assumptions could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.

HARKAND EMEA GROUP Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Aggregated Financial Statements
4. Summary of significant accounting policies New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted The Group adopted the following standards on 1 January 2014: Amendments to IAS 32, Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The amendments in IAS 32 clarify certain items regarding offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively and will be effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014 with earlier application permitted. The amendment has had no impact on the Group's financial presentation or performance.

HARKAND EMEA GROUP
Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Aggregated Financial Statements
4. New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted (continued)
Amendments to IAS 36, Impairment of Assets These narrow-scope amendments to IAS 36 address the disclosure of information about the recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. Earlier application is permitted for periods when the entity has already applied IFRS 13. The standard has had no impact on the Group's financial position or performance.
IFRIC Interpretation 21, Levies The interpretation clarifies that an entity recognizes a liability for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. It also clarifies that a levy liability is accrued progressively only if the activity that triggers payment occurs over a period of time, in accordance with the relevant legislation. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the interpretation clarifies that no liability should be recognized before the specified minimum threshold is reached. The standard has had no impact on the Group's financial position or performance. New standards, interpretations and amendments thereof not yet effective Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group's interim aggregated financial statements are listed below. This listing of standards and interpretations issued are those that the Group reasonably expects to have an impact on disclosures, financial position or performance when applied at a future date. The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective.
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement IFRS 9 as issued reflects the first phase of the IASB's work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The mandatory date of adoption for this standard has not been set. The Group will continue to assess any impact on the classification and measurement of the Group's financial assets, as well as any impact on the classification and measurement of financial liabilities. IFRS 9 is not yet approved by the EU. IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers The IASB and FASB published a new joint revenue standard on revenue recognition in May 2014. It replaces existing IFRS and US GAAP guidance and introduces a new recognition model for contracts with customers. The new standard (IFRS 15) retains a principles-based approach to the recognition of revenue from contracts. It introduces new concepts for obligations satisfied over time, or at a point in time. In particular, IFRS 15 may change the way many complex, long-term or multiple component contracts are accounted for. The new standard is not yet approved by the EU but will be effective for periods commencing 1 January 2017.

The Group leases various office, warehouse properties and Vessels under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. The lease terms are between 2 years and 12 years, and the majority of lease arrangements are renewable at the end of the lease period at market rate. There are no restrictions placed upon the lessee by entering into these leases.
15. Commitments Contingent liabilities
A member of senior management participates in a long term incentive plan ("LTIP") that is run by Harkand Global Holdings Limited. This is a cash based LTIP where value crystallises for the individuals only on the sale of 80% or more of the equity in Harkand Global Holdings Limited by its shareholders or a similar exit event. No accounting entries have been made in relation to this scheme given that the liability is contingent at the balance sheet date. The Directors do not believe that a reliable estimate of the contingent liability can be made at the balance sheet date given the level of estimation uncertainty at that date.

Harkand EMEA Group Management Discussion and Analysis Quarter ended 30 June 2015
General information
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Harkand EMEA Group ("EMEA") is the provision of subsea services (survey, inspection, repair, maintenance and light construction) to the international oil and gas industry. The Group's mission is to offer a high quality and cost effective service with a strong emphasis on safety and operational efficiency to the fast-growing subsea integrity management market.
Business review
EMEA carries out operations in the North Sea and West Africa, and represents the majority of its revenues and assets. EMEA has a long established presence in the North Sea, and is a leading provider of diving, ROV and survey services in the region. Over the past two years EMEA has also established a strong presence in West Africa, and during the prior year transitioned management of the Africa region to its Houston office, which has considerable experience of running operations in Africa.
EMEA was created through the combination of three businesses:
 Andrews Survey was founded in Aberdeen in 1978. By 2007 it had grown to a leading contractor in the hydrographic and subsea survey sector in the North Sea. In 2007 it was acquired by ISS.
 Harkand UK (formerly ISS) was founded in Aberdeen in 2002. By 2011 it had grown to become a leading provider of diving and ROV services in its core North Sea market, with regional offices in Singapore, Australia and Azerbaijan. It was acquired by Oaktree in 2012 and combined with Iremis.
 Harkand West Africa (formerly Iremis) was founded by Oaktree in 2011 with the acquisition of the Atlantis and Da Vinci vessels. Based in UAE, its key markets were West Africa and the North Sea. Oaktree's acquisition of ISS in 2012 allowed the creation of the Harkand Group in 2013, bringing Harkand's vessels access to and utilisation in the North Sea market.
The three businesses were highly complementary, combining Iremis' modern high-end assets with ISS and Andrews Survey's extended range of services.
EMEA owns the key assets of the Harkand Group: Two state-of-the-art DSVs, the Atlantis and the Da Vinci, and the Harkand Group's entire fleet of 32 ROVs. The Group operates 22 ROVs itself, while the remaining 10 ROVs are chartered to other companies within the Harkand Group.
Future developments
The formation of the Harkand Group provides a strong commercial, technical, financial and governance platform from which to consolidate the industry and create a market-leading name in subsea inspection, repair, maintenance and survey of offshore oil and gas fields. The Harkand Group is focused on attaining the highest standards in health, safety, quality and environmental performance along with first class project execution.

Commentary on financial performance
Key performance highlights during the quarter ended 30 June 2015 were:
 Utilisation improves in the North Sea  Sell rates reduced as longer-term contracts won offset by some high value work  Survey performance stable  Continued progress in West Africa
Utilisation improves in the North Sea
Utilisation improved overall, which was driven by the Atlantis and the Go Electra however offset by the Da Vinci.
The Atlantis has been working ahead of expected utilisation due to the recently won frame agreements. The Go Electra achieved excellent utilisation on its contract during the quarter. The Da Vinci has suffered lower utilisation being the combination of delayed projects and maintenance work.
The Spearfish arrived in the North Sea at the end of the quarter as expected and was deployed immediately on its project.
Sell rates reduced as longer-term contracts won offset by some high value work
The Atlantis rate was lower than expected as it worked on an alternative contract than planned. The Go Electra rate was higher than projected due to the type of work required by the client.
Rates were lower in the North Sea across all vessels in May. Atlantis rate down as a result of the work it is doing on frame agreements albeit utilisation is better. The Da Vinci and the Go Electra rates were up in June due to two projects for ROV structures and diving in June.
Survey performance stable
The Survey business performed in line with expectations.
Continued progress in West Africa
Work continues well on the contract won in Nigeria. Further bids have been made and the Group is confident that new contracts will be awarded in the near future.

HARKAND FINANCE INC.
Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Reporting entity
The Company was incorporated on 3 March 2014 and is domiciled in the Marshall Islands.
On 28 March 2014 the Company completed the issue of secured senior notes ("Bond"). In connection with the release of the proceeds from the Bond, the Company became the owner through its two subsidiary companies, of two Dive Support Vessels ("DSVs"). The DSVs are chartered to related companies, which are market-leading global names in subsea inspection, repair, maintenance and survey of offshore oil and gas fields.
2. Statement of compliance
These interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and using the same accounting policies and methods as were used for the Group's annual financial statements and notes for the year ended 31 December 2014. These interim consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") for annual financial statements. Accordingly, these interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Group's annual financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014 and the accompanying notes.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies
Going concern
The unaudited condensed interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors believe to be appropriate for the following reasons.
During the three months ended 30 June 2015 the Directors successfully completed the strategic plan and cost-reduction measures disclosed in the audited financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2014. The combination of these actions, which included deferral of bond repayments, has provided greater stability in challenging market conditions.
4. Summary of estimates, judgements and assumptions
The preparation of the Group's interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim consolidated financial statements. However, uncertainty about these estimates, judgements and assumptions could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
There has been no substantial change in the Group's critical accounting estimates since the annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014. The comparative interim consolidated financial statements have been reclassified from statements previously presented to conform to the presentation of the 30 June 2015 interim consolidated financial statements.

Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Reporting entity
The Company was incorporated on 4 March 2014 and is domiciled in the Gibraltar.
On 28 March 2014 the Company completed the issue of secured senior notes ("Bond"). In connection with the release of the proceeds from the Bond, the Company became the owner through its two subsidiary companies, of two Dive Support Vessels ("DSVs"). The DSVs are chartered to related companies, which are market-leading global names in subsea inspection, repair, maintenance and survey of offshore oil and gas fields.
2. Statement of compliance
These interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and using the same accounting policies and methods as were used for the Group's annual financial statements and notes for the year ended 31 December 2014. These interim consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") for annual financial statements. Accordingly, these interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Group's annual financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014 and the accompanying notes.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies
Going concern
The unaudited condensed interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors believe to be appropriate for the following reasons.
During the three months ended 30 June 2015 the Directors successfully completed the strategic plan and cost-reduction measures disclosed in the audited financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2014. The combination of these actions, which included deferral of bond repayments, has provided greater stability in challenging market conditions.
4. Summary of estimates, judgements and assumptions
The preparation of the Group's interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim consolidated financial statements. However, uncertainty about these estimates, judgements and assumptions could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
There has been no substantial change in the Group's critical accounting estimates since the annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014. The comparative interim consolidated financial statements have been reclassified from statements previously presented to conform to the presentation of the 30 June 2015 interim consolidated financial statements.
