Information to Bondholders - Late interest payment

Reference is made to the interest payments due 19 December 2016 (the "Interest Payments") to the bonds mentioned above (together the "Bonds").
Nordea Bank Norge ASA is the paying agent for the Bonds (the "Paying Agent").
Due to technical difficulties in the payment interface between the Paying Agent and Nets, the interest payments were made on 20 December 2016. The Bondholders in the abovementioned Bonds are therefore entitled to default interest for late payment (the "Default Interest").
The Paying Agent has informed us that the Default Interest will be paid on the next interest payment date of the relevant bond.

Yours sincerely Nordic Trustee ASA

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo
