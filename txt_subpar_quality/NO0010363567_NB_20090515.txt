Notice from Bondholders' Meeting
On 15 May 2009 a Bondholders' meeting was held pursuant to summons dated 6 May 2009 regarding a postponement of the instalment due on 5 May 2009. There were sufficient Bondholders present at the meeting to form a quorum. The proposed resolution obtained 10.80% of the votes, which, according to the voting requirements of the Loan Agreement, was not sufficient for adoption. The Loan Agreement will remain unchanged. Consequently, as no postponement is resolved, and the instalment is not paid, the Borrower is in'breach of the Loan Agreement.
