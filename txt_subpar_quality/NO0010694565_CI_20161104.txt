Net financial expence in 3ndquarter were NOK 15,7 million resulting in a pre-tax loss of NOK 12,0 million in 3ndquarter. The Company is in breach of its obligations under the loanagreement. The lenders have, in spite of the default, asked the board and management to continue the operations of the Company and not file for bankruptcy. In this respect an agreement has been entered into reflected in the chapter on financial risk. As a result of the Company being in breach of its loan agreements the Company cannot report financially as a going concern.

The working capital was NOK -1 231,3 million at 30.09.2016 compared to NOK -1 280,9 million at 31.12.2015.
Market outlook The Company is facing a long period of depressed market rates. On a global basis approx. 500 OSV are in lay-up and approx. 100 OSVs are in lay up in the North Sea. Investment budgets for the oil companies are still being reduced contracting the demand for oil service assets. The board does not expect any consistent market improvement for several years.
Financial risk The major financial risk confronting the Company is that it is in breach of its obligations under the loan agreement. Interest has not been paid since August 2015. This default has not been waived by the lenders but they have agreed to leave interest falling due as unpaid until further notice. Since the Company is constantly taking on new debt in form of new trade creditors, the lenders have agreed to allow the company the use of its cash to pay these, even in the case of an enforcement of the securities.
Employees The Group had at the end of 3ndquarter 37 employees of which 34 sailors including hired personnel.
