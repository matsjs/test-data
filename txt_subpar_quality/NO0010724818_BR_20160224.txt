Quarterly Report
Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains forward-looking statements that relate to future events, including our future operating results and conditions, our prospects and our future financial performance and condition, all of which are largely based on our current expectations and projections. Known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. It is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the potential impact of these factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statement. These factors include, but are not limited to, (i) the downturn in oil markets and increased competition among offshore drillers, (ii) availability of capital and credit market volatility, (iii) local and global economic conditions, (iv) our anticipated growth strategies, (v) political, economic and financial pressures that impact our sole customer, PEMEX, and (vi) our future business development, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, our business model is highly leveraged, we have only one customer, PEMEX, and we operate in a highly competitive market, so new risk factors may emerge from time to time. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by words or phrases such as "may", "will", "expect", "anticipate", "target", "aim", "estimate", "intend", "plan", "believe", "potential", "continue", "is/are likely to" or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements made in this report relate only to events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in this report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should read this report with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect.

Company Highlights
Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro S.A.P.I. de C.V. (referred to as "Oro Negro" or the "Company" herein) reports revenues of US$49.0M during the fourth quarter of 2015, in line with the US$50.9M registered during the third quarter of 2015.
Like every business in our industry, Oro Negro is facing significant challenges. Our challenges are a direct result of the challenges our only customer, PEMEX, also faces. We continue to partner with PEMEX to address the collective issues we face, but these challenges directly and negatively impacted our liquidity, which remains extremely limited. As a result, the Company must continue to make difficult choices on the timing for paying its obligations, while simultaneously ensuring that our rigs are operating safely and consistent with the expectations of PEMEX. The Company did not pay the outstanding principal and accrued interest in respect of the First Priority Oro Negro Impetus Pte.Ltd. Senior Secured Bond Issue 2014/2015 (the "2015 bonds" and referred to herein as the "US$175.0M bridge bond"), which amounts were due as of the maturity date of the 2015 Bonds on December 4, 2015. We are currently engaged in discussions with advisors representing an ad hoc committee of holders of our 2015 bonds and an ad hoc committee of holders of the 7.50% Oro Negro Drilling Pte. Ltd. Senior Secured Bond Issue 2014/2019 (referred to herein as the "US$725.0M bond") to effect a comprehensive restructuring of our long-term debt.
Despite recent financial difficulties, the Company continued to successfully execute on its operational strategy during the fourth quarter. Oro Negro's fleet achieved another quarter with high uptime levels, registering an average uptime of 99.5% during the fourth quarter of 2015. Primus and Fortius ended the fourth quarter with an uptime of 100.0%, offering the best performance of Oro Negro's fleet, followed by Decus and Laurus with average uptimes of 99.3% and 98.9% respectively.
Rig 3's contract ended on July 11th, the platform is expected to obtain new contract for a minimum of 6 months during the second quarter of 2016.
Operational Results
As of December 31, 2015, our fleet consists of five premium jack-ups and one modular rig, building enough scale to generate substantial operating synergies, and to position the Company as a relevant operator of high specification equipment in Mexico, with five of our rigs already under contract with PEMEX.
In December 2015, the Company secured a 5-year contract with Pemex for the Impetus Rig to start operations during the first quarter of 2016.
Oro Negro is committed to maintain the highest safety and environmental responsibility standards. We operate a Quality Management System (QMS) with its principles founded in our ZERO HARM policies; which are based upon ZERO HARM to people, environment, and equipment. No major incidents were reported during the fourth quarter of 2015.

Jack-up Contracts

We have been able to build a large contract backlog and provide a stable cash flow visibility for the upcoming years. The following table sets forth the amount of revenue backlog for our drilling units under contract as of December 31, 2015:

Contract backlog is calculated by multiplying the day rate of our drilling contracts by the number of contract days remaining, assuming a full uptime rate. The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation, customer reimbursable, and bonuses.
It is worth noting that as a part of the day rate renegotiation with Pemex, which reflects a day rate of US$130k for a 12-month period starting June 2015, the Company signed an amendment to the contracts of the rigs under operation providing one additional year of contract extension per jack-up5.
Oro Negro's rigs are currently located in the bay of Campeche based in the Mexican Gulf of Mexico performing both exploratory and development drilling activities for PEMEX.

Management, Discussion and Analysis
(As of December 31st, 2015)

Quarterly Report

Balance sheet

As of December 31, 2015, total assets amounted to US$1,473.2M. Current assets totaled US$156.0M, mainly comprised by trade and other receivables (US$112.8M), and cash and equivalents (US$40.9M). Total long-term assets added up to US$1,317.2M.
Trade and other receivables are comprised of accounts receivables from PEMEX (US$97.2M), recoverable taxes (US$15.6M), and other receivables (US$1.1M).
Cash and cash equivalents balance totaled US$40.9M at the end of the period of which US$3.4M were identified as available cash, US$4.2M were reserved for debt service, US$29.4M were classified as restricted cash to comply with the liquidity reserve of our outstanding debt, and US$3.9M were provisioned for major maintenance and for the inspection that each jack-up undergoes every 5 years.
Fixed assets amounted to US$1,283.1M. These are composed by property and equipment (rigs already delivered), and advanced payments made for the rigs under construction, additional adaptations to the rigs, and pre-operational expenses.
Total liabilities added up to US$949.7M, of which US$248.7M are considered current liabilities, mainly composed of current portion of long-term debt US$210.3M, trade and other payables US$22.6M, other short term liabilities US$8.1M, current portion of deferred revenue US$7.6M, and US$701.0M are long-term liabilities.
Total debt at the end of the period was US$886.0M, which is composed by the US$725.0M bond issued in January, 2014, and the US$175.0M bridge bond issued in December 2014.
Given that under IFRS borrowings are recognized at fair value in the balance sheet, net of transaction costs, and transaction costs are amortized throughout the financing term, the balance sheet will reflect the total debt principal until the maturity date.
(Fourth quarter of 2015)

Income statement
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015, ended on December 31, 2015, amounted to US$49.0M compared to US$50.9M obtained during the third quarter of 2015.
Revenues are generated from the operation of our drilling rigs, including four premium jack-ups and one modular rig. The company achieved a 99.5% uptime during the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenues have decreased given the contract renegotiation with PEMEX for Primus, Laurus, Fortius, and Decus and to Rig 3's contract end on July 11th.

Personnel costs are the most relevant operating cost representing ~65% of the total rig direct operating costs during the third quarter of 2015. Gross profit for the fourth quarter totaled US$19.9M, increasing approximately US$9.9M compared to the third quarter of 2015.
