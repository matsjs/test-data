ISIN NO 001 027380.8 - 11.00 per cent Neptune Marine Invest AS Senior Secured Bond Issue 2005/2009 with call option

Oslo, 2 October 2006

REPLACEMENT OF MORTGAGE WITH CASH COLLATERAL AND EXERCISE OF CALL OPTION
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") acts as loan trustee for the above-captioned loan (the "Loan") where Neptune Marine Invest AS ("Neptune") is the borrower.
Originally, the Loan was secured by a first priority mortgage against the drill-ships "Neptune Discoverer" and "Neptune Explorer" (the "Mortgages").
Neptune has just refinanced and increased its debt and issued a new secured bond issue (secured i.a. by a first priority mortgage against the two drill-ships "Neptune Discoverer" and "Neptune Explorer"). In this connection the Mortgages has been replaced with cash collateral (i.e. funds are placed on a pledged and blocked escrow account in favour o f the Loan Trustee on behalf of the bondholders). The cash collateral covers remaining interest, principal payments and the call premium under the Loan.
Further, Neptune has exercised its call option and the entire Loan will be redeemed on 31 December 2006 at 103 % of par value (plus accrued interest).

Kind regards,

for Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
