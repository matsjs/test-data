Management's Review
Summary Jacob Holm & Sønner Holding A/S and its subsidiaries ("Jacob Holm", the "Company" or the "Group") con cluded its third quarter of the financial year 2017 with revenues of DKK 544 million and an EBITDA of DKK 48 million. The changes in the USD/DKK exchange rate and slightly lower volumes negatively impacted revenue compared to the previous period. However, the lower topline was compensated with a solid operational performance and a favorable product mix, resulting in an increase of EBITDA and EBITDA margin compared to Q2 2017.
