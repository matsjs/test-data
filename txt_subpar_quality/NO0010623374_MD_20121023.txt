Re. Forced Conversion Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the bond issues with ISIN NO 001 062337.4 (the "Bond Issue") with Emerging Europe Land Development AS (the "Company") as Borrower. All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Bond Agreement dated 21 October 2011 (together the "Bond Agreement").
