the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bond" or the "Bond Issue") issued by Oro Negro Drilling Pte.

Ltd. as issuer (the "Company" or the "Issuer").

According to the Bond Agreement the Bondholders were due to receive scheduled amortization as instalment on 24 July 2016 as described in clause 10.1.1 of the Bond Agreement (the "Instalment"). As a consequence of the Instalment the relevant Bonds have been drawn by the Securities Depository (the "Drawing"), and the drawn Bonds has changed status to a claim on the Company ("Drawn Bonds"). These Drawn Bonds do not appear as Bonds on the individual Bondholders securities accounts. This situation may cause some uncertainty with regards to the individual Bondholders' ability to prove their full holding with respect to the voting in future Bondholders' Meetings. The Bond Trustee and the Issuer have agreed to reinstate the situation to as it was prior to the Drawing of Bonds.

The Drawn Bonds will therefore be redelivered to the individual Bondholders securities account as ordinaiy Bonds ("Redelivery Bonds"). Technically such redelivery is done by way of the issuance of Redelivery Bonds in a ratio 1:1 which cancels the Drawn Bonds and reinstates the situation prior to the Drawing of the Bonds. The Redelivery Bonds will be delivered to the Bondholders owning the Drawn Bonds, and the Drawn Bonds will be discharged.

Please note that this is done solely in order to avoid going forward with uncertainty of the individual Bondholders' holding of Bonds, and with the added benefit for the Bondholders to regain tradable Bonds. This does not constitute settlement of the Instalments, and does not remedy this payment default. If the Bonds are accelerated the claim will include default interest on the Drawn Bonds from and including 24 July 2016. For the sake of good order, the Redelivery Bonds shall be an integral part of the Bonds issued.

Original Instalment on 24 July 2016 was USD 8.263.889, but due to misunderstandings the Securities Depository drew USD 24.000.000. This mistake was corrected on 26 July 2016, where USD 15.736.097 was redelivered back to bondholders. A second redelivery of USD 8.263.903 will find place on 1 August 2016. Below follows a detailed calculation of the Redelivery Bonds.
