Q2 2017 Update from the board of directors
Financial performance

Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its subsidiaries, hereafter "the Group", similar to Q1 2017 closed a quarter showing increased volumes in testing and surveys but still experienced continued price pressure.

The Group closed Q2 2017 with a net profit of USD 64 thousand (Q2 2016: net loss of USD 479 thousand). Excluding the exceptional expenses the net result shows a profit of USD 257 thousand in Q2 2017 (Q2 2016: net profit of 654 thousand).

Furthermore, the cost control measures continue to show effect resulting in a decrease of the expenses in Q2 in comparison to prior year. The expenses decreased to USD 8,611 thousand (Q2 2016: 8,767 thousand).

The operating cash flow in Q2 2017 was USD 428 thousand positive. The operating cash flow in comparison to prior year is impacted by a decrease in working capital versus prior year.

The Group's Q2 EBITDA decreased to USD 3,222 thousand in comparison to prior year (Q2 2016: USD 3,533 thousand). The exceptional expenses are reflecting, amongst others, the impact of the cost reduction programs.

Organizational changes There are no significant organizational changes to report on in Q2 2017.
