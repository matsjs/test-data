Re: Dissolution of certain subsidiaries
We represent the Marine Subsea group.
Marine Subsea Nigeria Ltd
In the Marine Subsea Cyprus Holding Ltd Exchange bond Series I loan agreement ("Series I"), it is assumed that Marine Subsea Nigeria Ltd ("MSN") is owned by Marine Subsea Cyprus Holding Ltd ("MSCH"). This is unfortunately not correct. MSN is today a fully registered company in Nigeria, owned by Gian Angelo Perrucci (the seller) with an issued share capital of 10 000 000 Nigerian Naira (NN) at NN1 per share (USD 66 200 with currency rate at 0,0062 NN/USD). MSN has been an empty company without any assets or commercial-, operational- or adm inistrative function. In relation to the refinancing process Marine Subsea undertook to dissolve MSN within the first quarter 2010 (ref. covenant in Clause 13.2 (w) in the "Series I" loan agreement). This is not possible as MSCH is not the rightful owner of the company shares.
However, there has recently become a need for MSCH to establish an entity in Nigeria for commercial purposes.
The benefits of having a fully registered local subsidiary includes:
1) Acceptance to pre-qualification, tendering and contract process towards local oil companies, (please see example in clause 3 "Nigerian content" in the attachm ent pre-qualification invitation from ENI)
2) Satisfying local presence requirements. There will also be employed a General Manager in the Nigeria subsidiary.
3) Easier permit procedures such as VISA, Department of Petroleum Resources license (DPR) and other operational permits.
There are three alternatives to organizing such needs:
1) Operate as a offshore company. · Marine Subsea will autom atically be excluded from pre-qualification processes with
local companies for lack of local content and is not able to acquire a DPR license which will enable the com pany to trade within the oil- and offshore m arket in Nigeria. No value added. 2) Establish a new subsidiary. · Marine Subsea would profit from the benefits of local presence. However, establishing a new company will be subjected to delayed start-up due to official processes and unnecessary added start-up costs. 3) MSCH acquires the shares in MSN from Gian Angelo Perrucci.

Wiersholm
· Marine Subsea would profit from the benefits of local presence. More efficient as MSN already is a fully registered company in Nigeria.
For this reason we submit the following request: 1) For bondholders to waive the requirement to dissolve MSN. 2) For bondholders to approve that MSCH acquires 9 999 999 ordinary shares and Marine Subsea AS acquires 1 ordinary share in the outstanding share capital in MSN. The parties have agreed that Mr Perruci will transfer the shares to MSCH and Marine Subsea AS free of charge on the condition that MSCH covers the registration fees of USD 5640.
Regarding the dissolution of Transco Navigation Ltd and Marine Subsea I Inc We refer to Series I bond loan agreem ent Clause 13.2 (w) pursuant to which MSCH shall dissolve Transco Navigation Ltd and Marine Subsea I Inc within the first financial quarter of 2010 "unless additional time is required by local laws or restrictions". Please be informed that the process for the dissolution of the Transco Navigation Ltd by the Registrar will take approximately 9-12 months. We have further been informed that the dissolution process for Marine Subsea I Inc has been started by Bruno De Boccard In Comptabilite et Gestion SA. Mr Boccard has informed us that the dissolution process will take about 15 days after the original share certificates have been couriered to him, which we will do today.
Yours sincerely for Wiersholm, Mellbye & Bech, advokatfirma AS
