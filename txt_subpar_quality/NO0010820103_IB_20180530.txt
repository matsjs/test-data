Introduction

PAN DION ENERGY

General information These interim finacial statements for Pandion Energy AS ("the Company") have been prepared to comply with the Revolving exploration finance facility agreement dated 13 November, 2017, the Borrowing base facility agreement dated 9 April 2018 and Bond terms for senior unsecured bond dated 3 April 2018. These interim financial statements have not been subject to review or audit by independent auditors.
Change in functional currency IAS 21 states that an entity is required to determine a functional currency based on the primary economic environment in which it operates and generally records foreign currency transactions. Pandion Energy has assessed that the purchase of Valhall and Hod completed 22 December 2017 triggered a change in functional currency from NOK to USD. Main drivers for the change, effective from 1 January 2018 were the associated revenues from sale of crude oil in USD and new financing in USD.

Accounting principles
These interim financial statements have been prepared on the bases of simplified IFRS pursuant to the Norwegian Accounting Act §3-9 and regulations regarding simplified application of IFRS issued by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance on 3 November 2014, thus the interim financial statements do not include all information required by simplified IFRS and should be read in conjunction with the Company annual financial statement as at 31 December 2017.

The interim financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the dates and interim periods presented. Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of results of operations or cash flows for an annual period. In preparing these interim financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

As described in the company's annual financial statements for 2017, two new accounting standards entered into force from 1 January 2018, IFRS 9 and IFRS 15. The implementation of the new standards have not had any material impact on the company's financial statements.

As this is the first interim financial statements of Pandion Energy, there are no comparable quarterly figures for earlier periods in the report. 2017 was the first year of operations for the Company, with no operating income or operating expenses during 2017.

We refer to the 2017 Financial Statements for further detailed information as to the accounting principles.

Summary of the quarter

PAN DION ENERGY

Pandion Energy reported total income of USD 27.1 million and operating profit of USD 8.6 million for the first quarter 2018. Net profit was USD 4.1 million.
Total income of USD 27.1 million was driven by revenue related to the Valhall and Hod fields, mainly from oil sales. Realised oil price was USD 67.3 per bbl.
The operating expenses amounted to USD 14.4 million, partly driven by the cost related to oil stock from the acquisition of a 10 % interest in the producing Valhall and Hod fields. The oil stock from the acquisition was valued at fair value which was higher than the expected production cost per bbl.

Summary of the quarter

PAN DION ENERGY

Operational review Production from the Valhall and Hod fields was 3.8 kboed net to Pandion during first quarter. The production was lower than forecasted, caused by two periods of adverse weather conditions with negative impact on regularity, and a corresponding production efficiency of 84 percent for the quarter. The 2018 IP drilling programme at Valhall consists of three new wells. The first of these wells is currently being stimulated and is planned to start production in the second quarter. The second well is currently being drilled, and is expected to start production in the third quarter. Meanwhile, the Maersk Invincible rig continued the successful P&A campaign at Valhall.
The Ministry of Petroleum and Energy approved the plan for development and operation (PDO) for Valhall Flank on 23 March 2018, where Panion Energy has a 10% interest. The project aim to continue the development of the Tor formation on the western flank of the Valhall field. Net to Pandion capital expenditures are estimated to NOK 550 million over 2018-2020.
In January 2018 Pandion Energy was awarded two new prospective exploration licenses, PL 912 and PL 929 under the 2017 Norwegian APA (Awards in Pre-defined Areas) License Round on the NCS. Both licenses are located in the Norwegian North Sea.
