The holders of the Bonds (as defined below)

Dear Sir/Madam,

Re: 9.25 per cent Mosvold Drilling Ltd. Senior Secured Bond Issue 2005/2010 with Call Option (the "Bonds")/Conference Call

Last week it was reported that the board of SeaDrill Limited is contemplating starting discussions with the board of Mosvold Drilling Ltd. in respect of a cash offer to the shareholders of Mosvold Drilling Ltd. Such offer, it was further reported, has been made conditional on SeaDrill finding a financing solution with Mosvoid's creditors (including holders of the Bonds).

In light of the above we - on behalf of three institutions holding approximately 20% of the Bonds - hereby invite you to join us for a conference call to discuss the best way to deal with the plans announced by
SeaDrill. Details for the conference call are as follows:

Date : Time : Dial-in : PIN :

Tuesday 20 December 2005 2 pm UK Time + 44 207 075 6551 / 0800 376 4751 (Toll free) 350710#

Please let me (+44 207 851 6065 / pdeclercq@brownrudnick.com) or my colleague Mark Dorff (+44 207 851 6005 / mdorff@brownrudnick.com) know in advance if you plan to attend the above call. There are toll free numbers available for people calling from outside of the UK.

Thanks very much.
