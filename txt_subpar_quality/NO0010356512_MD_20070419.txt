To the bondholders in:
ISIN NO 001 035651.2 - FRN Aker American Shipping ASA Senior Unsecured Callable PIK Bond Issue 2007/2012
Oslo, 19 April 2007
Ad. First interest payment due 28 May 2007 as Payment-in-Kind
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as Loan Trustee for the above-captioned bond issue (the "Loan") where Aker American Shipping ASA is issuer (the "Issuer").
Pursuant to the loan agreement, the Issuer has the opportunity to make any of the first twelve quarterly interest payments as Payment-in-Kind (i.e. as additional bonds). Pursuant to the loan agreement, if Payment-in-Kind is selected, information thereof shall be given on or before the start of the relevant interest period - a deadline that was incorporated in the loan agreement at the end of the finalizing of the loan agreement. There is no such deadline in the term sheet. As regards the interest payment due 28 May 2007, notification should have been given before settlement date/disbursement date. Unfortunately, the Issuer failed to comply with this deadline when the loan agreement was completed. The Issuer has all along assumed that the interest payment due 28 May 2007 to be paid in kind. Therefore, the Issuer requests to make the interest payment due 28 May 2007 as Payment-in-Kind in stead of cash payment even though the deadline pursuant to the loan agreement is expired.
It should be taken under considering that the deadline was incorporated m a late stage of the finalizing of the loan agreement and after the completion of the term sheet, and that this is the first interest payment. Therefore, NTM propose that the Issuer shall be allowed to make the interest payment due 28 May 2007 as Payment-in-Kind. Pursuant to the loan agreement, such decision may not be approved by NTM alone if any bondholder submits a written protest against the proposal. Therefore, if no bondholders submit a written protest within 4 May 2007 against the proposal, the first interest payment due 28 May 2007 will be made as Payment-in-Kind. However, if any bondholder submits a written protest within 4 May 2007, the first interest payment due 28 May 2007 will be made as cash payment. Any written protest must be sent to NTM via regular mail, telefax or email (please see address etc. at the bottom of the page).

Best regards

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
