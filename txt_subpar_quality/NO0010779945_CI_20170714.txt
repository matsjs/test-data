Pool structure and mechanisms
Main principles - Legal setup, pool managers and TC contracts
· Legal entity / pool manager:  As this is an internal pool arrangement between the original Solstad fleet and the Solship Invest 1 AS vessels, no separate legal entities will be established as "Pool managers" for the various pools  The two operating companies Solstad Shipping AS and Rem Maritime AS (TBN Solstad Maritme AS) will be acting as a manager for the vessels in the combined Solstad/Rem fleet, regardless of whether the vessels are in a pool or not
· TC contracts:  The respective managers will act as commercial managers towards third parties (clients), and enter into contracts with clients as managers on behalf of each vessel owning subsidiary - I.e. the vessel owners are parties to the contracts with clients - Vessel owners are creditors for the charter income of the relevant vessel, thus clients pay TC rate directly to the vessel owner - Existing earnings pledges are thus not affected
· Pool agreement:  Pool agreement to govern main principles and separate participation agreements/attachments to be made for each vessel governing different elements, such as entry/exit «rules» from pool, poolpoints, calculation of pool results, suspentions during periodic planned maintenance, etc.  Each vessel owner will enter into a Pool agreement with the pool managers (pool managers will enter agreements on behalf of the pool managers and the other vessel owning entities)
The sole purpose of the pool arrangement is to ensure fair allocation of earnings among similar vessels, so that vessel owning subsidiary and its respective lenders are not discriminated

Pool structure and mechanisms

Calculation of "Pool EBITDA" and flow of funds
· Vessel EBITDA:
 Vessel revenues is defined as all TC revenues generated by a vessel
 Vessel opex is defined as all ordinary, actual operating cost per vessel
- Opex is NOT including dry docking or other upgrade capex, this will be paid for by each vessel owning subsidiary
- Low overhead cost due to limited changes in formalities, daily operation and management
- Vessel revenues minus vessel opex is defined as vessel EBITDA
· Allocation scheme - The share of "pool EBITDA" allocated to each vessel in a pool is derived from a pool point system:  A reference vessel is identified and assigned 100 points in each pool
 The other vessels in that pool are assigned 100+/- points based on key technical features and age compared to the reference vessels
 "Pool EBITDA" is then allocated to each vessel based on that vessels relative share of pool points in that pool at the end of each month
· Flow of funds:
 Each vessel owner gets paid the TC rate directly and handles all opex internally, and calculates vessel EBITDA at the end of each month
 The pool manager then aggregates all vessel EBITDA to total "pool EBITDA", and calculates allocation according to the pool points
 Vessel owners are then instructed to pay/receive surplus/deficit EBITDA compared of their share of the "Pool EBITDA" as defined by the pool point system
 Intercompany balances kept at a minimum through monthly settlements

Pool structure and mechanisms
Pool points and special events

Calculations of pool points
· The pool arrangement evaluation principles are based on objective, independently verifiable criteria and parameters such as age, size, equipment and marketability
· Pool points are calculated based on the following parameters:

· PSV pools
 Age: -2 per year before 2010, +1 per year after 2010
 DP1 (AUT): -5  Flag ex NOR: -5  Mud capacity >800m3: +5  Stby: +2
· CSV pools
 Age: +/-1 peryear, basis 2010  DP3(AUTRO): +2  ROV*: +5
· AHTS' pools
 Age: +/-1 peryear, basis 2010  ROV*: +5

Flfl: +2* LN G :+2 Accom <35: +2* De-Ice: +5* NOFO: +5*
SPS: +5 CSV M Crane >139 +5 CSV L crane >251 +5
A-frame*: +10 Flag ex NOR: -5

Definitions:
DP: Dynamic position system as per class notification Flag: PSV/AHTS are indirectly not able to fully trade Norwegian continental shelf with NIS or foreign flag, this reflected in point deduction due to not full marked coverage Mud capacity (PSVs): Drilling fluid, some tender/drilling operations require >800m3
* When in use/CP requirement

Stby: Vessel with stand-by certificate from Norwegian Maritime Directorate
Fifi: Fire firghting class notification LNG: Vessels with LNG and Marine Gas oil fuel possibilities ROV: Remote Operated Vehicle - applicable for CSV with ROV(s) installed SPS: Special Purpose Ship class notation A-Frame: Deployment equipment for AFITS

Special events and exit mechanisms
· Long term contract for pool vessels:
 When a vessel in a pool secures a new long term contracts, it does not exit the pool, but remains in the pool and generate pool earnings
· Vessels not included in pools:  Original Solstad vessels and Rem vessels with no comparable vessels in the other company, hence no issues between the two lenders groups
· When a vessel is offhire due to technical issues:
A vessel will be temporary suspended during time of performing planned periodic maintenance/DD or alike  The vessel will participate as normal in the pool during offhire as long as the Loss Of Hire (LOH) insurance is valid, typically ~90 days  Should the vessel still not be able to return to service after the LOH period, the vessel will temporary exit the pool until it again can return to service
· Exit from the pool arrangement
 In general the Bank/Vessel owner has the right to withdraw/exit a vessel from the pool arrangement by giving 6 months written notice to the pool manager
An excemption is if the vessel is under contract at the time of exit; if the contract cannot be transferred to another vessel in the Pool within the notice period, the Pool is to be compensated in full for the loss of future earnings by the Bank/Vessel owner that withdraws its vessel Note also that a Bank/Vessel owner that has withdrawn a vessel from the Pool cannot compete with the other vessels in the pool in any way
If a vessel owner is in default on its debt, the bank can demand to withdraw this vessel from the pool with one month written notice
 The Pool Management can at any time take a vessel out of the pool arrangement, by providing one months written notice
