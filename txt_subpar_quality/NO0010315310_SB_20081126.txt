Summons to Bondholders' Meetings

Oslo, 17 November 2008

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("Norsk Tillitsmann") is appointed as loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the above mentioned bond issues (the "Loan(s)") where Club Cruise Entertainment & Travelling Services Europe N.V. ( the "Borrower") is the borrower.

All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the agreement of the Loan (the "Loan Agreement(s)") or this summons to the Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise stated.

In a Notice to Bondholders published of 3 November 2008, the Loan Trustee informed the Bondholders that the Borrower would not be able to pay the interest payment due 8 November 2008 for the loan with ISIN NO 001 036383.1. The grace period has expired, and the Borrower is therefore in default related to this Loan, ref the Loan Agreement Clause 18.1 (a).

Accordingly, the Borrower is in cross default for the Loans with ISIN NO 001 030468.6 and ISIN NO 001 031531.0, ref the Loan Agreements Clauses 15.1 (c).

For further information related to the economic situation of the Borrower, we refer to the report for 3Q 2008 (attached, see Appendix 1).

Given the current situation of the Borrower, the Loan Trustee requests for authority from the Bondholders to default each Loan and start the recovery process, hereunder to enforce the security (by way of for instance a forced sale of the vessels), and/or to declare the Borrower bankrupt. The Loan Trustee will hire external assistance from lawyers and consultants in this respect.

The cost incurred by the Loan Trustee in connection with the process, will be deducted from the proceeds o f the Loans before disbursement to the Bondholders.

The individual bondholder may authorise the Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Norsk Tillitsmann to vote, must then be returned to Norsk Tillitsmann in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details).

In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Loan Trustee accepts as sufficient proof o f the ownership of the Bonds.
