Joint Administrators' Six Month Report
1. Introduction
1.1 Chad Griffin and Lisa Rickelton were appointed as Joint Administrators of the Companies on 6 January 2016.
1.2 This report is prepared pursuant to Rule 2.47 of the Insolvency Rules 1986 (as amended) ("the Rules") and Rule 2.38 of the Insolvency (Scotland) Rules 1986 ("the Scottish Rules") to report on the progress of the administration during the period since our appointment, from 6 January 2016 to 5 July 2016 ("the Period").
1.3 Statutory information pertaining to the Companies and as required by the Rules is set out in Appendix A. On 27 May 2016, Iona re registered as a private limited Company.
1.4 As insolvency practitioners we are bound by the Insolvency Code of Ethics. Prior to our appointment we considered potential ethical threats in undertaking the administration in accordance with the Code, and we did not consider that there were any matters preventing us taking this appointment.
1.5 Following a meeting of creditors on 17 June 2016, the Joint Administrators were also appointed as Joint Supervisors of the CVA in relation to Iona.
1.6 No creditors committee has been formed in the Administration and no creditors committee has been proposed for the CVA.
1.7 This report together with appendices also contains information in relation to the activities undertaken since our appointment. This includes receipts and payments into the insolvency estate (Appendix B) and the Administrators' time costs in accordance with Statement of Insolvency Practice 9 ("SIP9") (Appendices C and D).

Details of the rules in relation to Administrators remuneration together with details of our time costs to date are set out in Appendices C and D.
1.9 Time costs and disbursements incurred in the Period for Huntington amount to £93,114 (plus VAT). Of this amount £41,404 (plus VAT) has been billed.

1.18 I enclose further information in relation to creditors' rights to information at Appendix E.
2. Conduct of the Administration
Shares in lona/Orlando and Kells Licenses
2.1 As advised in our Proposals report, a marketing process had been conducted in respect of the Orlando and Kells licenses and interest had been focused on a sale of the shares in Iona, subject to, amongst other things, a restructuring of Iona achieved using a CVA mechanism.
2.2 As set out in our CVA proposals dated 1 June 2016, a sale to Bridge Petroleum 2 Limited (the Purchaser) has been agreed for the shares of a restructured Iona, including its interest in the Orlando and Kells licenses. The CVA which achieves the necessary restructuring was approved by 100% of creditors who voted in person or by proxy at the meeting on 17 June 2016.
2.3 The sale was anticipated to complete in late July. Target completion has now been extended until late August to allow Bridge a further period to finalise its funding arrangements. This extension is not anticipated to impact any of the dates in the CVA and neither will it result in any variations to the CVA. Although we anticipate completion in late August, there remains a risk that the sale does not complete. In such circumstances the CVA fund would not be available for creditors and the CVA would fail. In such a scenario we would notify creditors as soon as practicable.
2.4 As part of the CVA, the purchaser has agreed to provide a $2m fund which will be ring fenced for distribution to approved claims of CVA creditors. As part of the transaction, the Security Trustee has enforced on the shares in Iona, and these will be sold to the Purchaser, subject to Iona's Bond debt. The Purchaser will fund Iona to repay $5.7m of Iona's outstanding Bond debt prior to buying the remaining Bond debt. Deferred consideration will be payable by the Purchaser in respect of the purchase of the Bond debt. Deferred consideration is primarily calculated by reference to future revenue on the Orlando and Kells fields.
2.5 A full copy of the CVA Proposal can be found on https://www.thecreditorgateway.co.uk/ using password: ec63hy54dk. If creditors wish to be supplied with a hard copy, they should contact us using the details set out in Section 5 below.
2.6 The 28 day challenge period in relation to the CVA passed on 17 July 2016 and no objections were lodged at court.
2.7 The deadline for claims in the CVA is 5pm on 25 July 2016. If creditors have not yet submitted a claim, this should be submitted by this deadline in order to participate in the $2m fund.
Trent and Tyne License
2.8 As advised in the original Administrators' proposals a consensual settlement in relation to Iona's interest in the Trent and Tyne License was agreed with Perenco UK Limited (Perenco) and nil cash consideration passed.
West Wick
2.9 As reported previously, On 3 February 2016 we signed a sale of Iona's interest in the West Wick license for $1.76m to Chevron North Sea Limited. (`Chevron'). Transaction proceeds are deferred and contingent, linked to the approval of a FDP.
2.10 The transaction completed on 28 June 2016. Transaction proceeds will be assigned to the Security Trustee effective from completion of the sale of Iona.
Transactions relating to other licenses held by Iona
2.11 At the date of appointment Iona also held a working interest in three other exploration licenses; Ronan & Oran, Fleetwind and Farne & Lundy. All three licenses have now been relinquished.
Huntington licenses and other entitlements
2.12 As reported previously, in addition to the 15% interest in the Huntington field, Huntington also owns the following entitlements:

CRITICAL THINKING AT THE CRITICAL TIMETM

Joint Administrators' Six Month Report
1.2% royalty entitlement from Premier Oil UK Limited ("Premier"); 0.6% royalty entitlement from Noreco Denmark A/S ("Noreco"); and 0.75% disproportionate lifting entitlement ("DLE") with Eon. 2.13 As previously reported, we agreed a termination of the royalty entitlement with Premier for $0.9m, which was received on 25 January 2016. 2.14 No interest was received in the marketing process relation to Huntington's 15% license interest, and a default was persisting at the commencement of the administration. On 29 January 2016 we received notice from the joint operating partners stating that, pursuant to the default, they were exercising their rights to acquire Huntington's interest. Discussions are ongoing with Premier in relation to this process and efforts to realise value in the remaining Huntington entitlements continue.
Receipts and payments during the period - Iona
2.15 Details of the material receipts and payments during the period, and not covered above, are summarised below. 2.16 A receipts and payments account for Iona during the period covered by this report is provided at Appendix B.
Cash on appointment
2.17 Cash on appointment totaled £1.5m.
Prepayments recoveries
2.18 To date, the Administrators have realised £41k from cash held on account in respect of corporate credit card facilities that have been cancelled on our appointment and cash held on account by pre-appointment legal advisors. The Administrators anticipate some insurance prepaid recoveries as part of the consideration for the sale.
Joint venture income
2.19 During the administration, the Administrators have raised invoices to Iona's joint venture partners for their share of pre appointment cash expenditure on the corresponding licenses. To date the Administrators have recovered £11k from Atlantic Petroleum North Sea Limited ("Atlantic") in respect of the Kells license and £6k from Idemitsu Petroleum UK Limited in respect of the West Wick license.
2.20 The Administrators continue to liaise with Atlantic concerning Orlando joint venture billings.
Moveable assets and PPE
2.21 The Administrators have realised £22.5k in relation to Iona's moveable assets and PPE. Since the date of this report the Administrators have received a further £38.4k. No further realisations are anticipated during the administration period.
Contribution to professional fees
2.22 $250k was received from Bridge as a deposit in relation to the sale of Iona. The deposit has been transferred to the CVA bank account and therefore is not included in the Administrators receipts and payments in Appendix B.
Employees and project critical contractors
2.23 All employees and project critical contractors were retained during the initial stage of the administrations to support the M&A process. The Administrators appraised the staffing levels throughout the administration and by 29 February 2016 had reduced staffing levels to 5 core employees. The remaining employees will be made redundant on completion of the sale of Iona. Employee and contractor costs to date are £1.7m.
Legal fees and critical suppliers
2.24 Pre appointment legal expenses of £341k were paid from the Administration estate.

Joint Administrators' Six Month Report
2.25 Post appointment legal expenses of £479k have been paid in the Administration in relation to the Trent and Tyne transaction, West Wick sale and sale of Iona.
2.26 Pre appointment Administrator fees of £333k were paid from the Administration estate. 2.27 Post appointment Administrators fees of £148k have been paid to date. 2.28 Payments to critical suppliers have totaled £58k to date, principally comprising certain demurrage costs in respect of the
pre-appointment liquids liftings. Payment of the demurrage costs was necessary to ensure our entitlement to sell the associated liquids lifted.
Receipts and payments during the period - Huntington
2.29 A receipts and payments account for Huntington during the period covered by this report is provided at Appendix B. 2.30 Details of the material receipts (other than royalty termination as discussed above) and payments during the period are
summarised below.
Cash on appointment
2.31 Cash on appointment totaled £4.4m.
Book debts
2.32 Book debts relate to gas and oil sales from the Huntington field together with the royalty entitlements and the DLE. The book value of book debts totaled c.£1.9m. To date £853k of book debts have been recovered in the administration.
Taxation
2.33 We have notified HM Revenue and Customs of our appointment and appropriate filings have been made to support the Companies' corporation tax and VAT positions at the date of the administrations. Iona has received a VAT refund of £1.9m. In addition Huntington has received a VAT refund of £19k.
3. Investigations
Statutory investigations
3.1 We have undertaken our investigation work in accordance with SIP2 including a review of the books and records of the Companies in order to understand the realisable assets of the Companies and comparing these to the values in the directors' statement of affairs.
3.2 The data gathered from our investigations assisted with our statutory duties, pursuant to the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, to review the conduct of all directors who served in respect of the Companies in the 3 year period prior to the date of the Administrations. We have concluded our review and have submitted a final return to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.
3.3 Should any creditors have any further relevant information in relation to directors' conduct, they should provide details in writing to the Administrators.
4. Estimated Outcomes
Secured creditors
4.1 At the date of the appointments the Secured Creditors were owed $263m by the Companies. The Secured Creditors held a number of securities which were listed in the SIP 16 letter to creditors and included as Appendix G in the Administrators' proposals dated 9 February 2016.
4.2 The amount due to the secured creditors was net of $57m restricted cash which had been distributed to the Security Trustee prior to the date of appointment. Of this amount $50m was distributed by the Security Trustee to bondholders with the remaining $7m held as contingency.
4.3 No further funds have been distributed to the secured creditors from the Companies at this stage.

CRITICAL THINKING AT THE CRITICAL TIMETM

Joint Administrators' Six Month Report
4.4 As summarised above, it is anticipated that the Security Trustee will receive a further $5.7m debt repayment following the sale of Iona. Deferred consideration from the sale of the Bond debt will also be payable by the Purchaser.
4.5 Conditional upon the approval of the FDP, West Wick would result in realisations to the Security Trustee of $1.76m. 4.6 As set out in the CVA Proposal, potential recovery actions were also excluded from the sale of Iona. Further work is
required to ascertain the prospects of such actions. 4.7 The level of future net recoveries to the Security Trustee in relation to the Administration of Huntington are uncertain at
this stage.
Preferential creditors
4.8 We do not anticipate any preferential creditors in either Iona or Huntington.
Unsecured creditors
4.9 Unsecured creditors rank behind both secured and preferential creditors. 4.10 Under Section 176A of the Act where after 15 September 2003 the company has granted a creditor a floating charge, a
proportion of the net property of the company achieved from floating charge asset realisations must be made available for the unsecured creditors ("the Prescribed Part"). 4.11 There are unlikely to be sufficient funds to repay the Secured Creditors in full, therefore returns to unsecured creditors will come from the Prescribed Part only (Huntington) and CVA distribution (Iona). 4.12 The Prescribed Part applies where there are net floating charge realisations (i.e. after costs of realisation) available to unsecured creditors and is calculated as follows: · 50% of net property up to £10k · Plus 20% of net property in excess of £10k · Subject to a maximum of £600k 4.13 We currently expect the Prescribed Part in Huntington may reach the maximum of £600k. 4.14 The CVA expressly disapplies the obligation under s176A(2) of the Act for the Administrators to set aside the prescribed part. 4.15 Creditors have been asked to submit a claim in relation to the CVA of Iona. If any creditors have not yet submitted a claim then we should use the creditors' notice of claim form provided at Appendix I by 25 July 2016 with any claims made being supported by copy invoices or other relevant documentation sufficient to allow your claim to be adjudicated.
5. Next report and further questions
5.1 We are required to provide a progress report to all creditors within one month of the end of the next six months of the Administrations, or when the Administrations come to an end, whichever is sooner. It is anticipated that the administration of Iona will come to an end on the completion of the sale of Iona.

Administrators' fee estimate
A fee estimate of £665,048 for Iona and £238,098 for Huntington were included in the Administrators proposals. The time costs incurred to date are £989,615 in relation to the administration of Iona and £93,114 in relation to the administration of Huntington. Time costs for Iona have exceeded the estimate due the protracted timeframe and complexity of the transaction. As Administrators' Fee estimates are not a requirement in accordance with the Scottish Rules, further approval is not required in relation to the Iona fees that exceed the estimate provided in the proposals. We consider that the Huntington estimate remains appropriate. Details of the further work we propose to undertake is as follows Administration and planning · Formalities in respect of the Administration together with the planning, and execution of, an appropriate Administration exit
route. · Other Administrative duties including accounting for receipts and payments, completing checklists and reviews relating to
both the Administration and any subsequent liquidation, cashiering and reconciliations, and internal case management and maintenance. · Complying with statutory formalities including relevant filings and statutory communications. Realisations · Progressing to completion on the sale of Iona.
· Continuing to seek to realise value from Huntington's license interests. Investigations
· Ongoing review of potential recovery actions. Creditors · Continued communication with the Companies' creditors including employees, pension providers, key suppliers and landlords. Tax · Communications with relevant tax authorities including the filing of post appointment tax returns. Reporting · Preparing statutory communication with creditors including 6 month and 12 month Administration progress reports, and
where appropriate, statutory communications in any subsequent liquidation.
Administrators' expenses
We anticipate that the following expenses will be incurred for the remainder of the appointment. Please note that this is for information purposes only and are subject to change. All costs cover the period to closure of the administration and do not include costs we anticipate would be incurred during a CVA. Trading costs - Trading costs of £1.3m are expected to be incurred in the administration of Iona. Trading costs comprise employee costs (including salaries, pension contributions, management incentive payments and enhanced redundancies), office costs (principally rent and rates) and critical supplier payments (principally costs relating to the ongoing IT and telecommunications services). Legal costs - We have continued to use the services of CMS Cameron McKenna LLP and Akin Gump LLP during the administration to advise on relevant matters arising during the administration and in preparing the CVA and sale documentation. We expect further costs to be split £885k to Iona and £60k Huntington. We note that this estimate excludes any further costs associated with the CVA. Agent's fees and expenses - Agent fees and selling costs of £10k have been incurred but not yet paid, in relation to selling the assets of Iona.

Appendix E - Additional Information in relation to Administrators' fees pursuant to SIP9
Detailed below is FTI's policy in relation to: · staff allocation and the use of sub-contractors; · professional advisors; and · disbursements.
Staff allocation and the use of subcontractors
Our general approach to resourcing our assignments is to allocate staff with the skills and experience to meet the specific requirements of the case. The constitution of the case team will usually consist of a Senior Managing Director, Managing Director, Director, Senior Consultant and Consultant. The exact constitution of the case team will depend on the anticipated size and complexity of the assignment. With regard to support staff, we would advise that time spent by cashiers in relation to specific tasks on an assignment is charged. Only if there is a large block of time incurred by a member of the secretarial team, e.g., report compilation and distribution, do we seek to charge and recover our time in this regard.
Professional advisors
On this assignment we have used the professional advisors listed below. We have also indicated alongside, the basis of our fee arrangement with them, which is subject to review on a regular basis.

Name of professional advisor
CMS Cameron McKenna LLP (legal advice) Akin Gump LLP (legal advice - bondholder & administrators) HBJ Gateley (Huntington license matters) Thommessen (Norwegian lawyers) Appleby (Cayman law advice) Insolvency Support Services Limited RSM (payroll services) Sweeney Kincaid (asset realisations)

Fees paid to date (£)

4,877 32,016
nil nil 1,260 nil

Our choice was based on our view of their experience and ability to perform this type of work, the complexity and nature of the assignment and the basis of our fee arrangement with them.
We have utilized the services of other teams within FTI Consulting LLP to assist with the Administration processes. The fees of our tax, technology and strategic communication teams have been included in our SIP9 analysis provided to creditors of the Companies and allocated to the work streams and entities to which their work related.
We consider that the rates chargeable for these services are in line with general market practice and that the service is comparable to similar firms of professional advisors. In addition, by working closely with our internal teams, we believe a more coordinated and cost-effective approach to the Administration work streams has been possible.
Disbursements
Category 1 disbursements do not require approval by creditors. The type of disbursements that may be charged as a Category 1 disbursement to a case generally comprise of external supplies of incidental services specifically identifiable to the case, such as

Category 2 disbursements do require approval from creditors. These disbursements can include costs incurred which relate to payments due to associated companies for the provision of services to the office holder.
On this assignment we have incurred category 2 disbursements in the following classes. We have also indicated alongside, the basis of calculation of these costs.

Creditors registered for VAT may be able to claim VAT bad debt relief in accordance with Section 36 Value Added Tax Act 1994. In broad terms relief is available when the debt is six months old and "written off" by the creditor entering it on his VAT refunds-for-bad-debts-account.
Claims lodged in the Administration should be gross, including any VAT element. If/when dividends are paid, creditors who have claimed VAT bad debt relief must apportion the dividend between VAT and the net element of their claim and account to HM Customs and Excise for the VAT element through their VAT return.
Insolvency Practitioners have no role in administering VAT bad debt relief under the Value Added Tax Act 1994. Creditors who are uncertain how to claim should contact their VAT office or take professional advice.
