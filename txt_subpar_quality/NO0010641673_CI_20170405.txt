IMS update - refinancing of the 2017 financial debt maturities
I.M. Skaugen SE has, as previously announced, entered discussions with relevant parties regarding the refinancing of all the 2017 financial debt maturities. Particularly on 1 March 2017, bondholders' meetings in IMSK12 and IMSK13 approved a short deferral of the maturity of these two bonds until 6 April 2017 to provide necessary time to finalize the refinancing solution. The discussions with the relevant parties are progressing in a constructive manner, and we expect final agreement to be within reach. We therefore intend to send out a Summons for new bondholders' meetings on or about 6 April. Consequently, settlement of the bonds will not take place on 6 April 2017.
