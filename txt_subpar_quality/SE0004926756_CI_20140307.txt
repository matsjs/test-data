2013 in review
2013 developments
 2013 was furthermore characterized by difficult market conditions in Finland and Russia, which combined with negative exchange rate movements led to a 6% sales decline
 Positive developments in Sweden and the USA during H2 2013 partly mitigated the decline in other markets and give us confidence regarding the sales outlook for 2014
 Focus during 2013 was on the integration between Kahrs and Karelia-Upofloor, which was completed in line with plan
-- Majority of synergies expected in 2014
 The factory in Kuopio, Finland, was closed during October 2013, while production in Tuupovaara was scaled back to a few selected design products
-- All activities in relation to the factory footprint changes were completed in line with plan
-- Volumes from Kuopio and Tuupovaara were moved to the remaining factories in Sweden and Russia
-- Cost savings from the factory footprint changes were furthermore confirmed during Q4 2013

Considerations for proposed SEK 225m tap issuance

Kahrs Group

 The Kahrs management team and owners are seeking a SEK 225m bond tap issuance during Q1 2014, in addition, we propose to subsequently use excess cash of SEK 350m for a shareholder distribution
- Proceeds from the tap issuance and excess cash currently on the balance sheet would be used to fully repay the remaining SEK 260m shareholder loans to Triton and Hartwall, while allowing for a smaller dividend distribution of SEK 90 to the shareholders. Total distributable funds to the owners would thus be SEK 350m
 Goal is to create a more efficient capital structure for Kahrs going forward
-- The refinancing would lead to a more efficient capital structure for Kahrs vs. the situation today where Kahrs has significant excess cash on the balance sheet. Post-refinancing adj. net debt of Kahrs would be 2.9x 2013A EBITDA and 2.3x 2014E EBITDA
-- Post-refinancing, assuming the tap is issued at 107, the group would have SEK 99m of cash on the balance sheet, thus pre funding a significant portion of the planned capex in 2014
-- We are in parallel discussions to secure a working capital facility of maximum SEK 100m to handle annual NWC swings. Options are currently being evaluated with relevant banks. Potential impact on net leverage of 0.2x LTM EBITDA at an average utilization of 50%

Timing for bondholders' meeting

Kahrs Group

 The resolution requires a qualified majority of two thirds (2/3) of the bonds represented
 Timeline for the Vote:
 Friday 7th March - Voting request distributed to bond holders by post and made public through a press release
 Wednesday 26th March - Deadline for replies from bondholders
 Only holders registered as such on Wednesday 19th March (Record Date) are entitled to vote

Income statement, cash flows and key metrics

Kahrs Group

Comments  2013 EBITDA in line with expectation despite softer sales development due to strong cost control by management
 Operating cash flow is expected to continue improving, mainly due to improved profitability and realisation of synergies from Karelia merger
-- 2013 cash flows were negatively impacted by one time investment and restructuring costs related to the combination - underlying cash flows remain strong
 Extraordinary items in 2013, in total SEK 72 million, relate to the Karelia merger
-- All restructuring costs are accounted for in 2013
 Solid deleveraging profile expected, even after a SEK 225m bond tap issuance
-- Pro forma adj. net debt is expected to decline from 2.9x EBITDA in 2013 to 2.0x in 2014
-- Pro forma interest cover is expected to increase to 4.4x in 2014
Note: All numbers are pro forma for the SEK 225m bond tap issuance Total net debt Senior unsecured bonds + financial leases - cash Adj. net debt is defined as Senior unsecured bonds - cash; Adj. Net Debt (excl. Financial leases) is compared against a pro forma EBITDA for 2013 of SEK 218m, which is the Normalised 2013 EBITDA of SEK 227m reduced by the lease related expenses of SEK 9.5m
