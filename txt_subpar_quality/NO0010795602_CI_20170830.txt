Comments
S LTM Revenue and EBTIDA, more or less in line with expectations
S Prices has been good in 1H 2017. A bit more challenging market environment expected for 2H 2017, but NA have good progress in the market with our new concept.
S LTM Harvest per Q showing the expected trend,
S LTM harvest in line and targeting the 28/30 K Ton WFE going forward
S NRI, some negative effect on harvest cost and volume. This is related to investment in Sixty South concept in the market and lower growth and delayed stocking in 2017. Higher feed conversion rate (eFCR) than expected due to some feed quality issues (will adjust feed strategy going forward)

3) Revenue & Ebit/Kg per Q
Comments
 Operational revenue in line with expected per Q, difference a mix of volumes and EBIT/Kg
 Trend on EBIT/Kg WFE showing as expected better performance since Q2-16
 EBIT/Kg WFE, showing an impressive figure in Q2-17, best in history of the company
S Expected EBIT/kg for average 2017 will be around USD 3
Expected sales price and margin in 2H 2017 to be reduced. Sales volume will be slightly lower than target in 2017 due to the feed/eFCR issues (27' MT vs 28' MT)
Impact of the margin development for NA expected to be better than industry average in Chile due to the Sixty South and ASC/non antibiotic penetration in the market.
