VIKING REDNINGSTJENESTE TOPCO AS
BOARD OF DIRECTORS' REPORT 2017
THE GROUP'S BUSINESS AND LOCATION
Viking Redningstjeneste TopCo AS was established in 2012 and is the parent Company of Viking Assistance Group AS. Viking Assistance Group was established on 14 September 2015 and owns 100 percent of the shares in Viking Redningstjeneste AS, Viking Sverige AB, Viking Assistance A/S, Viking Assistance Oy and Viking Nordic Assistance S.L.. The subGroup Viking Redningstjeneste AS includes Viking Redningstjeneste Detalj AS and Sæter Bilberging AS, the subgroup Viking Sverige AB includes Stor-Stockholm Bärgningstjänst AB, Viking Redningstjänst AB and Vägassistans i Göteborg AB and the subgroup Viking Assistance A/S includes Viking København A/S.
Viking Redningstjeneste TopCo AS is located at Lysaker in Bærum outside Oslo, Norway.
Of the companies in the Group, there are currently no active daily operations in Sæter Bilberging AS.
The Viking Group provides roadside assistance in Norway, Sweden and Denmark and has nationwide presence throughout Scandinavia via its subsidiaries and franchise network. In addition to providing roadside assistance, Group management services, IT operations- and development, and centralized purchasing services, the Viking Group provides services in medical assistance, handles service calls and emergency calls on behalf of various partners through call centers in Bærum in Norway, Copenhagen in Denmark, and through offices in Torrevieja in Spain.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Viking Redningstjeneste TopCo's profit before income tax amount to KNOK -13 722 (2016: KNOK 7 341). The Viking Group had operating result of KNOK 23 564 (2016: KNOK 34 802) and a loss before tax of KNOK 58 969 (2016: loss before tax of KNOK 37 961).
The Board notes that the Company's financial development during 2017 were affected by growth in the Group's revenues, mainly due to solid operations and volumes in the Norwegian market, as well as increased revenue and activity in Denmark and particularly in Sweden. Throughout the year, the Viking Group has had satisfactory liquidity and cash flow, however increased costs have incurred partly due to the reorganization of the operations in Sweden, and the establishment of the wholly owned and operated call center subsidiary in Torrevieja in Spain. The difference between operating profit and cash flow from operations is largely an effect of depreciations, interest and borrowing costs, as well as currency losses on the bond loan in SEK and change in working capital.
The investments in the Group will facilitate development of Viking's information system, which is the computer system VIS, investments in brand name and trademarks, investments in vehicles for Viking Redningstjeneste Detalj AS, StorStockholm Bärgningstjänst AB, Viking Rädningstjänst AB, Vägassistans i Gøteborg, Viking Assistance A/S and Viking København A/S.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS There has been no material subsequent events.
THE ENTITY'S OUTLOOK
Future business prospects are uncertain. External factors that may affect Viking's future situation are amongst others insurance companies' terms and conditions, car importers' assistance schemes, the Scandinavian economy in general and weather conditions. The board is of the opinion that Viking's market position forms a good basis for further development.
FINANCIAL RISK
The Viking Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on the interest bearing long-term debt. The exposure is reduced through fixed rate loan and interest rate swap. The Group is moderately exposed to changes in exchange rate fluctuations as majority of loans and the revenues of the Group's largest operating companies are in Norwegian Krone. A callable fixed rate bond of MSEK 207 was issued in April and the part of the Group's revenues originating from currencies other than Norwegian Krone was 35 % in 2017, wherby SEK accounted for 20 %. Customer credit risk is considered low as the larger part of the customer base is considered very solid.
The Group's financial position is considered satisfactory. The Viking Groups cash and bank deposits as of 31 December 2017 were KNOK 29 445. The Company considers the liquidity to be satisfactory and management work continously with measures to reduce and manage liquidity risk.
GOING CONCERN ASSUMPTION The board confirms that the going concern assumption present and realistic. The Company refinanced debt during 2017 and is now financed with equity, bank loan and two listed callable bonds maturing in April and July 2021. Furthermore, the conditions for continued operation based on expectations relating to earnings and cash flow in the subsidiar Viking Group.
ALLOCATION OF PROFIT AND BASIS FOR DIVIDEND The Board of Directors of Viking Redningstjeneste Topco has proposed that no dividends shall be paid for the financial year 2017. The board suggests that the net profit for the year of KNOK -10 534 is covered from other equity.
WORKING ENVIRONMENT
The board and the General Manager consider the working environment to be good. There were no
employees in the holding company in 2017.

ABSENCE Sick leave in the Group is satisfactory at less than 1,5 % in total in 2017 (2016: 2,5 %)
INJURIES As in 2016, no accidents leading to personal injuries or material damage were reported in the group during 2017.
Gender equality Equal treatment is enshrined in the Groups employee handbook that everyone is entitled to equal treatment and the Viking Group strives to create favourable conditions for all employees regardless of gender, so that both men (53%) and women (47%) have equal opportunity to develop their abilities.
DISCRIMINATION The Norwegian Anti-Discrimination Act is designed to promote equality, ensure equal opportunities and rights and prevent discrimination based on ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, colour, language, religion or belief. The Group works actively, purposefully and methodically to promote the purpose of the Act within our business. Work in this area includes recruitment, wages and working conditions, promotion, development and protection against harassment.
The Viking Group and all subsidiaries aim to be a workplace where there is no discrimination on grounds of disability.

Notes to the consolidated financial statement
Note 1 - Accounting principles
1.1 General information
The Viking Group has offices in Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen. Their main office is located in Bærum, Oslo. The Group serves their customers through an extensive nationwide network of fully-owned stations and franchise stations in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Their main operation is providing roadside assistance. As part of the roadside assistance in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, the Viking Group operates call centers in Alicante and Malaga in Spain.
1.2 Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
1.3 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union in compliance with financial years ending 31 December 2017.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by derivatives at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in section 1.22.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption of a going concern.

1.4 Consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. Control of an entity occurs when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the day on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Business combinations
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred from the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total consideration transferred, the non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the Group's accounting principles.
1.5 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision makers. The chief operating decision makers, who is responsible for the allocation of resources and the assessment of performance of the operating segments, is defined as the Board of Directors that makes strategic decisions. Furter information regarding segments is given in note 2.
1.6 Foreign currency translation
a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of the individual entities within the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the "functional currency"). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Norwegian Kroner (NOK).
b) Transactions and balance sheet items
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, and are presented as other financial income or other financial expenses.

c) Group companies
The results and balances of all of the Group entities that have functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
a) Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; b) Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rate; and c) All resulting exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
However, the Group has adopted the exemption not to apply IAS 21 The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates retrospectively to fair value adjustments and goodwill arising in business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to IFRS, in accordance with IFRS 1.
1.7 Operating revenues
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represent amounts receivable for services supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes. Revenues are recognised when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity; and when specific criteria have been met for the Group's activities, as described below:
The Group companies provides roadside assistance, and revenues from services are recognised when road assistance has been provided. Group companies also have prepaid assistance agreements towards different customer groups, and for these agreements the share of revenues associated with future services are recognised in the balance sheet as prepaid assistance at the time of sale and subsequently recognised proportionally with the work perfomed (linear accumulation).
Also, Group companies have revenues from sales of good, such as automobile batteries, tyres, flushing medium, windshield wipers and similar. Revenue from sales of goods are recognised when the significant risk and reward of the ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer.

1.8 Fixed assets
Fixed assets consist of transportation vehicles, machinery and equipment, and financially leased vehicles (see section 1.18). Fixed assets are measured at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical costs includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within Other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to the residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Transportation vehicles: 5-10 years Machinery and equipment: 3-5 years Financial leasing: 5 years
The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each annual reporting period.
An asset's carrying amount is written down when appropriate according to the impairement rules (see 1.10) to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
1.9 Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised. Goodwill and trademark are calculated as the sum of the consideration and the book value of non-controlling interest and the fair value of previously owned shares, minus net value of identifiable assets and liabilities at acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortised but are tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually at year-end or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of the relevant unit including goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment of goodwill is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill that was recognised prior to the IFRS conversion date 1 January 2015 was allocated to the respective CGUs using the presentation currency (NOK). This goodwill is subsequently measured and tested for impairment based on this currency.
Other intangible assets
a) Trademark
Trademark is capitalised and has an indefinite useful life. It is tested for impairment annually, either individually or as part of a cash-generating unit. Trademark is not amortised. Management reviews annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life assumption is valid.

b) Franchise network
In the Viking Group, franchise rights are described as the right a franchisee has to operate under the Viking's trademark. In time, this will contribute to strengthen the brand name by visibility. As long as the franchise network in the different segments are not fully expanded, upfront fee for franchise networks are capitalized. As soon as the franchise network is considered fully developed in the different segments, it is considered to have a finite useful life and is therefore carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method. The expected useful life for franchise network is 10 years. As of 31st of december 2016, franchise network in all segments is fully expanded.
c) Customer contracts
Customer contracts as intangible assets consist of two elements; (1) calculated value of current contracts, and (2) calculated value of renewal of the contracts. As the useful life of intangible assets that occurs as a result of contractual relationships, cannot exceed the period of the contractual rights when it is the customer that is entitled to renew the contract, the Viking Group has estimated the useful life of the customer contracts. The expected useful life for customer contracts is 15 years, and they are amortized using the straight-line method.
1.10 Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing an impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (CGU's). Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill and trademark) are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.
1.11 Financial assets
Classification
Financial assets are classified in the following categories: (1) at fair value through profit or loss, and (2) loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial asset was acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. The group has no financial assets classified at fair value through profit or loss.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities over 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group's loans and receivables comprise accounts receivables, other current receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairments.

Impairment offinancial assets
The Group assesses, at each balance sheet date, whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a "loss event") and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset, or group of financial assets, that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors, or a group of debtors, is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
For loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor's credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
1.12 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of trade goods comprises direct costs, import duty and freight. It excludes borrowing costs and also warehouse/storage costs which are classified as other operating expense. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. Inventories in the Viking Group consist mainly of car batteries held for resale.
1.13 Accounts receivable
Accounts receivables are amounts due from customers with credit for sold goods and services in the ordinary course of the business. If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
1.14 Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three-months or less and bank overdrafts.
The statement of cash flows has been prepared according to the indirect method. Interest payments are classified as cash flow from operational activities.
1.15 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

1.16 Income tax
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries where the company's subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is calculated at relevant tax rates on the basis of the temporary differences which exist between accounting and tax values, and any carryforward losses for tax purposes at the year-end. Tax enhancing or tax reducing temporary differences, which are reversed or may be reversed in the same period, have been eliminated. The disclosure of deferred tax benefits on net tax reducing differences which have not been eliminated, and carryforward losses, is based on estimated future earnings. Deferred tax and tax benefits which may be shown in the balance sheet are presented net.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
1.17 Trade and other payable
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial year which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting period. They are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For payables due within 12 months, the payables are not discounted and are measured at the nominal amount.
1.18 Leasing
The Viking Group leases land and buildings, as well as vehicles, and assesses the classification of each element as a financial or an operating lease separately, based on the distribution of risk and potential reward between the lessee and the lessor.
Financial leases:
Leasing of vehicles used in the business are classified as financial leasing, as substantially all the risk and reward of the ownership is allocated to the Viking Group. Financial lease are capitalised at the lease's commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Financial lease payments are allocated between liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in long term liabilities and current liabilities. The vehicles acquired under financial leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.

Operating lease agreements:
Leases in which more than an insignificant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operational leases. Payments made under operational lease (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Leasing of land and buildings, as well as leasing of corporate cars (three years maturity), are classified as operational leasing.
1.19 Bank borrowings
Bank borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised costs; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
1.20 Employee benefits
Pension obligations:
Group companies operate various pension schemes. The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
a) Defined contribution plans
For defined contribution plans, the group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments are available.
b) Defined benefit plans
Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factor such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past-service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the income statement.

c) Share based payments
The fair value of warrants granted under the Viking Redningstjeneste Topco's Employee Option Plan is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the warrant granted. The fair value of the warrant is calculated based on a Black-Scholes model, given certain conditions. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period. For further information about the Group's warrants, see note 3 Personnel expenses, pensions and remunerations.
1.21 Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation and it is probable that an outflow of resources is required to settle the obligation. The amount recognised is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the obligation, taking into account the risk and uncertainties surrounding the obligation, known at the end of the reporting period. Provisions are measured at present value, unless the time value is assessed to be immaterial.
1.22 Important accounting estimates and assumptions/prerequisites
The Group prepares estimates and makes assumptions/conditions related to the future by definition, the accounting estimates as follows from this will rarely be fully consistent with the final outcome. Estimates and assumptions/conditions that represent a significant risk of material changes in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Estimated impairment of goodwill
The Group conducts annual tests to assess impairment on goodwill (see note 7 Intangible Assets). The recoverable amount from CGU's is determined from calculations of the value in use value. These are calculations that require the use of estimates.
1.23 Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not applied as of 31 Dec 2017 and have not been adopted early in the Group
IFRS 9 Financial instruments
IFRS 9, 'Financial instruments', addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit and loss. The basis of classification depends on the entity's business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income not recycling. There is now a new expected credit loss model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the 'hedged ratio' to be the same as the one management actually use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39.
The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. For the Viking Group, there will be limited impact of the implementation of IFRS 9.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customer
The standard, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Viking Group is in the process of evaluating different revenue strams in order to determine eventual effects of IFRS 15. However, the adoption of IFRS 15 will have limited effect on the Group.
IFRS 16 Leases
In January 2016, IASB issued a new lease standard that will replace IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations IFRIC 4, SIC-15 and SIC-27. The standard requires assets and liabilities arising from all leases, with some exceptions, to be recognized on the balance sheet. This model reflects that, at the start of a lease, the lessee obtains the right to use an asset for a period of time and has an obligation to pay for that right. The accounting for lessors will be based on the same classification as under IAS17, operating or finance leasing. The definition of a lease is amended.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Viking Group has not yet adopted the new standard of IFRS 16. However, there will be some minor effects of the adoption of IFRS 16, as the Viking Group has operational leases regarding both buildings and corporate cars. For further information on operational leases, se note 15 Leasing.

Note 2 - Segment information

Pensions

Viking Group companies have both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. For defined contribution plans the cost is equal to the the Group's contribution to the employee's pension savings during the period. For defined benefit plans the cost is calculated based on actuarial valuation methods, taking assumptions related to employee's salary, turnover, mortality, discount rate etc. into consideration. Additionally, some companies in the Group have an agreed early retirement scheme (AFP).

Employees in the Group's Swedish and Danish entities are covered by pension plans that are classified as contribution plans. Employees in the Group's Norwegian entities are covered by pension plans that are classified as contribution plans and benefit plans. The defined benefit plan for the employees in Norway cover a total of 17 (18 in 2016) employees, of which 5 (6 in 2016) are retired. The rest of the employees in the Groups Norwegian entities are covered by contribution plans. The pension plans meet the requirements of the mandatory occupational pension scheme in each country.

a) Defined contribution plans

Defined contributions plans comprise arrangements whereby the company makes annual contributions to the employee's pension plan, and where the employee's future pension is determined by the amount of the contribution and the return on the pension plan asset. Contribution plans also comprise pension plans that are common to several companies, and the pension premium is determined independently by the demographic profile in the individual companies.

b) Defined benefit plans

Defined benefit plans give right to defined future benefits. These are mainly dependent on the number of qualifying employment years, salary at pension age, and the amount of benefits from the National Insurance Scheme. The

* In 2017, KNOK 282 of Trademark was reclassified to Franchise network for the Group's operations in Denmark as the Trademark/Network was considered to be fully expanded and finalized in Denmark at this stage. Accordingly, Viking Group started to amortize the Franchise network in accordance with the Group's policy (amortized over 10 years). As for 2016, KNOK 9 570 of Trademark was reclassified to Franchise network for the Group's operations in Sweden.

Trademark: The Viking Gruop considers the trademark to be of indefinite useful life, as a brand name does not systematically decrease in value over time. Annually, trademark is tested for impairment. It is also reviewed annually, to determine if the indefinite useful life assumtion is valid.
Franchise network: Franchise network consists of capitalised costs regarding the expantion of the franchise network in the different segments. As the network is considered fully expanded in the different segments, the Viking Group estimates the useful life to 10 years. Hence, franchise network is amortised using the straight-line method.

Customer contracts: Customer contracts as intangible assets consists of two elements; (1) calculated value of current contracts and (2) calculated value of renewal of the contracts. The expected useful life for customer contracts is 15 years, and they are amortized using the straight-line method.

Goodwill: Total goodwill consists of company goodwill and group goodwill that is related to the acquisition of Viking Redningstjeneste AS in 2009, Stor Stockholm Bärgningstjänst AB in 2010 and Viking København A/S in 2014, and the ICG transaction in 2013. All goodwill is allocated to those cash generating units that are expected to obtain added value due to synergies from the acquisitions. Goodwill has indefinite usefull life, and is annually tested for impairment (per CGU).

Impairment tests for goodwill and other intangible assets: Goodwill and other intangible assets are monitored by managment at the level of three cash generating units, defined similar as segments in note 2. A segment-level summary of the goodwill- and other intangible asset allocation is presented below:

Cash generating units (CGU)
The operations in Norway, Sweden and Denmark are considered to be the different groups of CGU's against which goodwill and other intangible assets are tested. Goodwill and other intangible assets are tested at the level monitored by group management at country by country basis. The recoverable amount from the group of CGU is calculated by looking at the historical figures for the group of CGU, taken into account expected growth in the Norwegian, Swedish and Danish markets.
When testing goodwill and other intangible assets, management has used a 5-year discounted cash flow with a growth rate of 1 % in terminal value for Norway, 1 % in the terminal value for Sweden and 1 % in the terminal value for Denmark. Estimated future EBITDA (operating profit before amortisation and impairment) is based on business plans approved by the Board. Impairment tests assume continuing operation of the gorups of CGU. The recoverable amount of the groups of CGU is calculated based on a "value in use" method. Present value of estimated future cash flows for each group of CGU is calculated using a discount rate after tax. This is based on a risk-free rate as stipulated below, plus a risk premium.

Assumptions used to calculate the value in use at 31.12.2017:
Goodwill and other intangible assets Impairment
Discount rate after tax
Effect on impairment given 1% increase in the discount rate

This years interest expense for the above long-term loans are specified in note 5 - Financial Income and Financial Expenses.

The Group refinancied their debt in april 2017. The new debt was raised by the parent company Viking Redningstjeneste TopCo AS, and consisted of two loans of respectively MNOK 500 and MSEK 207. As a result of the refinancing, the debt to DNB, the shareholder loan and the mezzanine debt to IGC were reedemed. Furthermore, Viking Assistance Group AS established a revolving facility of up to MNOK 50 and a guarantee facility of MNOK 10 through DNB for general corporate and working capital purposes for the Group. The revolving facility has been fully drawn on as of 31.12.17.

Security:
As security for the bond loans and the revolving facility in 2017, the borrower has pledged security in the groups assets. For the bond loans the borrower has pledged security in all shares and loans towards subsidiaries. For the revolving facility in DNB the borrower has pledged security in accounts receivables, fixed assets, shares in group companies and intercompany receivable and liabilities.

Covenants:
The loan agreements towards DNB contain the following requirements (covenants); (1) Total Net RCF Leverage in respect of any Relevant Period does not exceed 0.5:1. (2) The Issuer shall procure that during each calendar year there shall be a period of five (5) consecutive days during which the amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit and Guarantee Facilities, less cash and cash equivalents of the Group, amounts to zero or less. Not less than three (3) months shall elapse between two (2) such periods.
The loan agreements for the bond loans make reference to the second covenant listed above, and accordingly the second covenant also applies to the bond loans (both the loan in NOK and SEK). As of 31.12.17 all covenant requirements are met.
The loan agreement towards both DNB and ICG until the loans were reedemed in 2017 contained requirements (covenants) related to the following financial key ratios: Net debt in relation to EBITDA and interest cover less EBITDA in relation to gross financing costs. In addition, the size of annual capital expenditure is limited by covenants in the loan agreement. As of 31.12.16 all covenant requirements were met.

The following table shows the undiscounted payment profile of the Group's debt, based on the remaining loan period at the balance sheet date.

a) Market risk
Market risk can be defined as the risk that the Group's income and expenses, future cash flows or fair value of financial instruments will vary as a result of changes in market prices. The market price includes two types of risks: currency risks and interest risks.
Market risk is monitored continuously by the Group through a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives.
a-i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For risk management purposes, the Group has identified two types of currency exposures; (1) Exposure to loans in foreign currency and (2) Exposure to the presentation currency. Purchase of goods and services are mainly done in local currency, and as for loans and receivables between group companies, all are handled in the Group's presentation currency (NOK).
Exposure to loans in foreign currency
The group is exposed to changes in the exchange rate on the loans taken up by the subsidiaries in other currency than their own. As of 31.12.2017, Viking Redningtjeneste Topco AS holds a loan in SEK. See note 14 - Interest-bearing Liabilities for further information about the loan.
Exposure to the presentation currency
As an international group, Viking is exposed to the risk associated with converting the currency related to legal entities with a functional currency different from the Group's presentation currency. Such translation exposure does not yield an immediate result on the cash flow. It can still affect the Group's financial covenant and is therefore closely monitored. Exposure of foreign subsidiaries' equity is partly secured through borrowings in corresponding currency.
a-ii) Interest rate risk
The Group's interest rate risk is mainly related to loans where an element of interest rate is not fixed. As of 31st December 2017, the Group has two bond loans with nominal values of MNOK 500 and MSEK 207 respectivly, where the latter is carried at fixed rate. Furthermore, Viking Assistance Group AS established a revolving facility at floating rate in 2017 of up to MNOK 50, where MNOK 50 is drawn down at year end. As of 31st December 2016, the Group had a loan in DNB of MNOK 278 in nominal value, a mezzanine loan at floating rate, and a loan to shareholders at fixed rate. These loans were reedemed during 2017. In order to reduce the interest rate risk, Viking Assistance Group has an interest rate swap that covers MNOK 160 in 2017 (MNOK 200 in 2016). See note 14 - Interest-bearing liabilities and note 17 - Interest rate swap for further detailes regarding the loans.

Sensitivity analysis The analysis below presents the sensitivity of profit before tax and equity at year end to selected changes in market rates. Given an increase in the interes rate at year end, the market value of the interest rate swap would change. For a change in the interes rate curve for 2017, all instruments subject to floating interes rates would affect the result. The table below summarises the impact of an increase/decrease in interest rate for the given scenarios. All other variables are held constant, and the calculations is based on year end balances.

Change in year end interest rate (+ 1,0 %) Change in year end interest rate (- 0,5 %) Change in interest rate curve (+ 1,0 %) Change in interest rate curve (- 0,5 %)

Profit before tax
1 600 (800) (3 530) 1 765

Equity
1 216 (608) (2 683) 1 342

b) Credit risk
Credit risk is managed at the Group level. The Group is exposed to counterparty risk when group companies enter into salvage agreements. Credit risk also occurs from outstanding receivables. The Groups' customers base includes insurance companies, car manufacturers and transport industry companies, as well as the public sector. The Group has several frame agreements, long-term contracts and case by case customers for its products and services. Credit risk towards large customers with frame agreements and long-term contracts are considered to be limited as this Group is considered to be solid. Further, credit risk towards private customers and customers without agreements are considerd to be higher. Viking engaged Lindorff for mainly private customers in Norway in 2016 and 2017, to reduce the risk towards this group of customers. Going forward, the Group has an ambition to engage Lindorff for all customers.
c) Liquidity risk
The Group's liquidity risk is characterised by a potential risk of not being able to meet obligations to vendors and loan creditors. The ability to service the debt depends on the Group's cash flow from operating activities. The Group regularly monitors cash flow situation by setting up cash flow forecasts based on the forecasts of the liquidity reserves, including cash equivalents and borrowing facilities. The forecasts are set by the individual subsidiaries and is regularly monitored by the group.
To be able to maintain a sufficient flexibility in the source of funding, the Group has borrowing facilities of MNOK 50 in 2017 (MNOK 25 in 2016) which has been drawed down with MNOK 50 in 2017 (MNOK 10 in 2016), as well as that the Group keeps cash and cash equivalents of MNOK 29 in 2017 (MNOK 34 in 2016). In 2017, the Group has also established a guarantee facility of MNOK 10 through DNB for general corporate and working capital purposes.
See also note 14 Interest-bearing liability information on funding sources and payment profile.
Capital management
The Group's main goal is to maximize shareholder value while ensuring the Group's ability to continue operations, as well as to make sure that covenant criteria are met (see note 14 Interest-bearing liability re. financial covenant requirements). The Group has a target to maintain a capital structure that gives the Group an optimal capital binding given the current market situation. The Group makes the necessary changes to their capital structure based on an ongoing assessment of the business' financial situation and future prospects in the short and medium term.

Note 17 - Interest rate swap

All amounts in NOK thousand

Notes to the consolidated financial statem ent
Note 1 - Accounting principles
The annual accounts have been prepared in compliance with the Accounting Act and accounting principles generally accepted in Norway for periods ended 31 december 2017.
1.1 Classification of balance sheet items
Assets intended for long term ownership or use have been classified as fixed assets. Assets relating to the trading cycle have been classified as current assets. Other receivables are classified as current assets if they are to be repaid within one year after the transaction date. Similar criteria apply to liabilities.
Current assets are recognised at the lower of purchase cost and fair value. Current liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet at nominal amount.
Fixed assets are recognised at purchase cost and depreciated over the asset's expected useful life on a straight-line basis. Fixed assets are written down to fair value if a reduction in value is not expected to be temporary.
Nominal amounts are discounted if the interest element is material.
1.2 Investment in subsidiaries
The cost method is applied to investments in subsidiaries. The investments are recognised at cost unless a write-down has been necessary. The cost price is increased when group contributions are made to subsidiaries.
Dividends received are initially taken to income. Dividends exceeding the portion of retained equity after the purchase are reflected as a reduction in purchase cost. Dividend/group contribution from subsidiaries are reflected in the same year as the subsidiary makes a provision for the amount. Dividend from other companies are reflected as financial income when it has been approved.
1.3 Receivables
Accounts receivables are recognised in the balance sheet after provision for bad debts. The bad debts provision is made on basis of an individual assessment of each debtor and an additional provision is made for other debtors to cover expected losses.
1.4 Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
1.5 Taxes
The tax charge in the income statement includes both payable taxes for the period and changes in deferred tax. Deferred tax is calculated at relevant tax rates on the basis of the temporary differences which exist between accounting and tax values, and any carryforward losses for tax purposes at the year-end. Tax enhancing or tax reducing temporary differences, which are reversed or may be reversed in the same period, have been eliminated. The disclosure of deferred tax benefits on net tax reducing differences which have not been eliminated, and carryforward losses, is based on estimated future earnings. Deferred tax and tax benefits which may be shown in the balance sheet are presented net.
Tax reduction on group contributions given and tax on group contribution received, booked as a reduction of cost price or taken directly to equity, are booked directly against tax in the balance sheet (offset against payable taxes if the group contribution has affected payable taxes, and offset against deferred taxes if the group contribution has affected deferred taxes).

1.6 Cash flow statement
The cash flow statement has been prepared according to the indirect method. Cash and cash equivalents include cash, bank deposits, and other short term investments which immediately and with minimal exchange risk can be converted into known cash amounts, with due date less than three months from purchase date.

Note 2 - Number og employees, remuneration and audit fee

Remuneration to executives:
Salaries/board fee Other remuneration
The average number of employees in the accounting year has been 0 (2016: 0).

Independent Auditor's Report - Viking Redningstjeneste Topco AS

Other information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Board of Directors' report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.
O ur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit o f the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement o f this other information, we are required to report that fact. W e have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities o f the Board o f Directors and the Managing Directorfo r the Financial Statements
The Board o f Directors and the Managing Director (m anagem ent) are responsible for the preparation in accordance with law and regulations, including fair presentation of the financial statements of the parent company in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, and for the preparation and fair presentation o f the financial statements of the group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation o f financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and the G roup's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. The financial statements of the parent company use the going concern basis of accounting insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise will cease operations. The financial statements of the group use the going concern basis o f accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's Responsibilitiesfo r the Audit o f the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level o f assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part o f an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs, we exercise professional judgm ent and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. W e also:

· identify and assess the risks o f material misstatement o f the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. W e design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk o f not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· obtain an understanding o f internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose o f expressing an opinion on the effectiveness o f the Company and the Group's internal control.
· evaluate the appropriateness o f accounting policies used and the reasonableness o f accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· conclude on the appropriateness o f management's use o f the going concern basis o f accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company or the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company or the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
· evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content o f the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
