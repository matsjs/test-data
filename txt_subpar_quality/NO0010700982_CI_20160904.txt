Independent Auditor's Report
Mexico City, May 12, 2016
To the Stockholders of Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro, S. A. P. I. de C. V. and subsidiaries ;
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro, S. A. P. I. de C. V. and subsidiaries (Group), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31,2015 and 2014 and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, of changes in stockholders' equity and of cash flows for the years then ended, as well as a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Management's responsibility for the financial statements
The Company's and subsidiaries' management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and for such internal control as management determines necessary to prepare financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or errors.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures contained in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated . financial statements. . :

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2015 and 2014
Thousands of US dollars, unless otherwise stated
Note 1 -General information:
Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro, S. A. P. I. de C. V., (Oro Negro or the Group) and subsidiaries {the Group) was incorporated on December 17, 2009 in Mexico City to provide integrated and diversified oil field services. Oro Negro currently owns and operates four jack-up rigs denominated Primus, Laurus, Fortius and Decus under four to five year contracts signed with Pemex Perforaciön y Servicios (PPS), a wholly owned subsidiary of Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the Mexico's national oil company (NOC). The jack-up Impetus was delivered in January 2015 and a contract was signed on December 22, 2016 with PPS to lease the asset.
Oro Negro was controlled by three institutional investors, Axis, Ares and Temasek. On May 2, 2016, affiliates of Axis purchased, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro, S A P .I. de C.V. held directly or indirectly by each of Ares and '-Temasek. . .
The Group is domiciled in Javier Barros Sierra 540, Park Plaza Torre 1, Santa Fe, Mexico City.
Note 2 - Liquidity and going concern considerations:
As of December 31, 2015, the Group's total current liabilities of $300,214 exceeded its total current assets of $154,393, resulting in a working capital deficit of $145,821. The working capital deficit is primarily related to the delay in beginning operations with the Impetus. A contract with Pemex (Note 20) was signed on December 22, 2015.
Pemex, pro Negro's only customer, is currently undergoing a major restructuring which implies a new business model. These changes are being implemented in the midst of a global crisis in the oil and gas industry. The average oil price went from $105 per barrel in 2013 to $50 in 2015 and has a forecasted average price of $25 in 2016. The decrease in oil prices has resulted in a liquidity shortage for Pemex which has caused them to change supplier payment conditions from 20 to 180 days.
All these factors triggered the following:
a) Default on the $175,000 bond payment During 2015, the Group breached financial covenants by not complying with financial ratios and failing to pay principal and interest in the amount of $187,038 (including default interest payment of $2,413 at a rate of 16%) registered in the "Current portion of long-term debt" '(Note 15).
b) Default on the $725,000 bond payment During January 2016, the Group failed to make the required principal and interest payment under the terms of the Bond Agreement (Note 15). Consequently, the amount owed under the Bond Agreement of approximately $50,287 accrued a default interest rate of 12.5 % per annum until paid in full.
Management negotiated and signed on April 29, 2016 a new agreement with the bondholders with a maturity date of January 2019 (Note 22). All outstanding defaults were waived and no further action has been taken by the Group's lenders against Oro Negro.

Notes to the Consolidate^ Financial Statements December 31, 2015 and 2014
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Group be unable to continue as a going concern.
Note 3 - Significant events:
· On January 22, 2015 the jack-up "Impetus" was delivered to the Group and on March 28, 2015 the jack-up arrived in Mexico.
· On March 31, 2015, Oro Negro Internationa) (a Cayman Island, exempt company), was legally dissolved and had no impact in the consolidated financial statements.
· On June 26, 2015, PPS and Oro Negro signed amendments to the outstanding charter leases for Oro Negro's rigs Primus, Laurus, Fortius and Decus to reduce the "day rate" beginning June 1, 2015. The rate is valid for 1 year (see Note 20).
· On July 11,2015, in advance of Rig 3's contract expiration date, September 11, 2015, PPS and Oro Negro signed an early termination notification, (see Note 20). At the date of these financial statements the company has not entered into a new lease contract with PPS.
· On October 26 and 29. 2015 PPS and Oro Negro signed amendments to the outstanding charter leases for Oro Negro's rigs Primus, Laurus, Fortius and Decus. The amendments provide a one year extension on the contract terms for each of the above mentioned rigs (see Note 20).
· On December 22, 2015 Oro Negro, through its subsidiary Perforadora Oro Negro, S de R. L. de C. V., entered into a lease contract with PPS for Impetus, which also includes maintenance and mobilization services, (see Note 20).  :
Note 4 - Summary of significant accounting policies:
The following are the main accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
a. Basis of preparation .:
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis.
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or the areas in which assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 6.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2015 and 2014
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
a. New standards and interpretations not vet effective
New standards and amendments will become effective for annual periods beyond the reporting dates of these consolidated financial statements, and have not yet been applied. The Group is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of the following standards: d
IFRS 9 "Financial instruments", addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and in October 2010. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured at fair value and those measured at amortized cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification depends on the entity's business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liability purposes, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity's own credit risk is recorded in "other comprehensive income" rather than in "revenue", unless this results in an 'accounting mismatch.
IFRS 15 "Revenue from contracts with customers", provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries, and across capital markets. The revenue standard establishes that an entity must determine the measurement of revenue and timing for recognition thereof. The underlying principle is that an entity must recognize revenue to support the transfer of goods or services to customers at the amount that the entity expects in exchange for those goods or services. The revenue standard is effective for entities that report under IFRS for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for IFRS reporters.
IFRS 16 "Leases" addresses the definition of a lease, recognition and measurement of leases and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the leasing activities of both lessees and lessors. A key change arising from IFRS 16 is that most operating leases will be accounted for on balance sheet for lessees. The standard replaces IAS 17 "Leases", and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted subject to EU endorsement and the entity adopting IFRS 15 "Revenue from contracts with customers" at the same time.
b. Consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group, and are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities transferred by the former owners to the acquirer and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
Page 9

Jntegradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro, S. A. P. 1. de C. V. and subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2015 and 2014 _

consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.

Inter-company transactions, balances, and unrealized gains and losses on transactions between the subsidiaries of the Group are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated.

On December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Group's subsidiaries were as follows:

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2015 and 2014

Foreign currency translation

i. Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Group's presentation and functional currency.

ii. Transactions and balances , ..V:

Foreign currency transactions are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the dates of the transactions, or at the valuation date when items are re-measured.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end of the exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the income statement. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to "borrowings" and to "cash and cash equivalents" are presented in the income statement under "finance income or costs".

Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss.

iii. Group companies

The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different

from the presentation currency are translated to the presentation currency as follows:

V3412

1) Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date;

2) Share capital is recognized at historical cost;

;

3) Income and expenses of each statement of income are translated at average exchange rates (unless said average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate in effect on the transaction date), and

4) All resulting exchange differences are recognized in "other comprehensive income",

b. Cash and cash equivalents

The consolidated statement of cash flows includes cash and cash equivalents; petty cash; and deposits held at call with financial institutions with original maturities of three months or less.

c. Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collections are expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2015 and 2014 ___

d. Financial assets

Classification

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: loans and receivables. Classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

Loans and receivables

;

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except if its maturities exceed 12 months after the end of the reporting period. Said maturities are classified as non-current assets. The Group's loans and receivables comprise '`trade and other receivables", and "cash and cash equivalents" shown in the statement of financial position.

e. Property and equipment

Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the item's acquisition and transportation costs.

Subsequent costs are included in the assets' carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item wifi flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The book value of the parts that are replaced is cancelled. All other repair and maintenance fees are charged to the statement of comprehensive income for the financial period in which they are incurred.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate asset costs or restated amounts to their residual values oyer their estimated useful lives. The Group estimates thirty years of useful life for its drilling equipment and the contract's maturity for leasehold improvements.

Asset's residual values, useful lives and depreciation method are revised, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognized under "other income" in the statement of income.

f. Intangible assets

Intangible assets are comprised by licenses which are shown at historical cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of licenses over their estimated useful lives of 4 years and is registered in administrative expenses.

g. Current and deferred income tax

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Page 12

Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Ora Negro, S. A. P. I. de C. V. and subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2015 and 2014
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation, for which it sets up provisions of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognized on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; additionally, deferred income tax is not recorded if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable income or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted as of the date of the statement of financial position used and that are expected to be applied when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that is probable that future taxable income will be available against which temporary differences may be offset. UV\ V
Deferred income tax assets are recognized on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can be utilized.
Deferred income tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements, except for deferred income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Generally, the group is unable to control the reversal of the temporary difference for associates, only when there is an agreement in place that gives the group the ability to control the reversal of the temporary difference not ? .'recognized. \
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
h. Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets that are not ready for use are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by whjch the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the highest between of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are large independent cash inflows (cash generating units). Prior impairment, nonfinancial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for a possible reversal at each reporting date.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2015 and 2014
i. Impairment of financial assets
For the loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate, The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. : .
If in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized (such as an improvement in the debtor's credit rating), reversal of the previously recognized impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
j. Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the payment : is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method if greater than one year.
k. Borrowings V
Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction ; costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
l. Borrowing costs V;Vn -,y
General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to be ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognized as profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
m. Employee benefits
The Group does not have a defined contribution plan except those required under the Mexican law.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the regular retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for those benefits. ::
Statutory profit-sharing
The Group recognizes a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to the Group's shareholders after certain

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2015 and 2014

adjustments. The Group recognizes a provision where it is contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

' n. Provisions 

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.

When there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in a settlement is determined by considering the type of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of a cash outflow required to settle any of the obligations included in the same . 'class of obligations is small...

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks related to the obligation A :-V

0. Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

p. Share premium

The share premium represents the excess of the payment on the subscription of shares over the nominal value thereof. .

q. Recognition of leasing and maintenance service revenue

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, and represents amounts receivable, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes. The Group recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity, and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group's activities, as described below..

The drilling equipment is leased out under operating leases to PPS, the Group's sole customer. The corresponding assets are included in the statement of financial position given that a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the Group. Lease income is received on a fixed daily rate basis and is recognized over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis.

The Group also provides the personnel to perform maintenance services. Maintenance income is part of the daily rate received for leasing drilling equipment. Maintenance income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract with PPS, since the services are performed by an indeterminate number of acts during the length of the contract.

r. Mobilization costs and fees

-

Mobilization costs are costs incurred to move and place equipment ready for its intended use. Such costs generally include expenses incurred for transportation of drilling equipment prior to commencement of the lease and maintenance services. Such contract costs are recognized as an asset provided that it is probable for them to be recovered through the fees set forth in the contract. Given the significance of mobilization costs, the Group often receives a "mobilization fee", which can

Page 15

Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro, S. A . P. I. de C. V. and subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2015 and 2014

be in the form of a lump sum payment or on a per day rate, depending on the agreement signed with ; p p s . v-7"

Mobilization fees are recognized with the rest of the contract fees over the term of the contract.

In the statements of financial position, the mobilization cost is recognized within "current portion of deferred costs", and "deferred costs". Mobilization fees are recognized within "current portion of deferred revenue", and "deferred revenue".

Note 5 - Financial risk management:

5.1 Financial risk factors

The Group's activities have exposure to the following financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk and price risk.

The Group assesses its risk exposure on a continuous basis and develops different strategies to mitigate 'its. exposure, ;7 

(a) Credit risk

Credit risk is generated from cash and cash equivalents, deposits in banks and financial institutions and accounts receivable. PPS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Petroleos Mexicanos with a credit rating of BBB+, is the Group's only customer (see Note 20).

In 2015 and 2014, the Group signed various different agreements signed with PPS to lease drilling equipment and provide maintenance services.

(b) Liquidity risk

The Group's strategic planning and treasury department continuously monitors the Group's cash flow projections and liquidity requirements to ensure that it has sufficient readily available cash to comply with its .operations. 7

Projections consider the Group's financial plans, purchase commitments, compliance with minimum internal liquidity ratios and legal and regulatory requirements.

The following table analyzes the Group's financial liabilities grouped in accordance with their contractual maturity at the reporting date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and include interest expenses:

0) Contractual commitments as of December 31,2015 and 2014 (see Note 21).

Obligations related to the purchase of jack-up rigs will be paid through debt issuance or capital contributions from the Group's stockholders.

(c) Price risk

The Group recognizes its revenue based on a daily fixed rate. The drop in oil price combined with PPS's restructuring plans could lead to contract renegotiations that in turn could potentially impact future revenues.

Service contracts signed with PPS include an unilateral 30 days' notice termination clause enforceable by PPS as customary in the Mexican oil and gas market and in accordance to governmental contracting law.

5.2 Capital risk management

The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure while optimizing the cost of capital.

The Group monitors capital on the basis of the leverage ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including "current and non-current borrowings" as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as `equity' as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.

During 2015 and 2014, the Group's strategy was to maintain its leverage ratio within a range of 50% 70%. On December 31, 2015 and 2014 the Group's leverage ratios were as follows:

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2015 and 2014
(d) Fair value interest rate risk
The Group's interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group maintains all its borrowings at fixed rates.
Note 6 - Critical accounting estimates and assumptions:
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on the historical experience and other factors, including expected future events that are considered to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal actual results. The estimates and assumptions that pose a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying accounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.
a. Estimated impairment of property and equipment
The Group reviews its property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. In the year ended December 31, 2014, the Group recognized a loss of $7,093 associated with the impairment of the Rig 3. Rationale of :: impairment include: future expectations of lower day rates or rig utilization, obsolescence of the Rig 3 technology and uncertainty regarding contract renewal with PPS due to the above mentioned factors. In the year ended December 31, 2015 no impairment was registered because there was an expectation that PPS was going to assign a new contract for Rig 3.
These assumptions and Management's judgments are subject to change as new information becomes available. Changes in economic conditions can also affect the rate used to discount future cash flow estimates (see Note 14). V;
b. Income tax
The Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. When the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
c. Receivables with Pemex
The Group records its receivables as totally recoverable under the assumption that Pemex, since the beginning of the business relation, has never avoided paying any invoice, and there are procedures to certify that each "leasing generator" is approved by Pemex and the Group before the issuance of any invoice, completing all the legal requirements to collect the services delivered.
d. Recognition of deferred tax assets (see Note 18)
Deferred tax assets are recognized for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that realization of the related tax benefit is probable. As at 31 December 2015, $91,283 (2014: $46,668) of deferred tax assets
Page 18

Integradora deServicios Petrgleros Oro Negro, S. A. P. 1. de C. V. and subsidiaries
Notes to Ihe Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2015 and 2014

related to available loss carry forwards are disclosed as deferred tax assets. In evaluating whether it is probable that taxable profits will be earned in future accounting periods prior to any tax loss expiry as may be the case, all available evidence was considered, including approved budgets, forecasts and business plans and, in certain cases, analysis of historical operating results. These forecasts are consistent with those prepared and used internally for business planning and impairment testing purposes. Following this evaluation, it was determined there would be sufficient taxable income generated to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets and that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would result in a material reduction in forecast headroom of tax profits so that the recognized deferred tax asset would not be realized. .

If the Group didn't recognized 10% of the tax loss carry forwards, the deferred tax assets would have been $9,128 ($4,667 in 2014) lower and the profit for the year would have been $4,461 lower at December 31, 2015 ($4,178 in 2014).

e. Prepayment for jack-up acquisitions (see Note 21)

Under the terms of the contract with PPL Shipyard PTE Ltd., for the construction of the oil rigs Vastus, Supremus and Animus, Oro Negro made prepaymets in the amount of $125,100 recognized as T v "Prepayments for jack-up acquisitions" in the statement of financial position as of December 31, 2015.

Due to the circumstances related to the global drop in oil prices, Oro Negro failed to pay the final installment of 80% of the total cost (US$625,500) and failed to take delivery and acceptance of the oil rigs that would have taken place between June and September, 2015.

The contract stipulates that in the case of a default, the oil rigs shall remain property of PPL Shipyard PTE, who will also be entitled to retain all payments made to them under the contract with Oro Negro. The Group used a significant judgment to conclude that the prepayments made as of December 31, 2015 were not impaired and that it is the Company's intention to acquire the oil rigs in the new settlement date.

As of December 31, 2015, if the cost of the oil rigs would have been 20% lower, the Group would have recognized an impairment loss of $25,020 and the loss of the year would have been higher by that amount.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2015 and 2014

Depreciation expenses amounted $40,564 and $32,050 for the period ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, they are included as operating costs and administrative expenses (see Note 7).
Intangible assets amortization of $206 and $220 for the period ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, have been charged as operating costs.

Impairment of Rig 3

If assets are determined to be impaired, the carrying amounts of those assets are written down to their recoverable amount, which is the highest between the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.

Value in use is determined as the amount of estimated risk-adjusted discounted future cash flows. For this purpose, assets are grouped into Cash-Generating Units {CGUs) based on separately identifiable and largely independent cash inflows. The Group identified as CGUs each of the jack-ups (Primus, Laurus, Fortius and Decus) and Rig 3. Estimates of future cash flows used in the valuation of impairment of assets are made using management's forecasts of demand and day rates. Cash flow estimates are risk-adjusted to reflect local conditions as appropriate and discounted at a rate based on the Group's . weighted average cost of capital. /.

Impairment, except that related to goodwill, is reversed as applicable to the extent that the events or circumstances that triggered the original impairment have changed.

On December 31, 2014, the Group recognized an impairment loss of $7,093 related to the Rig 3. The key assumption used for value-in-use calculations in 2014 was the pre-tax discount rate of 8.65%.

A change in assumptions could affect the carrying amount of assets and impairment charges would affect income. If the pre-tax discount rate used in the value-in-use calculation was 10% lower than the Management's estimates, the Group would have recognized a lower impairment loss for Rig 3 of $392. If Management's estimates was 10% higher, the Group would have recognized a further impairment loss for Rig 3 of $380.
