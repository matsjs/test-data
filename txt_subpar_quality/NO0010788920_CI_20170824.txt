Management's Review
Summary Jacob Holm & Sønner Holding A/S and its subsidiaries ("Jacob Holm", the "Company" or the "Group") con cluded its second quarter of the financial year 2017 with revenues of DKK 588 million and an EBITDA of DKK 46 million. Increasing raw material prices were a key driver for the slightly higher topline, but among other factors also caused an increase in net working capital and put pressure on operating margins due to the contractual lag in passing through on sales prices for selected programs. However, this was compensated by a favorable product mix and a solid operational performance in Q2 2017 leading to an increase in EBITDA margin vs. the previous quarter.

Financial Review
Revenue Revenue in Q2 2017 increased by DKK 6 million or 1% to DKK 588 million compared with DKK 582 million in Q l 2017. The competitive situation in North America and Europe continued to be tight due to the unfavourable supply demand balance in selected end markets. Operating expenses Cost of goods sold in Q2 2017 totalled DKK 501 million representing 85% of revenue compared with DKK 511 million or 88% in Q1 2017. The lower cost of goods sold were among others a result of improved operational performance compared to the previous quarter. Other operating expenses amounted to DKK 41 million or 7% of revenue in Q2 2017 compared with DKK 39 million or 7% in Q1 2017. Depreciation charges of DKK 32 million in Q2 2017 were in line with the previous quarter. EBITDA The Group delivered an EBITDA of DKK 46 million in Q2 2017 compared to DKK 31 million in Q1 2017, repre senting an increase in EBITDA margin of +3.4%. Financial income and expenses The Group's financial income and expenses related to borrowing costs for the bonds and other financing ar rangements were DKK 41 million in Q2 2017 compared to DKK 11 million in Q1 2017. The increase in Q2 2017 was mainly related to the refinancing of the Bond. Taxes The Group reported a tax credit of DKK 14 million in Q2 2017, compared with a tax expense of DKK 5 million in Q1 2017. Net profit The net loss was DKK 32 million in Q2 2017 compared with a net loss of DKK 8 million in Q1 2017. Equity Equity decreased to DKK 394 million in Q2 2017 based on the negative result for the period, changes in exchange rates and a DKK 25 million dividend to the Parent company. Net debt The net debt at the end of Q2 2017 was DKK 914 million compared with DKK 808 million at the end of Q1 2017. The increase in net debt was driven by several factors, among others the call premium on the SEK bond, the Bond refinancing costs, an increase in net working capital as well as the dividend distribution to the Parent company.

The net proceeds of the news bonds were used to refinance the bonds issued in 2014 and for general corporate purposes.
