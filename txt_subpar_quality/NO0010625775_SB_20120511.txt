1) Acceptance from the Bondholders to issue the Bank Loan and thus include this in the carveouts to Clause 13.4 (h) "FinancialIndebtedness" in the loan agreement.

2) The Company propose to change the definition of the Share Pledges in the loan agreement. The new wording will be:

"Share Pledge" means

(A) the first priority pledge granted by the Issuer over all its shares in:

(i)

Havilafjord;

(ii) Havila Shipping; and

(iii) All shares in subsidiaries fully or partly owned by the Company with paid in equity higher than NOK 30.000.000 established after signing of this agreement until Maturity of the Bond Loan.

and

(b) the first priority pledge granted by Havilaijord over all its shares in Fjordl Nordvestlandske;

and

(B) the second priority pledge granted by the Issuer over all its shares in:

(iv) Havila Ariel; and

(v) Havyard

The Bond Trustee shall be authorised to enter into an intercreditoragreement with the lenders of the Senior Bank Loan. Such intercreditoragreement may i.a. contain provision preventing the Bond Trustee to enforce the second priority pledge during a 180 days standstill period.

The new definition will replace the existing definition of Share Pledge. If full redemption of the Bank Loan, the share pledge in Havila Ariel and Havyard will be changed from second priority to first priority pledge.

3) The Company propose to change the definition under § 13.4 (i) "Negative Pledge "to constitute the following:

(i) Negative Pledge
The Issuer shall not, and shall ensure that Havilafjord do not, create, incur or allow to exist any Encumbrance on any of its shares in Havilafjord, Fjordl Nordvestlandske and Havila Shipping, save for the security granted for the Bond Issue, Further, the Issuer shall not create, incur or allow to exist any Encumbrance on any of its existing assets (for the avoidance of doubt, to include all shares acquired in Havila Ariel), save for:

(i) security granted for the Bond Issue

(ii) the existing mortgage on the Havila Group's head-office granted as security for loan in the amount of NOK 41.2 million to Fokus Bank;

The Bond Trustee is given the power of attorney to carry out the necessary completion work, including make other related and necessary amendments to the Bond Agreement. To approve the above resolution, Bondholders representing at least 1/2 of the Voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting (in person or by proxy) and 2/3 o f the Voting Bonds represented at the Bondholders' Meeting must vote in favour o f the resolution. If the proposal is not adopted, the Bond Agreement will remain unchanged. Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership o f the Bonds and of the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting.1 The individual bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising the Bond Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page o f this letter for further details). In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof o f the ownership of the Bonds. For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond Trustee, to notify the Bond Trustee by telephone or by e-mail (at set out at the first page o f this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
