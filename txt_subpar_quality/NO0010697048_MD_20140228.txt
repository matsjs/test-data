N OR 06, NOR 10 AND NOR 11 - INFORMATION ABOUT PREPAYMENT OFFER
1. INTRODUCTION This letter is sent to Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Bond Trustee") in its capacity as trustee for the bondholders (together, the "Bondholders") in the above bond issues (together the "Bonds" / "Bond Issues") with Norwegian Energy Company ASA as issuer (the "Company", "Noreco" or the "Issuer" and together with its subsidiaries the "Group"). ISIN NO 001 060632.0 (the "NOR06 Bond") is a NOK , 600 000,000 bond issue, ISIN NO 001 069703.0 (the "NOR10 Bond") is a NOK , , 1 399 050,000 bond issue, ISIN NO 001 069704.8 (the "NORu Bond") is a NOK , 736 155,000 bond issue.

Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreements for the Bond Issues dated 6 December 2013 (and as amended for the NOR11 Bond on 11 February ) 2014 (each a "Bond Agreement"and together, the "Bond Agreements"), respectively, unless otherwise stated herein.

2. THE PREPAYMENT OFFER EVENTAND PREPAYMENT OFFER Reference is made to previous communications by Noreco regarding its obligations to provide security for the future removal decommissioning expenses on the Nini and Nini East field (license

NO RECO-#i 23H9-v i-NOR_o6 _ N O R _ io_AND_NOR_ii_-JNFORMATION_ABOUT_PR£FAYMENT_OFFER

no. 4/95) and the Cecilie field (license no. 16/98) in Denmark (the "Danish Abandonment Costs"), and for which DKK 500 million has been reserved as part of the recent refinancing. As announced on 20 February , 2014 the discussions between Noreco and the license partners have now been concluded with an agreement between Noreco, Dong and RWE Dea pursuant to which Noreco shall deposit DKK 445 million in cash in an escrow account for the benefit of the operator Dong, to serve as security for its part o f the Danish Abandonment Costs. As a consequence of the actual amount set aside for the Danish Abandonment Costs being less than DKK 500 million, and as set out in the Bond Agreements, a Prepayment Offer Event is deemed to have occurred. Noreco thus hereby through the Bond Trustee provides the Bondholders (i.e. the holders of bonds in all its secured bond loans) with a Prepayment Offer in accordance with the Bond Agreements Clause 10.6 for the NOR06 Bond and Clause 10.5 of the NOR10 and NOR11 Bonds of the residual Prepayment Offer Amount, i.e. DKK 55 million, which is equal to NOK ,61 633,000 using the daily exchange rate published by Norges Bank on 20 February . 2014 The Prepayment Offer Amount is to be made at 100% of par value and shared among all the Bondholders on a pro rata and pari passu basis. With a total outstanding amount on all Bonds of NOK 2,735,205,000, the Prepayment Offer Amount represents an offer to each Bondholder for repayment ofapproximately 2.2533%of each Bondholder's holdings in each of the Bond Issues. The relevant amount to be offered repaid to each Bondholder will be rounded down to the nearest NOK 1, which is the Face Value of all the Bonds.
3. PREPAYMENT OFFER PERIOD - ACCEPTANCE In accordance with the terms of the Bond Agreements, there shall be a period of 60 Business Days from the launch of the Prepayment Offer until the deadline for acceptance thereof. Said period starts running from the day the Prepayment Offer is submitted to the Bondholders through the VPS. Each Bondholder may only exercise its rights under the Prepayment Offer for each Bond Issue in full (and not partly), and there will be no right to be repaid any higher amount than the relative ownership of Bonds reflects for each Bondholder. Each Bondholder wishing to exercise its rights under the Prepayment Offer shall respond as set out in the instruction letter from the Bond Trustee that will be circulated to the Bondholders with this letter. Said instruction letter will also determine the exact expiry date of the Prepayment Offer acceptance period (the "Record Date"). It is only the Bondholders that are registered as holders of Bonds as per the Record Date that will receive settlement for redeemed Bonds under the Prepayment Offer. A Bondholder exercising its rights under the Prepayment Offer as set out herein may expect settlement of its relevant repayment amount and redemption of the corresponding Bonds within such period after the Record Date as is necessary for the Securities Depository procedure to complete the transaction (the date of settlement referred to as the "Settlement Date"). Said procedure will be described in the above mentioned Bond Trustee instruction letter. Outstanding accrued interest on the Bonds for which the Prepayment Offer is being exercised, for the period until the Settlement Date, will be paid to the respective Bondholder on the Settlement Date together with settlement of the relevant part of the Prepayment Offer Amount.
