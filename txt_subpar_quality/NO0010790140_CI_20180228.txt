Organic growth in Sweden (+30 percent) and Denmark (+14 percent) is still driving the increased volume, although Norway performed well in 4Q17, outperforming 4Q16 by 9 percent.
The group average assistance gross margin for the fourth quarter was 35,5 percent and ended higher than the previous quarter (33,5 percent) and 4Q16 (35,1 percent).
