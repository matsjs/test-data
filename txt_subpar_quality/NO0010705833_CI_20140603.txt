Ridgebury Crude Tankers Reports Results for the Period ended March 31,2014

May 29, 2013, Westport, CT

Ridgebury Crude Tankers ("RCT" or "the Company") released its financial results for the period from February 27,2014 (the date of the Company's inception) through March 31,2014.

The Company did not have significant assets or operations prior to a reorganization of the Ridgebury Group effective March 19,2014, which entailed the contribution of two owned Suezmaxes plus deposits and contracts to purchase an additional five Suezmaxes to the Company.

RCT then issued $210 million of senior secured bonds on March 20,2014, with primary use of proceeds to finance the acquisition of the remaining Suezmax fleet.

Results for the period ended March 31,2014 thus primarily reflect the initial financing transactions plus 11 days revenue and expense from two Suezmax vessels, the Ridgebury Lessley B and Ridgebury John Zipser.

Ridgebury took delivery of the remaining five vessels under contract at the time of the bond offering during the month of April 2014 as follows:
