Report o f the statutory auditor
to the General Meeting o fJacob Holm & Sons AG
Basel
Report on the audit o f the consolidatedfinancial statements
Opinion On your instructions, we have audited the consolidated financial statements of Jacob Holm & Sons AG and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017 and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive in come, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant ac counting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the con solidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2017 and its consolidated financial perfor mance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the International Finan cial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law.
Basisfo r opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and Swiss Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further de scribed in the "Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements" section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as the IESBA Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Responsibilities o f the Board o fDirectorsfo r the consolidatedfinancial statements The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated finan cial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilitiesfor the audit o f the consolidatedfinancial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's re port that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards will always de tect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are consid ered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the eco nomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

PricewaterhouseCoopers AG is a member of the global PricewaterhouseCoopers network of firms, each of which is a separate and independent legal entity.

As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise profes sional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal con trol.
· Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting esti mates and related disclosures made.
· Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our au ditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, inclu ding the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
· Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or busi ness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant defi ciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies
The Annual Report of Jacob Holm & Sons AG for 2017 is prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Annual Report for 2017 is presented in CHF '000 unless stated otherwise. The applied accounting policies are unchanged compared to the previous year.
New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for an nual periods beginning after 1 January 2018, and have not been applied in preparing the consoli dated financial statement.
IFRS 9, `Financial instruments' addresses the requirements for recognition and measurement,
impairment, derecognition and general hedge accounting. A new credit loss model has replaced the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. The standard becomes effective from 2018, and the Group will implement the standard when it becomes effective. The implementation of IFRS 9 will have no effect on the income statements and balance sheets for 2017 and previous years.
IFRS 15, `Revenue from contracts with customers' deals with revenue recognition and es
tablishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the na ture, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 `Revenue' and IAS 11 `Construction contracts' and related interpretations and be comes effective from 2018. The Group will implement the standard when it becomes effective. The Group assess that there will be no impact on the Group from IFRS 15.
IFRS 16, "Leases", which amends the rules for the lessee's accounting treatment of operating
leases. In future, operating leases must therefore be recognised in the balance sheet as lease assets and similar lease liabilities. The standard has not yet been adopted by the EU and will become ef fective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group expects to implement the standard when it becomes effective. The Group is in the process of examining the effect of the standard, which cannot yet be calculated. The IASB has approved further new standards and interpretations that are not relevant to Jacob Holm & Sons AG and will have no effect on the Financial Statements.

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies (continued)
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Parent Company Jacob Holm & Sons AG and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has control. The group controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the en tity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the basis of the Financial Statements of the Parent Company and the group companies by combining items of a uniform nature, and elimina tion is made of intercompany income and expenses, intercompany accounts as well as profits and losses on transactions between the consolidated companies. The results of foreign group companies are translated into Swiss Franc at average exchange rates. The balance sheets are translated into Swiss Franc at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Exchange adjustments in this connec tion are made over the statement of comprehensive income.
Business combinations
On acquisition of subsidiaries including acquisition of subsidiaries under common control, the ac quisition method is applied.
Purchase price of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially measured at fair value at the time of acquisition. Identifiable intangible fixed assets are recognised if they can be separated and the fair value can be measured reliably. Deferred tax is recognised on re-measure ments made. Any remaining positive differences between the cost and the fair value of assets, liabil ities and contingent liabilities acquired are recognised in intangible fixed assets in the balance sheet as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (`the functional cur rency'). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Swiss Franc which is the parent company's functional and presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recognised at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Exchange differences arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the rates at the dates of payment are recognised in financial income and expenses in the income statement.
Receivables, payables and other monetary items in foreign currencies are translated at the ex change rates at the balance sheet date. Differences between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the rates at the time of the establishment of the receivable or payable or recognition in the most recent Financial Statements are recognised in financial income and expenses in the income statement.
10

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies (continued)
Balance sheet items including goodwill for consolidated companies that do not have Swiss Franc as their functional currency are translated into Swiss Franc at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date, whereas the income statements of these companies are translated at average exchange rates for the month. Exchange adjustments arising on the translation of the opening equity at year-end rates and net profit for the year at year-end rates are recognised directly in equity under a separate reserve for exchange adjustments.
Income Statement Revenue and recognition of income Revenue from sale of goods is measured at fair value of the consideration received net of goods sold excluding VAT and net of provisions for returns and discounts.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the amount of revenue can be reliably meas ured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each of the group's activities. In general revenue is recognized when the goods are de livered in accordance with the agreed upon contractual terms.
Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold comprises costs incurred to achieve revenue for the year. Cost comprises raw materials, consumables, direct labour costs and indirect production costs such as maintenance and depreciation, as well as operation, administration and management of factories and distribution expenses including salaries to distribution staff.
Cost of goods sold also includes research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalisa tion as well as amortisation of capitalised development costs.
Sales and marketing expenses
Sales and marketing expenses comprise costs in the form of salaries to sales staff, advertising and marketing expenses as well as operation of motor vehicles and depreciation.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses comprise expenses for Management, administrative staff, office expenses, depreciation, etc.
Other operating income and expenses
Other operating income and other operating expenses comprise items of a secondary nature to the core activities of the companies, including gains and losses on disposals of intangible fixed assets and property, plant and equipment as well as subsidies received which do not directly relate to the purchase of non-current assets.
11

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies (continued) Special items
Special items comprise income and expenses outside normal operations which are at the same time non-recurring income and expenses. Special items comprise income and expense arising from events and transactions such as due diligence re. potential acquisitions, integration costs and larger restructuring or organisational changes.
Financial income and expenses
Financial income and expenses comprise interest, financial expenses in respect of finance leases, realised and unrealised exchange adjustments, price adjustment of securities and amortisation of financial assets and liabilities. Financial expenses directly attributable to purchases, construction or production of a qualifying as set are included as part of the expenses relating to the asset. All other financial expenses are recog nised in expenses in the financial year in which they were incurred. A qualifying asset is an asset for which considerable time is required to make it ready for its in tended use or for sale.
Tax on profit for the year
Tax for the year consists of current tax for the year and deferred tax for the year. The tax attributa ble to the profit for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to items recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income and tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement.

Notes to the Annual Report, Group

1 Accounting Policies (continued) Balance Sheet

Intangible fixed assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of identifiable net as sets of the acquired enterprise. Goodwill is measured at historical cost less accumulated impair ment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the Group's operating segments. The allocation is completed no later than at the end of the reporting period fol lowing the acquisition.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or on indication of impairment. In the event of impair ment, the carrying amount is written down to the value in use. Impairment charges on goodwill are not reversed.

Customer lists, know-how, patents and licenses, trademarks and software are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is made on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life, which are:

Customer lists, know-how, patents and licenses 3-10 years

Trademarks

20 years

Software

3-5 years

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recognised at cost less accumulated depreciation and less any accumulated impairment losses.

Cost comprises the purchase price and costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of assets of own construction, cost com prises directly attributable costs for labour, materials, components and sub-suppliers. The cost price of new product lines comprise costs related to the commissioning of the production line up until the point in time where the production line is ready for commercial production. Commission ing costs comprise costs such as test runs and repair and maintenance activities.

The initial estimate of the costs of dismantling assets for which there is a legal obligation to dis mantle at the end of the useful life of the asset is included as part of the cost price of the asset.

Income from the sale of products during the commissioning period is set off against the cost of the asset.

Government grants received are set off against the cost of assets qualifying for the subsidy.

Depreciation based on cost reduced by any residual value is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, which are:

Buildings

30-50 years

13

Notes to the Annual Report, Group

1 Accounting Policies (continued)

Plant and machinery

10-15 years

Other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment 3-10 years

Spare parts included in plant and machinery are depreciated over 5 years.

Gains or losses from the sale of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference be tween the selling price net of selling expenses and the carrying amount at the time of the sale. Gains or losses from current replacement of property, plant and equipment are recognised in other oper ating income and expenses in the income statement.

Impairment of fixed assets
The carrying amounts of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether there is any indication of impairment other than that expressed by amortisation and depreciation. If so, an impairment test is carried out to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, and the asset is written down to its lower recoverable amount.
The asset is written down to its recoverable amount if this is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable amount of the asset is calculated as the higher of net selling price and value in use. Where a recoverable amount cannot be determined for the individual asset, the assets are assessed in the smallest group of assets for which a reliable recoverable amount can be determined based on a total assessment.
Impairment losses are reversed to the extent that changes have taken place in the assumptions or estimates leading to the write-down for impairment. Impairment losses are only reversed to the ex tent that the new carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount which the asset would have had, had it not been written down for impairment. Impairment on goodwill is not re versed.
Financial fixed assets
Other receivables
Receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets.

Bonds at fair value through profit or loss
Bonds at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. Bonds are classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.

14

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies (continued)
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost under the FIFO method and net realisable value. The net realisable value of inventories is calculated at the amount expected to be generated by sale in the process of normal operations with deduction of selling expenses and costs of completion. The net realisable value is determined allowing for marketability, obsolescence and development in ex pected sales.
The cost of goods for resale, raw materials and consumables equals landed cost.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises the cost of raw materials, consumables and direct labour as well as directly attributable labour and production costs. These costs also com prise maintenance and depreciation of the machinery, factory buildings and equipment used in the manufacturing process as well as costs of production management.
Receivables
Receivables are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of amortised cost and net realisable value, which corresponds to nominal value less provisions for bad debts. Provisions for bad debts are determined on the basis of an individual assessment of each receivable.
Dividend
Dividend is recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the Annual General Meeting. Divi dend expected to be paid for the year is disclosed as a separate equity item.
Corporation tax and deferred tax
Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet as tax calculated on the taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable income for prior years and for taxes paid on account.
Deferred tax is measured according to the balance sheet liability method in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities.
However, deferred tax is not recognised in respect of temporary differences concerning goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and other items where temporary differences - apart from business acquisitions - have arisen at the time of acquisition without affecting the profit for the year or the taxable income. In cases where the computation of the tax base may be made according to alterna tive tax rules, deferred tax is measured on the basis of the intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively.
Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carry-forwards, are recognised at the value at which they are expected to be utilised, either by elimination in tax on future earnings or by set-off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction.
Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates in the respective countries that will be effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Any changes in deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement unless the deferred tax relates to equity entries.

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies (continued) Staff obligations
Wages and salaries, social security contributions, paid absence and sickness absence, bonuses and non-monetary contributions are recognised in the financial year in which the Group's employees have performed the related work. Expenses relating to the Group's long-term staff benefits are ac crued so that they follow the performance of work by the employees concerned. The Group's pension schemes comprise defined contribution plans. Moreover, provisions are made for seniority based bonuses earned over the employment period.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when - as a result of an event occurred before or on the balance sheet date - the Company has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that economic benefits must be given up to settle the obligation. Provisions comprise mainly dismantling cost related to assets held on leased land. Provisions are measured at Management's best estimate of the amount at which the liability is ex pected to be settled. At the measurement of provisions, discounting is made of the expenses neces sary to settle the liability if this has a material effect on the measurement of the liability.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at fair value less related transaction costs paid. Subsequently, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective in terest method. Any difference between the proceeds initially received and the nominal value is rec ognised in the income statement under Financial expenses over the term of the loan.
Financial liabilities also include the capitalised residual obligations on finance leases, which are measured at amortised cost.
Cash Flow Statement The cash flow statement shows cash flows for the year broken down by operating, investing and fi nancing activities, changes for the year in cash and cash equivalents as well as cash and cash equiv alents at the beginning and end of the year. Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the net profit for the year adjusted for non cash operating items, changes in working capital, financial income/expenses and corporation tax paid.
16

Notes to the Annual Report, Group
1 Accounting Policies (continued) Cash flows from investing activities
Cash flows from investing activities comprise cash flows from acquisitions and disposals of intangi ble fixed assets, property, plant and equipment as well as financial fixed asset investments.
Cash flows from financing activities

2 Significant accounting estimates
Estimates andjudgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and otherfactors, including expectations offuture events that Management believes are reasonable underthe circumstances. The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by nature, seldom equal the actual outcome. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets within the next financial year are discussed below. Impairment test - Goodwill Goodwill is not amortised but is subjectto an annual impairmenttest. In Management's view, the assumptions applied reflect the market conditions existing as of 31 December 2017. The impairment test is a complex process that requires significant Managementjudgement in determining various assumptions, such as general market development, cash-flow projections, discount rates and terminal growth rates. The assumptions for significant goodwill amounts are set out in note 14. Impairment test - Property Plant and Equipment (PPE) An impairmenttest has been performed on PPE related to the Jacob Holm Industries segment's PPE in USA. In Management's view, the assumptions applied reflect the market conditions existing as of 31 December 2017. The impairment test is a complex process that requires significant Managementjudgement in determining various assumptions, such as cash-flow projections including remaining useful life and capex needed during the remaining useful life and the applied discount rate.

Goodwill can be broken out on the activities Sontara and TWIG with CHF 13.189k and CHF 325k. respectively.
The Group has performed impairment test of Goodwill per 31 December 2017.
The majority ofthe TWIG Group was merged into Sontara AG effective January 1, 2017. In consequence, there is no separate management reporting available for this part anymore, that the Group has performed the impairment test on the basis of an overall valuation of Sontara AG. The conclusion was that there was no need for impairment.
The valuation of Sontara was prepared on basis of the approved budget for 2018 and calculated as a value in use with a terminal growth of 0% and a pre-tax WACC of 6.5%.
At year-end Management has assessed that the key assumption used to determine value in use of Sontara is the demand for non-woven including available by-products.
It is assumed that reasonable possible changes in key assumptions are not expected to cause a change in the need for impairment.

The Group's recognised tax loss is subject to varying conditions and is expected fully utilised for set-off against positive taxable income within a 5 year period.

Two ofthe entities to which the tax loss carry-forward relates to were not profitable in 2017. Management has assessed that there is some uncertainty as to the timing of utilizing the tax loss carry-forward, that it has derecognised the part ofthe tax loss carry-forward which relates to the period after 5 years. The assessment is based on budgets for 2018.

22 Other staff obligations

The Group offers part ofthe employees to participate in pension schemes in the form of defined contribution plans.
The provision for other staff obligations primarily includes seniority based bonuses for employees calculated by an actuary taking into account the expected turnover among employees, wage increases etc. A discount factor of 1,30% has been used against 1,31% in 2016.

As the obligation is uncertain as regards the time of settlement, no breakdown of time of maturity can be made. The entire obligation has therefore been classified as a non-current liability.

29 Financial risks
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, bond investments as well as credit exposure to customers and other outstanding receivables.
Credit risk is managed on a group basis. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of `A' are accepted.
Ifwholesale customers are independently rated, these ratings are used. Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, risk control assesses the credit quality ofthe customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and otherfactors. Individual risk limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by Management. The compliance with credit limits by wholesale customers is regularly monitored by line management.
Current follow-up is made on outstanding accounts in accordance with the Group's trade receivables procedures. Where uncertainty arises as to a customer's ability or willingness to pay, and it is estimated that the trade receivable is subject to risk, a bad debt provision is made.
Credit quality
The Group has a factoring agreement in place for one of the plants, which does not qualify for derecognition. The total amount included under the factoring agreement amounts to CHF 9 m (2016: CHF 11m), ofwhich an amount of approx. CHF 8m (2016: CHF 8m) is covered by credit insurance. The associated liability amounts to CHF 9m (2016: CHF 9m).
Othertrade receivables are not covered by credit insurance
Generally the Group's trade receivables is concentrated on a smaller number of customers ofwhich several are highly rated large multinational customers which supports the low bad debt provision.
The overdue balance on trade receivables is specified as follows at 31 December 2017:

Liquidity risk
The Group ensures sufficient cash resources by entering into framework agreements for current overdraft facilities. Existing agreements with agreed upon repayment terms cannot be terminated by the banks unless there is a breach ofthe covenants stated in the loan agreements.
In the event of breach of a covenant the Group has the right to remedy without undue delay, respectively the bank is entitled to terminate part or all of the outstanding loan facilities, should the Group not be able to do so.
There were no covenant breaches during 2017.
Some of the Group's credit facilities are variable due to the fact that some of the Group's credit lines are based on the amount of the Group's trade receivables and inventory.
The analysis of due dates is stated on the basis of category and class broken down on due date. The calculation of interest payments on floating-rate obligations is based on the interest rate on the balance sheet date.
The cash need is expected covered by the current liquidity surplus from operations, bonds at fair value, unutilised credits as well as via refinancing or new non-current loans.

29 Financial risks (continued)
Fairvalue of bond investments is based on quoted prices (level 1). Fairvalue ofthe issued bond is based on the latest market price published by Oslo Børs. Fair value offloating rate loans from credit institutions is based on an assessment of the current margin on such loan arrangements (level 2). Fair value of cash and cash equivalents and short term receivables and payables is determined to equal the nominal amount.

Market risk
The Group's credits and bonds are floating-rate credits and bonds, which exposes the Group to fluctuations in interest rates. It is Group policy that all financing ofworking capital and investments in non-current assets take place at floating interest rate.
No derivative financial instruments are used to hedge interest rate risk.
Based on interest-bearing debt atthe balance sheet date, an increase in the EUR market rate by 1% would decrease the profit for the year before tax of CHF 1.142k (2016: CHF 95k) and a similar effect on equity and an increase in all other market rates by 1% would decrease the profit for the year before tax of CHF 256k (2016: CHF 1.327k) and a similar effect on equity.

The Group's currencies used for payment are mostly distributed between EUR and USD. No financial instruments are used to hedge positions in foreign currency.

As the individual group companies primarily operate in their individual functional currencies, the Group's profit is primarily sensitive to changes in exchange rates related to intercompany accounts and receivables/ payables denominated in other currencies than the functional currency.

The two currencies to which profit/loss ofthe Group is most sensitive is USD and EUR.

A 10% increase in USD compared to the exchange rate at 31 December 2017 towards all other currencies will entail a positive change of profit for the year before tax of CHF 4.352k (2016: positive change of CHF 3.521k) and a similar effect on equity.

A 10% increase in EUR compared to the exchange rate at 31 December 2017 towards all other currencies will entailanegative change of p ro fitfo rthe yea rb efore tax ofC HF 11.346k(2016: positive change ofC HF 10k) and a similar effect on equity.
A 10% increase in SEK compared to the exchange rate at 31 December 2017 towards all other currencies will entail a change of profit for the year before tax of CHF 0k as the SEK Bond has been repaid during 2017 (2016: negative change of CHF 7.296k) and a similar effect on equity.
Capital management
The objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to yield return on investment to the shareholders and to create and maintain an optimal capital structure in order to reduce the costs of capital and maintain a basis of continued growth in the Group.

The Group's capital management is also partly governed by loan agreements which include requirements to financial ratios. These financial ratios are affected by the size ofthe capital, that a reduction will reduce the ratios.
Total capital makes upthe equity shown in the consolidated balance sheet.

Report on the Review
o f Financial statements to the Board o fDirectors o fJacob Holm & Sons AG
Basel
Introduction We have reviewed the accompanying financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity and notes) of Jacob Holm & Sons AG for the period ended 31 December 2017. The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of this finan cial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this financial statements based on our review.
Scope o fReview We conducted our review in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standard 910 and International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, "Review of interim financial information performed by the independent audi tor of the entity". A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of per sons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review proce dures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assur ance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accord ingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying financial statements have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
