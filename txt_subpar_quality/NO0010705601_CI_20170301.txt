CEO's sta te m en t
The main highlights for the fourth quarter were sustained high sales figures for our Norwegian operation and further strengthening of AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS's balance sheet.
Customer acquisition in Norway continues to be a key focus. Encouragingly, ice.net's sales of consumer mobile phone subscriptions in the fourth quarter have been retained at the solid level we saw throughout both the second and third quarter. Churn is down again to industry leading level following the migration process in the second and third quarter. All in all, we are very satisfied with the net growth in consumer mobile phone subscriptions in Norway.
Ahead of schedule, ice.net started to generate smartphone on-net data traffic in the fourth quarter, including in Drammen, Larvik, Oslo and Fredrikstad. Base stations covering approximately 40 percent of the population have now been prepared for on-net traffic. Going forward, customers will gradually be transferred from Telia's to ice.net's 4G-only network.
In the B2B segment, churn in the fourth quarter was above industry average following the migration process from Telia's to ice.net's network. Churn has improved but is still not satisfactory. However, we are looking ahead towards introducing new products and services in the B2B segment.
Our intent is to continue on the growth path in Norway - both in terms of customer acquisition and network infrastructure build-out. To facilitate this, AINMT Holdings AB granted in December a subordinated shareholder loan to AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS of NOK 400 million with an initial disbursement of NOK 200 million and the second NOK 200 million disbursed in 2017. This will strengthen our ability to grab a larger share of the Norwegian mobile phone market.

Fourth Quarter 2016 Quarterly report

Significant events during the fourth quarter
· On 28 December, following a fully subscribed NOK 800 million private placement and subsequent share issue in AINMT AS and AINMT Holdings AB, AINMT Holdings AB granted a subordinated shareholder loan to AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS. The purpose is to fund further growth ambitions in Norway - both in terms of customer acquisition and network infrastructure build-out. The shareholder loan has a cap of NOK 400 million with an initial disbursement of NOK 200 million, and runs with 10 percent interest. The loan is subordinated to AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS' high yield bond (ISIN: NO0010705601).
Significant events after the end of the period
· On 3 February 2017, ice.net in Norway announced that it in March would launch data roll-over for all mobile phone consumer customers. On 23 February, the offer was extended to B2B customers as well, effective from April. Ice.net was the first operator in Norway to introduce the roll over concept, which effectively allows customers to transfer any leftover data from their current bundle (up to a certain cap) to the following month.
· The remaining NOK 200 million of the NOK 400 shareholder loan granted in December 2016 was disbursed in 2017.

Net financial investments for the quarter amounted to NOK 99 (-) thousands.
