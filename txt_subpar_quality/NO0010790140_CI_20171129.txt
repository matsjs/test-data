Operational comments
Highlights from the quarter includes robust group revenues with higher project related costs. Group revenues of MNOK 179,0 for the quarter are in line with same period last year of MNOK 176,9. Assistance volume has been characterized by normal activity levels during the quarter in all geographic areas. Number of assistances for the quarter was 5 percent higher than same period last year with no significant new clients adding volume. Organic growth in Sweden and Denmark driving the increased volume, while Norway near same level as 3Q16.
The group average assistance gross margin for the third quarter is in line with 3Q16. Gross margins in Sweden affected negatively by the ongoing restructuring process, while gross margins in Norway and Denmark are both approximately 8 percent higher than 3Q16. EBITDA margins for the group are affected by the reorganization of the call center and higher other operating costs during the period.
The Viking call center in Spain was informally opened and operational as of 1 July. Currently Viking has 64 operating agents in place answering calls from Norway and Sweden. The call center operations during the quarter have improved steadily from previous operator and performance is now at satisfactory levels.
During the third quarter, Viking entered into a joint venture with Assistansbolaget AB. The ambition is to establish a strong platform from where to build a substantial subscription base in Norway, thus competing directly in the Norwegian retail market. The retail subscription product will be marketed as Viking Assistance in Norway and the first campaign of 250.000 DMs was distributed ultimo October.

Third quarter 2017 Quarterly report

Assistance volume in Sweden is up by 25 percent compared to same period last year. The growth is related to new clients, growth from existing partners and increased brand awareness in the Swedish direct market. Higher project- and assistance costs in Sweden are affecting the margins and the 3Q17 result. However, we expect performance to improve in line with increasing quality from call center and cost control activities in Spain, and as the accounting for the Swedish entities is fully reorganized.
Organizational changes during the quarter includes the appointment of a chief commercial officer with experience from the Nordic car manufacturer market and the internal recruitment of a new operations manager.
