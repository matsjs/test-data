Turnover and EBITDA
Unicare continues its revenue growth in Q2 2017 through organic growth and acquisitions. The turnover in Q2 2017 is NOK 362,3 million compared to NOK 319,5 million in Q2 2016, affected by the acquisition of the two rehabilitation companies Jeløya Kurbad AS and Steffensrud Rehabiliteringssenter AS acquired in March.
Q2 was expected to be a strong quarter. The revenue model and customer contracts for most Unicare units result in a steady turnover flow throughout the year. Steady turnover combined with reduced salary costs in June, contributes to a strong EBITDA in June and as such a strong Q2. The low

salary costs in June is due to the payment of accrued vacation salary. Most of the groups full year EBITDA is generated in this quarter.
M&A
During Q2 2017 Unicare Holding AS signed SPA's for two new rehabilitation centres. Bakke Senter for Mestring og Rehabilitering AS and Landaasen AS which will become part of Unicare in September 2017.

YTD the profitability in Unicare's largest units Nursing homes (36% of turnover) and Rehabilitation (23%) is either according to, or greater than budgeted.
