Summary

 Despite significant operational/technical challenges in the early life of Breagh, performance since Q4 2014 has been excellent and fracking is the key to unlocking Breagh's full potential

 From late 2014 until announcement of Ineos' acquisition of the Dea UK assets from L1 on 11 October 2015, Sterling's ability to refinance, to sell/merge the company or to sell part of Breagh had been severely impacted by uncertainty about the future ownership of the remaining 70% of Breagh and operatorship

 To improve its financial position, Sterling sold its Romanian business for $32.5 million net cash in August 2015, is exiting exploration assets and has cut G&A costs significantly

 As of the date of this presentation, Sterling has paid all instalments and interest payments due under the Bond Agreement (which had not changed as a result of the two sets of amendments in December 2014 and May 2015)

 Resolution of the ownership of the remaining 70% of Breagh (and operatorship) is highly positive news:
- it enables realization of the full value of Breagh - makes a refinancing or sale/merger transaction more likely - reduces Sterling UK's credit risk

 Sterling now needs a few more months to complete the ongoing processes for a refinancing, a corporate sale/merger or an asset sale; all of which would result in full bond prepayment (including 7.5% redemption premium)

 The proposed further bond amendments should afford Sterling sufficient time and leeway to conclude a transaction resulting in full bond prepayment to occur by end February 2016

Background to Sterling's financial challenges

 Since the $225m STRE01PRO bond issue in April 2013, Sterling has experienced several challenges which have impacted both past and near term cash flow:
- Delayed production start-up as well as several production disruptions during commissioning and ramp-up phases - Lower than expected production rates from several wells causing lower overall production - Unplanned work and higher capex related to completion of Breagh infrastructure, plus increased capex due to fracking of wells and future
drilling and hydraulic fracturing of additional wells - Lower than forecasted UK gas prices - Delayed start-up and significantly reduced forecast production at Cladhan

 While the Breagh-related challenges are now overcome, the historic issues have impacted Sterling's ability to service its debt obligations
- Sterling's cash position at end Q3 15 was $18m, compared to a forecast of ca. $250m at the time of the STRE01PRO bond issue (based on production and gas price assumptions at that time; it did not reflect $32.5m net cash receipt from Romanian sale)
- Breagh is entering a two year investment period during which the field is forecasted to generate only a small cash surplus of $28m from Q4 2015 to Q3 2017 inclusive (at forward curve pricing), leaving very little available funds for debt service

 To strengthen short term liquidity, to give the company more time to sell assets and to refinance or sell/merge the company, Sterling and the Bond Trustee amended the bond agreement in December 2014 and May 2015
- Since the amendment in May 2015, Sterling has completed the sale of its Romanian operations with net proceeds used to pay the outstanding instalment from April 2015 and to pre-fund the DSRA

 As of the date of this presentation, Sterling has paid all instalments and interest payments due under the Bond Agreement (which had not changed as a result of the two sets of amendments)

Sterling has reshaped its strategy, cost base and asset portfolio

STERLING RESOURCES

 To assist in meeting its Bond obligations, Sterling has initiated several measures across its strategy, asset portfolio and organization
- Measures initiated in 2014 and expected to yield full effect from H2 2015 onwards - Sterling has reshaped to become a UK production-focused company with a lean cost base and limited E&A exposure
 Strategic shift:
- Focus on UK North Sea production and exit Romania, France and UK exploration assets; Netherlands contingent resources to be monetized as quickly as possible for limited further investment
- Achieve long term financial stability by refinancing debt and strengthening balance sheet; cost reduction and rigorous cost control - Sell or merge the company if this is in the best interests of Sterling and maximizes value - Longer term, achieve sustainable scale or sell company
 Sterling has recently completed the sale of its Romanian operations for $42.5m ($32.5m net after Gemini payment)
- Completion of the Romanian sale funded payment of the deferred April 2015 instalment, significantly reduced commitments and enables Sterling to negotiate a corporate/asset sale transaction or refinancing from a stronger negotiating position
 Sterling has aggressively cut costs in 2015 to adapt to its financial situation and lower commodity price environment
- Organizational review has resulted in reduction of UK employee headcount by 40% - No annual salary increases or cash bonuses for 2014 to be paid to staff in 2015 - UK offices in Aberdeen and London being relocated with aggregate saving of $0.5m pa - Expected $8.5m gross/$6.5m net annual G&A from 2016 (also reflects sale of Romania); down from $19m gross/$11m net in 2014 (lower recoveries and
allocations because of loss of operated assets in Romania and lower levels of licence activity) - Longer term, G&A could be reduced again from 2017

LetterOne/Dea UK history

Sterling has been heavily impacted by the L1/Dea UK ownership uncertainty:
 In March 2014, LetterOne Holdings S.A. announced the acquisition of RWE DEA AG (the entire upstream business of RWE AG, with operations principally in Germany, UK, Norway and Egypt) completed in March 2015 for 5.1 billion ($7.1 billion)
 In September 2014, it was reported that RWE lacked a 'comfort letter' from the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change ("DECC"), which was at the time a prerequisite for closing the sale
 Immediately prior to the sale completing in March 2015, DECC announced that it would require L1 to sell DEA UK, the UK upstream business
- Stated reason that the Secretary of State was concerned about impact of possible future sanctions on L1 (which has Russian shareholders)
 On 20 April 2015 DECC announced that the Secretary of State had notified L1 that the sale had to be completed within three months, with a possible extension to six months
 On 11 October 2015, Ineos announced the purchase of DEA UK from L1
- Ineos is a private Swiss-based chemicals company which has an existing onshore UK E&P business - Acquisition price not announced, but widely reported in media to be approx. $750 million (with L1's target price being $1.2 billion) - Ineos is hopeful that the deal will complete "later in 2015" post EC competition clearance; Sterling believes around end Nove mber is realistic - The DEA UK portfolio is dominated by its 70% operated interest in Breagh; it also has 50% of Clipper South and most remaining assets are
smaller late life/mature producing fields with material decommissioning liabilities and negative value
 On 28 October 2015, Ineos announced the purchase of a further 25% interest in the Clipper South field from Fairfield Energy

Resolution of the ownership of 70% of Breagh (and operatorship) is very positive - it makes a refinancing or sale/merger more likely and reduces Sterling UK's credit risk

Current financial/M&A situation

 Despite intensive efforts and many parallel refinancing/M&A processes, Sterling has not yet succeeded with any refinancing, asset or corporate sale principally due to impact of L1/Dea UK situation
- RBL banks would essentially only lend against existing 8 wells until new operator known (and acceptable to banks) and a recommitment to incremental investment programme made by the new operator - this had meant indicative RBL size was below $100 million
- Instead, Sterling would have needed to pursue a more difficult and higher cost refinancing, also subject to significant execution risk
- Despite receiving several offers and several more expressions of interest in both corporate and asset transactions during September, it was clear to Sterling and Jefferies International (as Sterling's adviser) that the lack of resolution of the L1 situation was deterring many potential bidders and significantly reducing the offered (or indicative) price
- Sterling has received several indicative financing, takeover, merger and investment offers and expressions of interest but all with many conditions and subject to significant execution risk and onerous terms as a result largely of L1/Dea UK uncertainty

 Sterling is currently unable to satisfy its obligations under the bond agreement at end October 2015
- Sterling is short of approx. $20m of funds to meet the US$32.3m payment to bondholders on 30 October 2015 ($22.5m instalment + $1.7m instalment premium + $8.1m interest) and to satisfy the step-up of minimum UK unrestricted cash to $10m
- First potential default would arise on 28 October, when the DSRA needs to be funded to make the payment on 30 October

 Total net cash flow from Breagh over the next ca. 5 years is sufficient to repay the Bond and all remaining interest (with step up to 14% coupon from November 2015 and including 14% interest on declining balance after formal bond maturity in April 2019)

 Sterling's principal bond-related financial challenge remains the shape of the amortization profile, not value-backing

Cash flow outlook
Free cash flow pre and post debt service(1,2'123)
USD$m
28 October 2015

 Excluding debt service (interest costs and scheduled instalments), Sterling expects to have a nearly neutral free cash flow over the next two years
- Material investments at Breagh largely offset revenue, leaving marginally positive free cash flow until mid 2017
- Limited spending outside Breagh, largely related to G&A at $6.5m/year in 2016 and notionally halved thereafter (to reflect focus on debt repayment)
- Marginal contribution from Cladhan following first production in Q4 2015
- Material positive cash flow is expected following completion of Breagh investment program in mid 2017
- Long-term cash flow generator until beyond 2030

 Second chart shows theoretical cash balance post debt service (per existing bond terms)
- Cash balance returns to zero H2 2020

October 2015 amendment proposal

Bond amendments:
 Deferral of the amortization instalment (including premium) due on 30 October 2015 (the "October 2015 Instalment"), until 29 February 2016 at the latest but earlier if triggered by the failure to achieve certain Milestones (as defined below) or in the event of certain other events of default
 The requirement to make monthly transfers of funds into the Debt Service Retention Account permanently deleted (this represents a continuation of the current suspension which has been in place since October 30, 2014)
 Revisions to the minimum UK liquidity requirement as follows: (i) from October 30, 2015 to and including November 29, 2015, $5 million (ii) from November 30, 2015 to and including February 28, 2016, $7.5 million (iii) from and including February 29, 2016 and onwards, $10 million
 A series of milestones on different dates ("Milestones") whereby (i) Sterling UK shall report to the Bond Trustee and its advisers, and (subject to a confidentiality agreement) Bondholders, on a shortlist of Transactions; (ii) approval of the Transaction shortlist shall be obtained from the Bond Trustee; (iii) Sterling UK shall report further on the specific Transaction(s) which it intends to pursue to achieve the Targeted Bond Redemption; and (iv) regular repeated certification shall be made relating to the expected completion of the Targeted Bond Redemption via the specific Transaction(s)
 If at any time the Bond Trustee considers, acting reasonably, that none of the Transactions or any combination thereof, has a reasonable prospect of resulting in a bond redemption, it may serve notice to that effect upon Sterling UK which could trigger early payment of the October 2015 Instalment
 Certain additional information covenants (to which further events of default are linked)
 Appointment of an Independent Director to the board of directors of Sterling and Sterling UK, as nominated by the Bond Trustee (in the case of Sterling, subject inter alia to TSXV approval)

Breagh: capex update

 Sterling has updated its 2P capex profile since the RPS Mid-2015 Breagh Report, to reflect cash timing of expenditures, revised well and compression costs, and revised well and compression timings
 Key assumptions:
- Both RPS Mid-2015 and Sterling current cases assume 12 wells plus 2 fracs of existing wells - Drilling rig now assumed to spud A09 in January 2016; expected on-stream in July 2016 (RPS: August) - Wells will now be sequentially fracked rather than batch fracked (RPS assumed A09, A10 and 1 existing well fracked in first batch; A11, A12
and another existing well fracked in second batch) - All 12 wells (and 2 fracs of existing wells) now forecast on-stream in August 2017 (RPS: May 2017) - Earlier production from A09 coupled with lower than expected decline rates from existing wells will partially offset slippage in rig timing - Phase 2 pre-sanction costs are an additional $2m net to Sterling

Significant value in tax losses

 Issuer has very significant UK tax losses
- As of 31 December 2014: 433m ($673m) (RFCT) loss(1) and 397m ($616m) (SCT) loss(1)
- Ring Fence Exploration Supplement increases tax loss base by 10% p.a., still available to claim for 2015
- No UK tax expected to be paid based on forward curve price assumptions and management expenditure estimates(2)
- Net Present Value of full existing tax losses, including future RFES benefit, estimated by Sterling as $108m(2)
- Subject to anti-avoidance legislation, a purchaser of the UK company could theoretically realise close to full nominal value for Sterling's UK tax loss and sooner than is currently the case
 UK 2015 Budget introduced further tax incentives
- SCT rate reduced to 20% (from 32%) from 1 January 2015
- Extended RFES for losses incurred from 5 December 2013 for a further 4 years (benefit to Sterling expected to be marginal)
- Investment Allowance of 62.5% uplift on eligible expenditures for SCT purposes from 1 Jan 2015

STERLING RESOURCES

Production, Reserves and Resources
 Current production rates disclosed herein may not be indicative of long term performance or ultimate recovery. Such rates are not determinative of the future production rates of the relevant fields and do not reflect how the production from such fields will decline thereafter.
 Estimates of Reserves and Future Net Revenue have been made assuming the development of each property in respect of which the estimate is made will occur, without regard to the likely availability to the Company of funding required for that development.
 Possible Reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than Probable Reserves.
 Company Reserves totals are arithmetic aggregations of multiple estimates, which statistical principles indicate may be misleading as to volumes that may actually be recovered.
Readers should give particular attention to the estimates of individual classes of Reserves and appreciate the differing probabilities of recovery associated with each class under a specific set of economic conditions: A 90 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimated Proved Reserves (1P); A 50 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of the estimated Proved plus Probable Reserves (2P); and A 10 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered willequal or exceed thesum of the estimated Proved plus Probable plusPossible Reserves (3P).
 The estimates of Reserves and Future Net Revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of Reserves and Future Net Revenue for all properties, due to the effects of aggregation.
 Contingent Resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies. Contingencies may include factors such as economic, legal, environmental, political and regulatory matters or a lack of markets. It is also appropriate to classify as contingent resources the estimated discovered recoverable quantities associated with a project in the early evaluation stage. There is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.
 The P(50) or 2C Contingent Resources quantity is considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be recovered. If probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a 50 percent probability P(50) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate.
 Prospective resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an associated chance of discovery and a chance of development. There is no certainty that any portion of the resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.
 In relation to the relative uncertainty of recoverability of resources, a Best Estimate resources quantity is considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. There should be at least a 50 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.
 MMboe numbers may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf : 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the volume ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.

Production, Reserves and Resources (continued)
 Certain information in this presentation may constitute "analogous information" as defined in National Instrument 51-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities ("NI 51-101"), including, but not limited to, discoveries in the same block in which the Company has an interest in the Netherlands. Such information has been obtained from government sources, regulatory agencies or other industry participants. The Company's management believes the information is relevant as it helps to define the reservoir characteristics and the reserves and production potential in which the Company holds an interest. Such information has not been prepared in accordance with NI 51-101. The Company is also unable to confirm that the analogous information was prepared by a qualified reserves evaluator or auditor. Such information is not an estimate of the resources attributable to the acreage held or to be held by the Company and there is no certainty that the reservoir data, resource estimates, production and decline rates and economics information for the acreage held by the Company will be similar to the information presented herein. The reader is cautioned that the data relied upon by the Company may be in error and/or may prove not be analogous to the acreage be held by the Company.

Information Sources Information on reserves and resources in this presentation are drawn from (i) the Company's most recent Statement of Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information on Form 51-101 F1 for the year ended December 31, 2014 ("End-2014 NI 51-101 F1"), (ii) the Company's AIF; (iii) the RPS Energy report "Executive Summary Report Reserves Evaluation for the Breagh Gas Field Quad 42 UK North Sea as at June 30, 2014"; and (iv) the RPS Energy report "Executive Summary Reserves and Resources Evaluation for the Cladhan Oil Field Quad 210 License Blocks UK North Sea as at December 31, 2014"; available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
