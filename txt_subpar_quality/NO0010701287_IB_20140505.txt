Outlook for 2014 StormGeo made a transformational transaction in February 2014, when it acquired US based company Applied Weather Technology Inc, (AWT). Following the transaction StormGeo became a giobal leading supplier of software systems, decision support and weather predictions. The acquisition propels StormGeo into a leading position within decision support for weather sensitive operations in the shipping and offshore industries, AWT, headquartered in Silicon Valley, California, has 11 offices in 7 Countries. They have been a leader in marine forecasting for over 15 years, supporting more than 5,300 ships per day with routing guidance and operational efficiency.

Annual Report 2013
Risk Factors Economic, Political and Legal Risk: The Group's business is diversified both geographically and by industries served. Still, StormGeo is exposed to the economic cycle and macro economical fluctuations, as changes in the general economic situation could affect demand for StormGeo's products and pricing of services. Changes In legislation and fiscal framework governing the activities of StormGeo in specific countries could have material impact on StormGeo's operations and financial results for those areas; StormGeo may be exposed to legal claims from authorities, customers or other third parties. No assurance can be given regarding the outcome of any such claim. In addition to insurance coverage, liability limitations versus customers are governed in the individual contracts.
Market Risk: The demand for StormGeo's products will depend inter alia on the conditions in the relevant industry. For example, a lower oil price may lead to less exploration activity worldwide and hence over time reduce the size of the market in this industry. If the quality of StormGeo's products does not meet market expectations this may adversely affect the demand, Prices may come under increased pressure and new regulatory requirements may adversely affect the demand for StormGeo's services. Still, as the services of StormGeo are focusing on the customers management of risk, most regulatory changes are overall more likely to be positive than negative.
Financial Risk: Changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates may affect the profitability of StormGeo's operations and the value of an investor's investment. StormGeo may be required to make substantial capital expenditure for expansion/development of its operations in the future. Such capital expenditures could be covered by revenues, new equity or by obtaining new debt, If StormGeo's revenues decline, or if StormGeo is unable to attract investors to increase the Group's equity, or if new debt arrangements are not accessible, or only on unattractive commercial terms, StormGeo will experience a limited ability to expand/develop its business and may also be prevented from paying its debts as they fall due. Failure by StormGeo to meet any covenants or undertakings in its debt arrangements could result in all outstanding amounts under the different debt arrangements becoming immediately due for payment.
Unsatisfactory economic management: Eventual Sack o f satisfactory economic management of the Group's liquidity, profitability etc, may result in failure to meet payments on time and ultimately may result in bankruptcy,
Competition: The industry Is highly competitive, and StormGeo faces the free competition between providers of decision supportto weather sensitive operations in the different markets the group operates, Most large business opportunities will be tendered by minimum 3-4 key competitors. The competitive field varies by geographical area and the industrial sector. Although StormGeo considers itself to be well positioned in the market, integrating the customer's critical activities into its decision support solutions, no assurance can be given with regard to future competition.
Volatility of Prices due to market fluctuations: Any investment in StormGeo's debt is associated with an element of risk, and the price o f StormGeo's debt may be subject to significant fluctuations caused by a number of market factors, ultimately market interest

Note i Summary of significant accounting policies
The consolidated financial statements of StormGeo Holding AS and its subsidiaries (collectively/ the Group) for the year ended 31 December 2013 were authorized for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on April 10th, 2014,
StormGeo Holding AS is a limited company, incorporated in Norway, headquartered in Bergen, Address headquarter; Nordre Npstekaien 1, 5011 Bergen, Norway,
1.1 Basis for preparation of the annual accounts The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFR$) as endorsed by the EU.
For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with Norwegian generally accepted accounting principles (NGAAP). These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 are the first the Group has prepared in accordance with IFRS. Refer to Note 21 for information on how the Group adopted IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements are based on historical cost, with the exception of financial Instruments which are available for sale and recognized at fair value. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of uniform accounting principles for similar transactions and events under otherwise similar circumstances. The consolidated financial statements are presented in NOK and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (NOK000), except when otherwise indicated,
1.2 Functional currency and presentation currency The Group's presentation currency is NOK, This is also the parent company's functional currency, The statement of financial position figures of subsidiaries with a different functional currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period white the statement of comprehensive income figures are translated at the transaction exchange rate. The average exchange rates for the year are used as an approximation of the transaction exchange rate. If this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing bn the transaction dates, income and expenses are translated at the transaction date exchange rates, Exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income (wOCIff). When investments in foreign subsidiaries are sold, the accumulated translation differences relating to the subsidiary attributable to the equity holders of the parent are recognised in profit or loss.
1.3 Consolidation principles The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2013,
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement With the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has; Power over the investee (i,e, existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)

Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and, The ability to use its power over the investee to affect it returns When the Group has iess than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers ail relevant facts and circumstances In assessing whether It has power over an Investee, Including: The contractual arrangement with the other Vote holders of the investee Rights arising from other contractual arrangements The Group's voting rights and potential voting rights The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control, Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement of comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary*
Profit and loss and each component of other comprehensive Income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and the non-contro|ling interests, even If this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group's accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows
relating to intra-group transactions are eliminated In full on consolidation.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, Is accounted for as ah equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, It:
Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controliing interest Derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded in equity Recognises the fair value of the consideration received Recognises the fair value of any investment retained Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss Reclassifies the parent's share of components previously recognised In other comprehensive Income to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
1,4 The use of estimates and assessment of accounting policies when preparing the annual accounts
Estimates and assumptions The management has used estimates and assumptions that have affected assets, liabilities, incomes, expenses and information on potential liabilities, This particularly applies to impairment test of goodwill (see note 22) and capitalization of development costs (see 1,7 and note 4),

1.5 Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that transactions will generate future economic benefits that will flow to the company and the amount can be reliably estimated. Revenues are presented net of value added tax and discounts, The Group provides weather services 24/7 and bill customers on a running basis for the provided services, In some cases, company pre-charge and amortises the invoiced amounts over terms of the contract,
Dividend is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the shareholders' right to receive dividend has been determined by the general meeting. Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the costs, which It is intended to compensate, are expensed, Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset.
1.6 Income tax The tax expense consists of the tax payable and changes to deferred tax. Deferred tax liabiiities/tax assets are calculated on all differences between the book value and tax value of assets and liabilities, with the exception of; temporary differences linked to goodwill that are not tax deductible temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures When the Group controls when the temporary differences are to be reversed and this is hot expected to take place in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that the company will have a sufficient profit for tax purposes In subsequent periods to utilise the tax asset. The companies recognise previously unrecognised deferred tax assets to the extent it has become probable that the company can utilise the deferred tax asset, Similarly, the company will reduce a deferred tax asset to the extent that the company no longer regards it as probable that it can utilise the deferred tax asset.
Deferred tax and deferred tax assets are measured on the basis of the expected future tax rates applicable to the companies in the Group where temporary differences have arisen,
Deferred tax and deferred tax assets are recognised at their nominal value and classified as non-current asset investments (long-term liabilities) in the balance sheet. Taxes payable arid deferred taxes ate recognised directly in equity to the extent that they relate to equity transactions.

1.7 Research and development Expenses relating to research activities are recognised as expense in the statement of comprehensive income as they incur. Expenses relating to development activities are capitalised to the extent that the product or process is technically and commercially viable and the Group has sufficient resources to complete the development work. Expenses that are capitalised include the costs of materials, direct wage costs and a share of the directly attributable common expenses, Capitalised development costs are recognised at their cost minus accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful iife of the asset.
1.8 Tangible assets Tangible assets, are valued at their cost less accumulated depreciation and Impairment losses. When assets are sold or disposed of, the carrying amount is derecognised and any gain or loss is recognised in the Income statement, The cost of tangible non-current assets is the purchase price, including taxes/duties and costs directly linked to preparing the asset ready for its intended use, Costs incurred after the asset is in use, such as regular maintenance costs, are recognised in the income statement, while other costs that are expected to provide future financial benefits are capitalised.
The depreciation period and method are assessed each year, A residual value is estimated at each year-end, and changes to the estimated residual value are recognised as a change in an estimate.
Assets under construction are classified as non-current assets and recognised a t cost until the production or development process is completed. Assets under construction are not depreciated until the asset is taken into use.
When there is indication that the carrying amount of an tangible asset is higher than the asset's recoverable amount, the Group performs an impairment test on the asset. When the asset's recoverable amount is lower than the assets carrying amount, the asset is written down to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset' or cash-generating unit's (CGU) fair value less cost of disposal and its vaiue in use.
1.9 Leasing
Operating leases Leases for which most of the risk and return associated with the ownership of the asset have not been transferred to the Group are classified as operating leases. Lease payments are classified as operating costs and recognised in the statement of comprehensive income In a straight line during the contract period.

1,10 Intangible assets Intangible assets that have been acquired separately are carried at cost. The costs of intangible assets acquired through an acquisition are recognised at their acquisition date fair value. Capitalised intangible assets are recognised at cost less any amortisation and impairment Josses.
The economic life is either definite or indefinite. Intangible assets with a definite economic life are amortised over their economic life and tested for impairment if there are any indications that the asset is impaired. When the Group performs an impairment test, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. When the intangible asset's recoverable amount is lower than the assets carrying amount, the asset is written down to its recoverable amount, The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's or cash-generating unit's (CGU) fair value (ess cost of disposal and its value In use.
The amortisation method and period are assessed at least once a year. Changes to the amortisation method and/or period are accounted for as a change in estimate. Intangible assets with an indefinite economic life are tested for impairment at (east once a year, either individually or as a part of a cash-generating unit. Intangible assets with an indefinite economic life are not amortised. The economic iife is assessed annually with regard to whether the assumption of an indefinite economic life can be justified. If it cannot/ the change to a definite economic life is made prospectively.
1.11 Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition Is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at the acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirer's identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance With the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquire.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is remeasured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill is Initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controiiing interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the gain fs recognised In profit or loss,
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing/ goodwill acquired in a business combination tS/ from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination/ irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquire are assigned to those units.

Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance Is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash generating unit retained.
Interest in a joint venture A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing Of control of the arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The considerations made in determining joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries, The Group's investments in its joint venture are accounted for using the equity method.
The consolidated financial statements include joint ventures according to the equity method from the date when joint control is achieved and until joint control ceases. Under the equity method, the investment In a joint venturers initially recognised at cost, presented as a noncurrent asset on the face of the statement of financial position,
When the Group's share of a loss exceeds the Group's investment in an joint venture, the amount carried in the Group's statement of financial position is reduced to zero and further losses are not recognised unless the Groyp has an obligation to cover any such loss,
Upon loss of joint control, the Group measures and recognises its remaining investment at Its fair value, The difference between the carrying amount of the investment upon loss of joint control and the fair value of the remaining investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised In profit or loss. When the remaining investment constitutes significant influence, the Group continues to apply the equity method and does not remeasure the retained interest.
1.12 Financial instruments The Group has financial instruments within the scope of IAS 39 are classified in the following, categories: loans and receivables, available for sale and other liabilities. The group has no financial instruments in the fair value through profit or loss category. Financial assets with fixed or determinable cash flows that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables. All other financial assets are classified as being available for sale. Financial liabilities are classified as other liabilities,
Loans and receivables and other liabilities are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the instrument. Loans and receivables and other liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method.

Financial instruments that are classified as available for sale are recognised at their fair value. The gain or loss resulting from changes in the fair value of financial investments that are classified as available for sale is recognised in other comprehensive income until the investment is sold. When the investment is sold, the accumulated gain or loss on the financial instrument that has previously been recognised In other comprehensive income Is reversed and the gain or loss is recognised In the income statement.
1.13 Cash and cash equivalents Cash includes cash in hand and at bank, Cash equivalents are short-term liquid investments that can be immediately converted into a known amount of cash and have a maximum term to maturity of three months. In the statement of cash flows, the overdraft facility is stated minus the balance of cash and cash equivalents.
1.14 Equity
Equity and liabilities Financial instruments are classified as liabilities or equity in accordance with the underlying economical realities.
Interest, dividend, gains and losses relating to a financial instrument classified as a liability will be presented as an expense or income. Amounts distributed to holders of financial instruments that are classified as equity will be recorded directly in equity. Convertible bonds and similar instruments which contain both a liability and equity element are divided into two components when issued, and these are recognised separately as a liability or equity.
The Group has entered into a convertible loan agreement, which have been classified as equity from initial recognition. The agreement is classified as equity because the Group has the option to demand the loan converted into equity, and this agreement does not at any point of time give the Group a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to the counterparty.
Costs of equity transactions Transaction costs directly related to an equity transaction are recognised directly in equity after deducting tax expenses.
Other equity (a) Reserve This reserve contains the total net increase in the fair value of non-current assets that have been revalued at an amount which exceeds their cost. The reserve also contains total net changes in the fair value of financial instruments classified as available for sale until the Investment has been sold or it has been determined that the investment is of no value.

(b) Translation differences Translation differences arise in connection with exchange-rate differences of consolidated foreign entities.
Exchange-rate differences in monetary amounts (liabilities or receivables) which are in reality a part of a company's net investment in a foreign entity are also included as translation differences.
If a foreign entity is sold, the accumulated translation difference linked to the entity Is reversed and recognised irt the statement of comprehensive income in the same period as the gain or loss on the sale Is recognised.
1.15 Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans The Group have made contributions to local pension plans, These contributions have been made to the pension plan for part and full-time employees and equal 0-30% of the employee's salary. The pension premiums are charged to expenses as they are incurred.
Share based payments The group issued options to the former owner of a subsidiary. Options granted are equity settled. On the date of the grant the Group was not able to make a reliable estimate of the fair value of the options granted. The options have therefore been measured at their intrinsic value on each reporting date between grant date and settlement. At each reporting date during the vesting period the cumulative expense is determined as the intrinsic value of the award at that date multiplied by the expired portion of the vesting period, with all changes in the cumulative expense recognised in profit or loss as salary and personnel cost and in other paid-in capital, Social security tax on options Is recorded as a liability and is recognised over the estimated vesting period,
1.16 Provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has an obligation (legal or self-imposed) as a result of a previous event, it is probable (more likely than not) that a financial settlement will take place as a result of this obligation and the size of the amount can be measured reliably. If the effect is considerable, the provision is caiculated by discounting estimated future cash flows using a discount rate before tax that reflects the market's pricing of the time value of money and, if relevant, risks specifically finked to the obligation,
A provision for a guarantee is recognised when the underlying products or services are soid. The provision is based on historical information on guarantees and a weighting of possible outcomes according to the likelihood of their occurrence. Restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has approved a detailed, formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either started or been publicly announced.
Provisions for loss-making contracts are recognised when the Group's estimated revenues from a contract are tower than unavoidable costs which were incurred to meet the obligations pursuant to the contract.

1.17 Contingent liabilities and assets Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the annual accounts. Significant contingent liabilities are disclosed, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources is remote. Contingent assets are not recognised In the annual accounts but are disclosed if It Is probable that a benefit will be added to the Group.
1.18 Events after the reporting period New information on the company's financial position on the end of the reporting period which becomes known after the reporting period is recorded |n the annual accounts. Events after the reporting period that do not affect the company's financial position on the end of the reporting period but which will affect the company's financial position in the future are disclosed if significant.
1.19 Changes irt accounting policies and disclosures These financial statements, for the year ended 31 December 2013, are the first the Group has prepared in accordance with IFRS. For periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with Norwegian generally accepted accounting principle (NGAAP).
Changes from NGAAP into IFRS are listed in note X, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards,
Standards issued but not yet effective The group has not yet considered if IFRS 9 Financial Instrum entm \\ impact the financial statements. The mandatory effective date of IFRS 9 is not known, but Is expected to be January 1, 2018 at earliest.
Other issued standards and interpretations, that are not yet effective, are not applicable for the Group, and will not have an impact on the financial statements. IFRS 1 0 , li and 12 have been early adopted upon transition to IFRS.

Note 17 Operating segments
For management purposes, the group is organized into business units based on the branches it operates, and has five reportable operating segments as follows:
The media segment, StormGeo weather services are custom-built to-fit all channels of communication; television, the internet, mobile (cell) phone or newspaper. We cover all levels of production - weather forecasting, technical solutions and presentation. Our main objective is to provide meteorological information to both commercial customers and the general public, informatively packaged according to each customer's specifications.
The renewables segment, StormGeo has specialised skills in translating meteorological data into parameters relevant to the energy industry. It is essential to interpret the weather accurately in order to describe and efficiently predict the effects of the weather and the climate on energy supply. Both the accuracy of the translation and calculations of parameters could be crucial for potential profit margins.
The offshore segment, StormGeo provides complete offshore forecasting services packages tailored to the requirements of our customers. Through our customised services, we cover offshore projects from beginning to end; from early planning through to the operational stages, and from broad long-term services to more short-term forecasting services particularly sensitive to changing weather conditions.
The shipping segment, within Shipping we provide the most experienced ship routing experts and our AWT Route Optimization System. Combining these with our enhanced weather forecast, StormGeo can assist clients with all of routing and marine forecasting needs. For both owners and charterers, StormGeo promptly provides the highest quality unbiased performance report based on the charter party details.
The onshore segment, Weather is the number one cause of business disruption (source: Forrester Research). Business disruption means lost revenue and sagging; profits. Whether you want to be the last to close and first to open, have concerns about safety and regulatory compliance, need a plan for preparedness and pre-deployment to avoid supply chain interruption or avoid internal weather-watching inconsistencies rely on the most accurate information available to businesses. ImpactWeather and StormGeo, serve as your outsourced weather department.
The remaining of the Group's activities is shown in the "other/efi minations" column. The Group's administration costs and other shared costs are not allocated to segments. Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. The Group reports the monthly mamangement accounts to the BoD and Management. There are no differences in the nature of measurement methods used on segment level compared with the consolidated financial statements. Asset figures in tables below are according to IFRS and adjustments to IFRS are not shown in the effect of transition to IFRS.

Including in revenues arising from the direct sales of Metocean Portals of NOK 74.1 million (2012: 66.4 million) are revenues of approximately NOK 16 mill (2012 NOK 16 million) which arose from sales to the Group's largest customer.

Note 18 : Estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
Estimates and assumptions The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a materia! adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below, The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group, Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
Impairment of non-financial assets An impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds Its recoverable amount,, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and Its value in use. The fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arm's length for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow mode!. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset's performance of the CGU being tested, The recoverable amount Is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs, including a sensitivity analysts, are disclosed and further explained In Note 17.
Taxes Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income, Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The Group establishes provisions/ based on reasonable estimates/ for possible consequences of audits by the tax authorities of the respective counties in which It operates, The amount of such provisions Is based on various factors, such as experience of previous taxaudits and differing Interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority .Such differences of Interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the Group companies,

Development costs Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy. Initial capitalisation of costs Is based on management's judgement that technological and economical feasibility Is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according to an established project management model. In determining the amounts to be capitalised, management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of benefits.

Note 2Q: Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share are calculated as the ratio of the profit for the year that is due to the shareholders of the parent of divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding.
When calculating the diluted earnings per share, the profit that is attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the parent and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding are adjusted for all the dilution effects relating to convertible bonds and share options. The profit for the year attributable to the ordinary shareholders is adjusted for interest costs (after tax) relating to the convertible bonds. The ''denominator" takes account of ail the shares that can be received if debt is converted and all the share options that are "in-the-money" and can be exercised. In the calculations, convertible bonds and share options are assumed to have been converted/ exercised on the first date in the fiscal year. Convertible bonds and share options issued this year are assumed to be converted/ exercised at the date of issue/ grant date. The dilution effect on share options are calculated as the difference between average fair value in an active market and the sum of not recognised cost portion of the options. The dilution effect on convertible bonds are calculated as the difference between the reduction in the cost of borrowing and the number of potential shares issued, The Group has entered into a convertible loan agreement, which have been classified as equity from initial recognition as described in note 1, The interests on the convertible is not included on the proft for the year, and thus not adjusted in the calculation of dliluted earning per share.

A) Goodwill (IFRS 3 Business Combinations) The Group has chosen to implement IFRS 3 for all its acquisitions. As a result of this, it is in accordance with IFRS no longer permitted to amortise goodwill and goodwill is instead to be tested annually for impairment. This is different to NGAAP, according to which goodwill is assessed as an asset with a definite useful life and is amortised over its expected useful life financial lifetime,
B) Investments in associated companies and joint ventures The Group's interest in joint venture Shippersys has in accordance with IFRS been accounted for using the equity method whereas under local GAAP it was proportionally consolidated. AS- of 31.12.2012 Shippersys AB's only asset was a bank account where StormGeo's share was TNOK 420
C) Cash and cash equivalents The group has entered into a currency pool with their bank. Under IFRS the pool is presented net for the group, where in local GAAP the assets and liabilities was classified net per company in the Group.
D) The group has a convertible loan of approx. 42 MNOK that under NGAAP was recognized as a liability, and interests was expensed. Under IFRS, the convertible loan qualified to be treated as equity, and the accumulated interests has been treated as paid in capital.
G ) Deferred tax The various transitional adjustments lead to different temporary differences. According to the accounting policies in Note 1, the Group has to account for such differences. Deferred tax adjustments are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in retained earnings or a separate component of equity.
E) Foreign currency translation NGAAP does not have the term OCI and the Group recognised translation differences on foreign operations in other equity. Under IFRS translation differences are recorded under other comprehensive income.
F) 1st year's principal repayments on long-term debt (Note 11) was in NGAAP presented as long term liability. Under IFRS it is presented as a current liability
Statement of cash flows The transition from Local GAAP to IFRS has not had a material impact on the statement of cash flows.

Note 22: Impairment testing of goodwill

Recognised goodwill In the Group amounts to MNOK 194.6 as of 31.12,2013. Goodwill Is derived from the acquisition of StormGeo AS, ImpactWeather Inc and Met Consultancy FZ LLC

Goodwill is tested for Impairment by groups of cash-generating units (CGU) equal to the defined operating segment In accordance with note 16 - Operating Segments.

Goodwill Is tested for impairment at least annually, or when there are indications of impairment. The impairment test was performed by StormGeo, The impairment test was performed as of year end 2013.

The recoverable amount is set to the estimated value in use. The value in use is the net present value of the estimated cash flow before tax, using a discount rate reflecting the timing of the cash flows and the expected risk.

The following assumptions were utilised when calculating value in use as of 2013

The value In use for Media has been calculated by using projected cash flows based on the budgets approved by the Group Management, main Shareholder and the Chairman, covering a five-year period, The projected cash flows are based on historical numbers and adding a moderate growth In the total market, consideration of focus areas, our market share and the prices of our products. According to the management this Is reasonable assumptions based on the development of new products and technologies.
The market has leveled off over the last year due to uncertainty among our customers related to changes In media piatforms/technology and consumer preferences following this. The online market Is expected to increase, but the business model for revenue generation will be subject to changes and Intense competition. The management expects a modest growth In the long run, primarily focusing In the broadcast segment where We have a strong partner and products. Due to much automated production, for all product categories, arid less work Intensive production, management believes that direct costs of production, installation and after sale activities will be reduced as a share of revenue generated.
Renewables
The calculation of the value in use for Renewables has been calculated by using projected cash flows based on the budgets approved by the Group Management, main Shareholder and the Chairman, covering a five-year period. The market situation for Renewables has been challenging the past years, and the tough competition and the postponement of Investments In new wind farm projects In particular has put pressure on the gross margins, Based on management's understanding and market analysis In the Industry, there Is a prudent optimism about the future, also outside Europe, and as such the calculations used has been based In a moderate growth In the total market and our market share. We expect a change in the product composition for the next years, capitalizing on the standardization of product deliveries, in particular towards the offshore wind market which utilizes the same product platform as for service deliveries to the offshore oil & gas segment, We also expect to grow In services to the electric utility segment, where the growth primarily wHI come from recurring products while the consulting business will have no or modest growth.
Offshore
The calculation of the value In use for Offshore has also been calculated by using projected cash flows based on the budgets approved by the Group Management, main Shareholder and the Chairman, covering a five-year period. The, development In the Offshore segment has been strong and the company also enjoys a good reputation in the market in all main basins. In addition we have a strong presence In most projects In the Arctic regions. Industry investments in regions with more harsh weather conditions, compliance to new environmental regulations, a general increase in the market, and the drive to improve management of risk, through more advanced solutions, are all factors management consider to be Strong drivers for growth In this segment. Management also expect to increase Investment in product areas to further benefit from these growth drivers. The company has a potential to take market shares as well by Increased presence in new regions, primarily In the APAC, but alsp in Africa and South America,

Onshore
As for the other segments the calculation of the value In use for Onshore has been calculated by using projected cash flows based on the budgets approved by the Group Management, main Shareholder and the Chairman, covering a five-year period. The Onshore In the United States segment represents a potentially large segment for the company. The market is characterized by several vendors, but no one having a holistic approach to the customer needs . The growth for our products and services has the last year by large been within onshore oil & gas, mostly delivering what already Is standard products with relatively little customization, The management have a positive outlook for the continuing growth in this sub-segment. The strategy for non oil & gas prospects will be changed and sales will primarily be made through direct mass marketing, with a general lower entry price than previously as well as almost entirely automated services, Expectations Is to later upsell based on this as well as still working the larger prospects with strong buying signals, in which each represents significant revenue.
Key assumptions for value in use calculations
The calculation of value in use for the cash generating units is most of ail sensitive when It comes to the following assumptions:
Discount interest The discount Interest Is based on weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and the Debt/Equlty ratio is estimated to 1.5 which is aligned with the new capital structure from early 2014, The cost of equity has been calculated with the basis in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Equity risk premium is set to 5% and is according to International studies. The cost of debt is estimated to 8% which should be lower than expected interest for the Group in the coming years. The total weigthed average costs of capital pre tax is estimated to be In the range of 11-13% for the mlsc, segments, see table below In next section, which are reflecting the current market rate of returns in the industries where the cash generating units are being Compared,
Gross margin The gross margin Is based on an average margin for the coming five years We expect a higher margin the coming years when we implement the global forecasting production platform in all 24/7 desks and streamline our product portefoiio. This is partly reflected in the estimates, there may be a need for subsequent adjustments.

Growth rate The growth rate in the period Is based on management's expectation to the development In the market In the rriisc, business segments and based on available information and knowledge about the marked management Is expecting some Increase in the growth for the next years. Management's expectation Is based on the historical development In trends and public sector analysis. As a consequence of the uncertainty In the expectations, there may be a need for subsequent adjustments.

Sensitivity analysis for key assumptions
Media
Goodwill within Media Is from acquisitions of StormGeo AS in 2011 and Met Consultancy in 2012 and the management believe that the purchase price was fair. The impairment test Indicated that the recoverable amount of the goodwill Is MNOK 57.7, which exceeds the book value with MNOK 48. The value is however based on several key assumptions. If these key assumptions are developing unfavourable it may cause a need for impairment of the recognised goodwill. If the growth is -0,3 % after the five year period, or If the margin Is reduced by 5.5 %, the CGU will be impaired If other assumptions are unchanged.
The table below shows how the recoverable amount of goodwill will be affected by changes in the various assumptions, given that the remainder of the assumptions are constant.

Assumptions Discount rate Growth rate after the 5-year period
Changes in margin

+/-1% +/- 0,5 % +/- 1%

Chanaes In recoverable +/- 7.9 MNOK +/- 3.3 MNOK

Renewables
Goodwill within Renewables: is from acquisitions of StormGeo AS in 2011 and ImpactWeather Inc In 2012 and the management believe that the purchase price was fair. The Impairment test indicated that the recoverable amount of the goodwill is MNOK 48.6, which exceeds the book value with MNOK 34.2. The value Is however based on several key assumptions. If these key assumptions are developing unfavourable It may cause a need for Impairment of the recognised goodwill. If the growth is -1,7 % after the five year period, or If the margin Is reduced by 4,5 %, the GGU will be Impaired If other assumptions are unchanged.

Chanaes In recoverable +/- 7.2 MNOK +/- 3.0 MNOK +/- 3.8 MNOK

Offshore and Onshore are not shown with sensitivity analysis since the recoverable values are significant higher than booked values. Management believes that no changes within a range of reasonably possible
changes will lead to that the book values exceeds the recoverable amounts.

Note 23: Financial instruments
Financial risk The Group uses financial instruments like bank foans, overdraft facility and shareholder loans, The purpose of the financial instruments is to raise capita! for investments necessary for Group operations and new acquisitions,
In addition the Group has financial instruments such as account receivables, accounts payables etc, which are directly linked to the daily operation.
The Group does not use financial instruments, including financial derivatives, for trading or hedging purposes, Guidelines for risk-management have been approved by the board and are carried out by the Group finance department in cooperation with the individual operational units.
The most significant financial risks for the Group are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, exchange rate risk and economic, political and legal risk. These risks and determines poflcies related to how Management continuously evaluates these risks are to be handled within the Group,
(i) Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk primarily related to accounts receivable and other current assets. The Group limits the exposure to credit risk with upfront and monthly invoicing and stops services if the clients does not pay outstanding invoices. The Group has low historical losses on accounts receivables. The Group has no significant credit risk linked to an individual customer or several customers that can be regarded as a group due to similarities In the credit risk.
The Group has guidelines for ensuring that sales are oniy made to customers that have not experienced any significant payment problems, and that outstanding amounts do not exceed
(ii) Market risk - Interest-rate risk
The Group Is exposed to interest-rate risk through Its funding activities (see note 11). Part of the interest bearing debt has floating interest rate conditions which makes the Group influenced by changes in the market rate. The Group evaluates this risk to be minimal as the USD loan value is relative low In the total balance sheet and the main loan from main Shareholder has a fixed rate.
(Hi) Economic, Political and Legal Risk The Company's business is diversified both geographically and by industries served. Still, Storm Geo is exposed to the economic cycle and macro economical fluctuations, since changes in the general economic situation could affect demand for Storm Geo's products and pricing of services. Changes in legislation and fiscal framework governing the activities of StormGeo in specific countries couid have materia! impact on StormGeo's operations and financial results for those areas.

In addition to Insurance coverage liability, limitation towards customers are governed in the Individual contracts.

(iv) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible,that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation. Unutilised credit opportunities are discussed in note 9
Surplus liquidity is primarily placed In bank accounts. The table below sets out the maturity profile of the Groups for financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments* When a counterparty has a choice of when an amount Is paid, the liability is included on the basis of the earliest date on which the entity can be required to pay. Financial liabilities that can be required to be repaid on demand are included in the "within! year" column,

The Group Is exposed to changes In the value of NOK relative to other currencies, due to production and sales operations In foreign entities with different functional currencies. The carrying amount of the Groups net investment in foreign entities varies with changes In the value of NOK compared to other currencies. The net Income of the Group is also affected by changes in exchange rates; as the profit and loss from foreign operations are translated into NOK using the weighted average exchange rate for the period.

Determination of fair value For the unquoted financial assets the fair value has been estimated using a the price offered to other shareholders late 2013 in Star Information Systems, where none of the existing shareholders accepted the offer and this Is equal to the investment value, For 2012 fair value has also been estimated to be equal to the investment.
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and overdraft facilities is approximately equal to fair value since these Instruments have a short term to maturity. Similarly, the carrying amount of trade receivables and trade payables, bank loan with floating interest rate is approximately equal to fair value since they are entered into on "normal" terms and conditions.
The fair value of loan from owners with fixed rate have been evaluated to be equal to fair value.

The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial Instruments by valuation technique;
Level i: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on
the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or Indirectly Level 3: Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair
value that are hot based on observable market data.
For recurring level 3 measurements, transfers between the levels in the fair value hierarchy are evaluated when reassessing the categories of the financial instruments at the end of the period.
