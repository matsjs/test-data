Cancel bondholdermeeting - Revised Proposal
FRN Golden Energy Offshore Service AS Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2014/2017 with ISIN NO 001 0711732 Reference is made to the Summons to Bondholder meeting to be held tomorrow 11 march 2016 at 13:00.
The Issuer has received feedback on the proposal from certain large Bondholders requiring some changes to the benefit of the Bondholders to support the Proposal. The Issuer has, to obtain support from the Bondholders, agreed to amend the Proposal against certain other changes. The Bondholders' Meeting is therefore cancelled and the Issuer will shortly make a new request to the Trustee to summon a new Bondholder Meeting. The Proposal will be amended as follows:
- Item 3(c) - changes to clause 10.2.1 (Call Option) is deleted from the Proposal and Clause 10.2.1 will remain unchanged.
- A new waiver is inserted:
"The Asset Cover Ratio covenant (Clause 13.6(a) Asset Cover Ratio) is waived until 30 December 2016. Next testing will be made against values at 31 December 2016."
- A new item will be included in the proposal as a condition precedent for the effectiveness of the changes:
"The changes and waiver to the Loan Agreement is subject to the Issuer by 29 April 2016 having redeemed a minimum of NOK 100 million of the Outstanding Bond as of 10 March 2016."
As stated above the Issuer expect a summons to a new Bondholders' Meeting to be published shortly.
