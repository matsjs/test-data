The publication of this Supplemental Information should not be regarded as an indication that the Ad Hoc Groups who received this Supplemental Information, the Company's management, or any other recipient of this Supplemental Information considered, or now considers, it to be a reliable statement of historical financial information or prediction of any future result.
Readers of the Supplemental Information are cautioned not to and should not rely on any information contained in the Supplemental Information, as the Supplemental Information was prepared solely for use in the negotiations between the Ad Hoc Groups and the Company. No representations have been or are being made to any member of the Ad Hoc Groups or otherwise regarding the Proposal, the Supplemental Information or any information contained therein.
