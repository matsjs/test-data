4. Evaluation of the Proposal
To enable the Borrower to conduct the proposed change of the Loan Agreement as described herein, the Borrower has requested the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' Meeting to consider the approval of the proposed change.
(a) The Borrower's evaluation of the Proposal
The De-merger of the Camo Tech group AS with subsidiaries is recommended by the board of Camo ASA for several reasons. The business of Camo Tech has a limited strategic value for Camo ASA, it is also very sensitive to changes in the business climate and is now losing money. Second, A Jasti has been willing to accept a high price for the unit compared to bench marking of similar businesses and he will also refrain from claiming compensation for potential tax claim from IRS on his shares in Camo ASA.
(b) The Loan Trustee's evaluation of the Proposal
The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.
It is recommended that the Bondholders consult with their own advisors to evaluate the consequences of the Proposal.

Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' Meeting. (If the Bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered.)
The individual Bondholder may authorise the Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Norsk Tillitsmann to vote, must then be returned to Norsk Tillitsmann in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' Meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to Norsk Tillitsmann, to notify Norsk Tillitsmann by telephone or by e-mail (at set out at the first page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.

Company Update in connection with a Bondholders' Meeting in the "10,5 % Camo ASA Senior Unsecured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2010 with warrants between" Camo ASA and Norsk Tillitsmaun ASA.
Introduction
The board of Camo ASA has now approved the audited Annual Report and Accounts and the de merger plan (the "De-merger Plan" or the "De-merger"). The Accounts and the De-merger Plan will be presented to the Annual General Meeting for approval in the Camo ASA offices at the 22,ldof May at 10:00 a.m. (Oslo time). The De- merger Plan has been registered in the Norwegian Official Registry, and both The Annual Report and Accounts and the plan has been distribute to Fondsmeglerforbundets info page and the Camo web page www.camouroup.coni.
The reasons for suggesting the De-merger can be summarized as follows:

o The Camo INC group of companies in the US consists of IT consultants doing temporary project work for IT vendors. The consultants of which the majority are ethnic Indians are working for Camo INC while they are waiting for Green Card (permanent working permit in the US). The business does not have a strategic value for Camo ASA.
o Mr. Ashwani Jasti founded the business in 1997 and merged it with Camo in 2001 and still heads the division. When the holding company moved to Norway in 2005 Mr. Jasti received Camo shares. The transaction in 2005 triggered a tax claim from IRS in the US. Mr. Jasti will potentially file a law suit against Camo if the De-merger is rejected by the AGM
o The Camo INC group is very sensitive to changes in the business climate, and is now losing money.
o The board has concluded that the prevailing gross value of USD 3,771,000 for the subsidiary is a good price in today's market. Mr. Jasti as founder and CEO of the group has been willing to pay a high price to regain control of his assets.

De-merger of the CAMO INC group
As a consequence of the De-merger Camo ASA will reduce its debt equity ratio to 23 % and be in breach of the covenant in the loan agreement of the abovementioned loan.
The terms and conditions of the De-merger agreement are as follows

o Mr. A. Jasti has established a Norwegian limited company which will hold 82 % of the shares in Camo INC (with subs). He will pay USD 3,771,000 by the redemption of his Camo ASA shares and retain USD 1,028,000 in debt of which USD 492,000 will be payable to CAMO ASA.
o Terms and conditions for repayment of the debt to Camo ASA and the 18 % shareholding in Camo INC are regulated in separate agreements between the parties.

A pro-forma De-merger balance is attached as Exhibit 2 hereto.

Exhibit 1
Operations
As can be seen in the Annual Report and Accounts, the financial year 2008 ended with NOK 114 mill in turnover compared to NOK 110 mill in 2007. Cash flow from operations was slightly negative on minus NOK 0.6 mill while net sources from a rights issue contributed NOK 3.7 mill giving a reduction in cash balance year end of NOK 3,2 mill after net investments of NOK 6,3 mill. Cash balance at year end for the group was NOK 4,7 mill.
Mr. S. Stange has taken over the CEO position in Camo ASA, CFO have left the group, while Mi-. Lars Osterberg has taken the position as MD of the Camo Software group. The focus of operation now is cost cutting and value creation in the two subsidiaries, Proteans and Camo Software.
Proteans has achieved USD 2.2 mill in sales and USD 540,000 in EBITDA for the first quarter of 2009 while Camo Software reached USD 461,000 in sales and lost 150,000 in EBITDA for the first quarter. Camo ASA admin costs are substantially reduced with effect from Q2.
Cash Flow, medium term financing
The proceeds from the rights issue at the end of 2008 of NOK 4.2 mill was not sufficient to cover the interest and installments falling due for payment at the end of the year of NOK 5.2 mill. The tight cash flow was temporary resolved by a shareholders loan of NOK 1.15 mill in February 2009 while a medium term solution must be found to ease the operational stress created by this situation and the worse than expected Q1 for the Software division.
Camo ASA has post the De-merger two remaining subsidiaries with good to excellent value creation potentials. The group will, during the course of the next 2 months, face two real alternatives to solve the cash flow situation:
° Sale of Proteans o A rights issue of shares in Camo ASA of NOK 5 mill
Alt 1. Sale of Proteans
During Q2-Q4 2008 there have been several interested potential buyers of the Proteans divisions approaching Camo. The board however did not consider the offers good enough and rejected the indications at the time. One of the potential buyers however have returned with an indicative offer of USD 8.5 mill (USD 7 mill in casli/bank guaranteed Pro-notes and USD 1-1.5 mill in "earn out"). The Camo board consider to pursue this alternative as a plan B.
Alt 2. Rights issue CAMO ASA.
If the bondholders and shareholders agree to the De-merger of the Camo Tech group the board will work to raise NOK 5 mill in new money during spring as a plan A. The funding is necessary to maintain full operational efficiency of the SW division and Proteasn and at the same time clean out overdue unpaid creditors in Camo ASA.
Summary
Post De-merger the debt equity ratio of Camo ASA consolidated balance is 23.1%. The breach of covenant has been addressed in the summons to a Bondholders' meeting dated May 7 2009.
One ofthc two above solutions for financing will have to be implemented within a period of 2 months fromUr of May. r
