Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Company may be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes.

The Notes will be senior obligations of the Company and will be guaranteed (the "Notes Guarantees") within 70 days of the Hurtigruten Tender Offer Settlement Date (as defined herein) on a senior secured basis by certain of the Company's subsidiaries (together, the "Guarantors").
As of the Issue Date, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be secured by firstranking security interests over substantially all of the assets of the Company and Silk Midco AS.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, counterparties to certain hedging obligations and holders of certain other future indebtedness will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the security in priority to holders of the Notes.

NOTICE TO INVESTORS
European Economic Area
This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of Notes will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive, as amended, as implemented in member states of the European Economic Area ("EEA"), from the requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes which are the subject of the Offering contemplated in this offering memorandum must only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Company, any of the Guarantors or the Initial Purchaser to produce a prospectus for such offer. None of the Company, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchaser has authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchaser, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this offering memorandum. The expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, including by Directive 2010/73/EU) of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 4, 2003 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading and amending Directive 2001/34/EC, and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Relevant Member State (as defined below).
In relation to each Member State of the EEA which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a "Relevant Member State"), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the "Relevant Implementation Date"), no offer of the Notes has been made to the public in that Relevant Member State, except that, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, an offer of the Notes may be made to the public in that Relevant Member State at any time to:
· "qualified investors," as defined in the Prospectus Directive;
· fewer than 150, natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors, as defined in the Prospectus Directive) in any Relevant Member State subject to obtaining the prior consent of the Company and Initial Purchaser; or
· in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,
provided that no such offer of Notes shall result in a requirement for the publication by the Company, any Guarantor or the Initial Purchaser of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.
For the purposes of this provision, the expression an "offer of Notes to the public" in relation to any Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes, as such expression may be varied in the Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State.
Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a Relevant Member State will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a "qualified investor" within the meaning of Article 2(1)(e) of the Prospectus Directive. The Company, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchaser and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement. Notwithstanding the above, a person who is not a qualified investor and who has notified the Initial Purchaser of such fact in writing may, with the consent of the Initial Purchaser, be permitted to subscribe for or purchase the Notes in the Offering.

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION
Financial Data
The Company was incorporated on September 1, 2014 for the purposes of facilitating the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions and the Refinancing Transactions, including issuing the Notes offered hereby. Consequently, no historical financial information relating to the Company is available. All historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum is of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries; accordingly, all references to "we," "us," "our" or the "Group" in respect of historical financial information in this offering memorandum are to Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In particular, this offering memorandum includes audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, prepared in accordance with IFRS, and accompanying notes; audited financial statements of Hurtigruten on a stand-alone basis as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, prepared and presented in accordance with simplified International Financial Reporting Standards pursuant to section 3-9, paragraph 5 of the Norwegian Accounting act, cf. regulation of January 21, 2008, and accompanying notes; and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014, prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards No. 34, Interim Financial Reporting ("IAS 34"), and accompanying notes. Hurtigruten's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014 are unaudited and all information contained in this offering memorandum with respect to those periods is also unaudited. All financial information presented herein, other than in the financial statements contained elsewhere in this offering memorandum, is in respect of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; the financial information with respect to Hurtigruten on a standalone basis appears only in the financial statements at the end of this offering memorandum.
Due to the changing nature of our continuing and discontinued operations in each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the discontinued operations in our audited consolidated financial statements for each of these years include different discontinued operations and therefore are not presented on the same basis. In the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 and in our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the comparative period financial information was changed in order to make it comparable with the current period presented. The financial information of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 disclosed in this offering memorandum have been derived from the comparative prior period information for the year ended December 31, 2011 included in the audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012; and the financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 disclosed in this offering memorandum have been derived from the comparative prior period information for the year ended December 31, 2012 included in the audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013. The financial information of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 disclosed in this offering memorandum have been derived from the comparative period information for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 included in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. As a result,
xii

the following businesses were classified as discontinued operations in the financial statements for the periods indicated with comparative balances revised to present the same discontinued operations as in the subsequent period:
· Consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014: Bus Business.
· Consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013: Bus Business.
· Consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012: Charter Business.
· Consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011: Fast Ferries Business. The Fast Ferries Business was reclassified as a continuing operation in the 2012 financial statements and the 2011 comparative balance was restated. The Fast Ferries Business no longer met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation even though we still intended to sell the Fast Ferries Business.
The original audit reports for the audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 were each issued on the statutory annual report in Norwegian containing the Board of Directors' report and reports on Corporate Social Responsibility and Corporate Governance, in addition to the financial statements both for Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries and Hurtigruten on a stand-alone basis.
Due to the changing nature of our continuing and discontinued operations in each of the years from 2008 to 2010, data relating to our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 disclosed in this offering memorandum are based on the comparative period information in our audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. In addition, the comparative period information for 2008 in our audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 reflects a change in our segmental reporting. This change in segmental reporting was not reflected in our financial statements for 2007 and accordingly, data relating to the growth of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment between the year ended December 31, 2007 and the year ended December 31, 2008 in this offering memorandum are based on our financial statements in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and not the comparative period information for 2007 and 2008 presented in the financial statements for the subsequent years.
The financial information presented herein for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 is derived by adding the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to the audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2013 and subtracting the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The summary financial information of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 presented herein is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or generally accepted accounting principles. It has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results for any future period or our financial condition at any such date.
The financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries included in this offering memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statements, balance sheet or cash flow statements that might occur as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the Hurtigruten Acquisition. The Company will account for the Hurtigruten Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS, which will affect the comparability of the Company's audited consolidated financial statements with the financial information contained in this offering memorandum. Under IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair value of any contingent consideration. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair market values at the Hurtigruten Tender Offer Settlement Date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the acquirer's share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In accordance with IFRS, we have up to twelve months from the Hurtigruten Tender Offer Settlement Date to finalize the allocation of the purchase price.

Our consolidated financial information is presented in Norwegian kroner.
Rounding adjustments have been made in calculating some of the financial and other information included in this offering memorandum. As a result, figures shown as totals in some tables and charts may not be exact arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them.
Other Financial Measures
Throughout this offering memorandum, we present certain non-IFRS financial measures and adjustments that are not presented in accordance with IFRS, or any other internationally accepted accounting principles, including EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted EBITDA margin, capital expenditure, Normalized capital expenditure, Normalized change in net working capital, Normalized profit margin, Normalized total revenues and Pro forma Normalized Adjusted EBITDA.
We have defined each of the following non-IFRS financial measures as follows:
"Capital expenditure" is purchases of property, plant and equipment and purchases of intangible assets for the relevant period.
"EBITDA" is profit/(loss) from continuing operations for the relevant period before the share of profit/(loss) of associates, net finance expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment (loss)/ reversal and income tax expense from continuing operations.
"Gross cruise costs" represents ship operating costs and selling, general and administrative expenses.
"Gross ticket revenues" represents ticket revenues, revenues from flights, hotels, transportation, food, beverage, shop and excursions as well as other passenger revenues, including car transportation, travel insurance and retained deposits in cases of cancellations.
"Net cruise costs" represents Gross cruise costs less commissions and costs of goods for flights, hotels, transportation, food, beverage, shop and excursions as well as other passenger services, including travel insurance.
"Net ticket revenues" represents Gross ticket revenues less commissions and costs of goods for flights, hotels, transportation, food, beverage, shop and excursions as well as other passenger services, including travel insurance.
"Normalized capital expenditure" is capital expenditure for the relevant period as adjusted to exclude capital expenditure for the relevant period relating to all Normalized Discontinued Operations and insurance proceeds received in connection with the fire in 2011 on MS Nordlys.
"Normalized change in net working capital" is change in net working capital for the relevant period as adjusted to exclude change in net working capital for the relevant period relating to all Normalized Discontinued Operations and the reversal of a receivable amount due to a ruling by the ESA which required us to pay back to the Norwegian government certain revenues recorded under the Former Coastal Service Contract.
"Normalized Adjusted EBITDA" is Normalized EBITDA for the relevant period adjusted for certain extraordinary charges, costs and non-cash items.
"Normalized Adjusted EBITDA margin" is Normalized Adjusted EBITDA divided by Normalized total revenue for the period.
"Normalized EBITDA" is EBITDA for the relevant period as adjusted to exclude EBITDA for the relevant period relating to all Normalized Discontinued Operations.
"Normalized profit margin" is profit/(loss) for the period divided by Normalized total revenues.
"Normalized total revenues" is total revenues for the relevant period as adjusted to exclude total revenues for the relevant period relating to all Normalized Discontinued Operations.
"Pro forma Normalized Adjusted EBITDA" is Normalized Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 as adjusted to (x) exclude the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations during that period, (y) include certain additional costs that we expect to incur on an on-going basis and (z) reflect the run-rate effects of cost saving and revenue generation initiatives that were commenced but not fully implemented during that period.
The normalized financial information that appears in this offering memorandum has been adjusted to exclude the results of operations, in each period, of all of our Discontinued Operations, in order to allow investors to compare our historical results of operations as they relate to our continuing operations as of September 30, 2014. As a result, the normalized financial information of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries in this offering memorandum excludes the following results in the periods indicated:
xiv

· Year ended December 31, 2011: excludes results relating to our Bus Business and Fast Ferries Business.
· Year ended December 31, 2012: excludes results relating to our Fast Ferries Business.
· Year ended December 31, 2013, the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2014: excludes results relating to our Fast Ferries Business and Charter Business.
We have presented these non-IFRS financial measures (i) as they are used by our management to monitor and report to our board members on our financial position for outstanding debt and available operating liquidity and (ii) to represent similar measures that are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of financial position, financial performance and liquidity. We believe these measures enhance the investor's understanding of our indebtedness and our ability to fund our ongoing operations, make capital expenditure and meet and service our obligations. We have also presented adjusted debt and pro forma interest expense measures, as we believe these measures more appropriately reflect to investors the financial position of and cost of debt to Hurtigruten in light of the Refinancing Transactions.
However, these non-IFRS financial measures are not measures of performance under IFRS, or other generally accepted accounting principles, and investors should not consider such items as an alternative to the historical financial position or other indicators of our cash flow, nor are such measures meant to be predictive of the company's future results. The non-IFRS financial measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as presented by other companies due to differences in the way our non-IFRS financial measures are calculated. The non-IFRS financial information contained in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC. Even though the non-IFRS financial measures are used by management to assess Hurtigruten's financial position and these types of measures are commonly used by investors, they have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our position or results as reported under IFRS. For example, some of the limitations of Normalized Adjusted EBITDA, Pro forma Normalized Adjusted EBITDA and other EBITDA-related measures include the following:
· they exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;
· they do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future;
· they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and
· they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our debts.
Operational Measures
Throughout this offering memorandum, we present certain key operational performance measures with respect to our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast and our MS Fram segments. We have defined each of the following operational measures as follows:
"Available passenger cruise nights" or "APCNs" is our measurement of capacity and represents the aggregate number of available berths on each of our ships (assuming double occupancy per cabin), multiplied by the number of operated days for the relevant ship for the period.
"Occupancy rate" represents our PCNs for the relevant period as a percentage of our APCNs for the period.
"Passenger cruise nights" or "PCNs" is our measurement of guest volume and represents the number of guests onboard our ships and the length of their stay.
Ship Valuation Data
In August 2014, V.Ships Leisure SAM ("V.Ships") prepared a valuation of our ships (the "Valuation Report"). V.Ships prepared a market valuation of each of our 10 owned ships based on estimated market value (the "Market Value") and an estimated replacement valuation (the "Replacement Value") of the following eight owned ships: MS Kong Harald, MS Nordkapp, MS Polarlys, MS Nordnorge, MS Finnmarken, MS Trollfjord, MS Midnatsol and MS Fram (together, the "Replacement Value Ships"). Due to the age of MS Lofoten and MS Vesterålen, which are our smallest two ships, a Replacement Value has not been provided for these owned ships.
xv

V.Ships has estimated an individual Market Value for each of our 10 owned ships. The Market Value of each ship is based on adjustments made to the certificates of valuation provided by Octagon Shipping, an independent ship broker (the "Broker Valuation"). These adjustments reflect a technical assessment made by V.Ships based on various factors, including V.Ships's assessment of:
· the build date of the ship, alternative usage and remaining life of the ship;
· the vessel type, navigation type and ice class of each ship;
· classification records of each ship and a physical assessment of selected ships;
· prior damage to the relevant ship (if any);
· the dry-docking schedule for the relevant ship; and
· the amount of capital expenditures estimated to be required for dry-docking, routine repair and maintenance and other expenses in relation to compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, including expenses in connection with the 305 Classification, that are expected to be required over the next five years for each ship.
The Broker Valuation of each ship has been adjusted to reflect the estimated market value of each ship after taking account of the specific characteristics of each ship and the expected capital expenditures required to comply with relevant regulations and to continue operation of the ship for its intended purpose.
V.Ships has estimated an individual Replacement Value for each of our eight Replacement Value Ships. The Replacement Value is based on V.Ship's estimate of current shipbuilding costs for building a similar ship as of the date of the Valuation Report based on amounts charged by certain European shipyards to build ships of similar size and purpose.
Although V.Ships has stated that they have sufficient current knowledge of the ship market and industry, and have the skills and understanding to undertake the valuations competently and consistent with normal industry practice, neither V.Ships, nor any person acting on V.Ships' behalf, makes any warranty, express or implied, or assumes any liability with respect to the reliance upon or use of any information or analysis disclosed in the Valuation Report. Any opinions or conclusions reached in the Valuation Report are dependent upon a number of assumptions and economic conditions that may or may not occur and a number of forward-looking estimates that may not be correct. In addition, the Valuation Report is based, in part, on information provided by third parties in relation to market values and estimated shipbuilding costs. You should not, and are not entitled to, rely upon the valuation taken from the Valuation Report and reported herein for the purposes of making, or refraining from making, any investment decision. V.Ships has agreed to the inclusion of these valuations only on the basis that you agree that you will use, or rely on, the reported valuations at your own risk and without recourse to V.Ships, who neither owe nor accept any duty to you in connection thereto and shall not be liable to you for any loss, damage, cost or expense of whatsoever nature which is caused by your use of, or reliance on, the reported valuations.
All conclusions presented in the Valuation Report are based on information available at the time of review. Changes in factors upon which the review was based could affect the reported conclusions. Forecasts are inherently uncertain because of events or combinations of events that cannot reasonably be foreseen, including the actions of governments, individuals, third parties and competitors. See "Forward Looking Statements." Data based on the Valuation Report that is included in this offering memorandum involves risks and uncertainties and is subject to change based on a variety of external factors, including those discussed in "Risk Factors."
The extracts from the Valuation Report shown within this document are presented for information purposes only by agreement with V.Ships on the assumption that no reliance may be placed on the Valuation Report or the summary information shown herein by any party other than the addressees of the Valuation Report.

INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA Unless otherwise indicated, statements in this offering memorandum regarding the market environment, market developments, growth rates, market trends and the competitive situation in the markets and segments in which we operate are based on data, statistical information, sector reports and third-party studies as well as on our own estimates. In drafting this offering memorandum, we used industry sources, including reports prepared by the Cruise Lines International Association ("CLIA"), Cruise Norway, V.Ships Leisure SAM, the World Tourism Organization, the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund ("IMF"), the Adventure Travel Trade Association and Cruise Industry News. To the extent that information was taken from third parties, such information has been accurately reproduced by us in this offering memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information published by these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. However, market studies and analyses are frequently based on information and assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct, and their methodology may be forward-looking and speculative. We have not verified the figures, market data and other information used by third parties in our studies, publications and financial information, or the external sources on which our estimates are based. We therefore assume no liability for and offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data from studies and third-party sources contained in this offering memorandum or for the accuracy of third-party data on which our estimates are based. This offering memorandum also contains estimates of market data and information derived from such data that cannot be obtained from publications by market research institutes or from other independent sources. Such information is partly based on our own market observations, the evaluation of industry information or internal assessments. We believe that our estimates of market data and the information we have derived from such data helps investors to better understand the industry in which we operate and our position within it. Our own estimates have not been checked or verified externally. While we assume that our own market observations are reliable, we give no warranty for the accuracy of our own estimates and the information derived from them. They may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from future studies conducted by market research institutes or other independent sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, such data involves risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" in this offering memorandum. As a result, neither we nor the Initial Purchaser make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such information in this offering memorandum.

SUMMARY
This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this offering memorandum and does not contain all the information that may be important to prospective investors and it is qualified in its entirety by the remainder of this offering memorandum. Prospective investors should carefully read this offering memorandum in its entirety, including the consolidated financial statements and interim consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, as well as the "Description of the Notes" and the other considerations in the Notes outlined under "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements."
Overview We are a cruise line, local transport, cargo shipment and exploration tourism operator centered around the
Norwegian coast as well as Polar waters. We have been providing our services along the Norwegian coast since 1893. Originally established to provide transportation services linking the south of Norway to the inaccessible parts of the north, the earliest Hurtigruten ships transported cargo and local passengers between ports. As a result of our long-established presence, public service origins and association with a long and naturally distinct coast line, we believe that we are one of Norway's most recognized brands.
Today, our business operations are divided into three product segments: Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast, MS Fram and Spitsbergen Travel.
Our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment is our largest segment, accounting for 84.9% of our total revenues from continuing operations in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. 11 of our 12 ships provide services along the Norwegian coast under this segment, making 34 northbound and 33 southbound daily departures from ports located between Bergen in the south and Kirkenes in the north. Freight and passenger transport remain an important part of our offering, which includes basic transport infrastructure, carrying cargo and local residents across shorter distances, and for which we receive a fixed fee from the Norwegian government each year under an exclusive contract that expires on December 31, 2019 (the "Coastal Service Contract"). We leverage this vessel schedule and infrastructure to offer distinct expedition based services and activities to leisure seekers through our cruise voyage products. The ships that we use to provide local transport services and cargo shipments are also used to offer exploration based voyages for leisure travelers, including a high proportion of international guests. Unlike the traditional cruise ships of the Mediterranean or the Caribbean, our ships operate as both "working" ships and "cruise" ships, all while showcasing Norwegian nature and local culture, which we believe is a differentiated offering compared to traditional cruise operators. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated NOK 744.5 million, or 20.8% of our total revenues, under the Coastal Service Contract.
Our second largest segment, the MS Fram segment, accounted for 9.7% of our total revenues from continuing operations in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 and consists of our MS Fram explorer ship, which takes our guests on distinct Polar voyages year-round in Antarctic, Spitsbergen and Greenland waters.
Our Spitsbergen Travel segment comprises our activities in Spitsbergen, where we operate three hotels as well as an equipment store and a host of tourist activities. This segment accounted for 5.5% of our total revenues from continuing operations in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.
Our Other segment comprises a number of non-core operations which have been discontinued. Therefore, we do not describe our Other segment in this offering memorandum; however, unless otherwise indicated, our historical financial data includes the results of our Other segment for the periods presented in this offering memorandum before such non-core operations were discontinued.

Our Strengths
Positive industry fundamentals in a growing market
Our business benefits from favorable underlying market drivers, including growth in the tourism market and the increased proportion of cruises in the overall tourism market, particularly in Europe, as well as the increased popularity of Norway as a cruise destination. According to CLIA, passenger volumes in the global cruise market grew at a CAGR of 5.5% per year from the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to a CAGR of 3.2% for the tourism industry as a whole during the same period, according to tourist arrivals data from the World Tourism Organization. The number of cruise passengers originating from Europe grew at a CAGR of 7.4% from the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2013, according to CLIA. The higher growth in the cruise market reflects the increasing proportion of cruises in the tourism market, especially in Europe. Based on cruise passenger data from CLIA and population data from the United Nations, the proportion of the European population taking a cruise holiday more than doubled between the year ended December 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2013, from 0.4% to 0.9%. We believe the potential for future growth can be illustrated by comparison to the North American market, where the proportion of the population taking a cruise holiday is higher than in Europe and is continuing to grow. In North America, the proportion of the population taking a cruise holiday increased by approximately 30% from 1.9% to 2.5% between the year ended December 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2013, based on cruise passenger data from CLIA and population data from the United Nations.
The increased popularity of Norway as a cruise destination is evidenced by the increased number of foreign cruise passengers visiting Norway, which grew at a CAGR of 10.2% from the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2013, according to Cruise Norway. We believe that this growth has been stimulated by the increased awareness of the Norwegian coast as a place of natural beauty, and therefore as an attractive destination for nature-based tourism and exploration.
As a long-established Norwegian transport infrastructure provider, we have been able to leverage our operating model to offer a distinct expedition experience and a wide range of land-based excursions and activities. We have maintained the public service component of our offering, while developing our offering of exploration based voyages on our smaller ships that offer more direct access to nature and interaction with local culture.
We believe that the nature of our offering differentiates us from conventional cruise operators and attracts travelers seeking adventure nature-based vacations and local cultural experiences, which we believe is an attractive segment of the market.
In addition, over 70% of our guests in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, were 50 years of age or older. As a result, we are positioned to benefit from the demographic trend of aging populations, particularly in Western Europe, which is a key customer market for us in terms of our existing client base.
Differentiated competitive positioning and high barriers to entry
We believe that our product offering is distinct from the offering provided by large cruise operators and is designed to target a customer segment not fully served by other operators. Rather than offering cruises to classic tourist spots on a "floating hotel" style cruise liner, we aim to provide our guests with an opportunity to visit areas of natural beauty and to experience local culture through "expedition" style voyages to more remote, natural Polar regions. Our main Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast offerings attempt to appeal to guests who prefer to be "closer to nature" and who value "authentic" Norwegian experiences over the experiences provided by conventional cruises. Our smaller ships can be more easily maneuvered and therefore allow us to get closer to the coast and the sites of natural beauty that our guests seek, and our itinerary of 34 port calls throughout Norway provides guests with an opportunity to interact with local culture and enjoy a wide range of land-based excursions and activities, including in remote parts of northern Norway.
2

In addition to our Norwegian coastal voyage offerings, our MS Fram segment offers the opportunity to travel on our purpose-built ship and participate in expeditions in remote Polar waters around Svalbard (an archipelago on the border of the Arctic Ocean and the Norwegian Sea), Greenland and Antarctica year-round. Our hotel operations in Svalbard offer guests opportunities to go dog-sledding, cross-country skiing, kayaking, snowmobiling, sample local foods and observe the Svalbard flora and fauna (including polar bears, walruses, seals and arctic birds). We believe these offerings appeal to our more adventurous guests, who are seeking to try new, exciting activities and experiences.
Our Hurtigruten brand, which the New York Times called "one of Norway's treasured national symbols," has been cultivated over our 120-year history and draws upon our Norwegian heritage, enhancing our credentials with customers seeking authentic Norwegian cruise experiences. We believe that our brand has high recognition in our key markets, such as the Nordic countries and Germany. We believe that, based on our strong brand recognition and authentic, adventurous product offering, a large proportion of our guests would not view a cruise with a large cruise operator as an alternative to our voyages.
Our competitive position is supported by high barriers to entry in the exploration and nature-based tourism markets, especially for cruises. We have invested a significant amount in our fleet of 12 small cruise ships, which are specially designed to serve our distinctive product offering. Any new entrant into our market, seeking to provide expedition and nature-based tourism services, would need to make substantial investments in similar small ships before it could compete with our product offering. Based on the current terms of our Coastal Service Contract, we believe a full fleet of 11 ships would be required to provide the services stipulated by the contract, and few industry players would have such a fleet, or our long established history and brand recognition.
Resilient revenues, EBITDA and cash flow generation Our Normalized total revenues and Normalized Adjusted EBITDA have increased over recent years, and we
had Normalized total revenues of NOK 2,859.5 million, NOK 3,262.6 million and NOK 3,303.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. In addition, we had Normalized Adjusted EBITDA of NOK 210.0 million, NOK 524.6 million and NOK 565.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013. In addition to benefiting from the underlying growth in the European and Norwegian cruise markets during this period, we believe that this resilience can be attributed to a number of factors, including the relative economic stability of the countries from which we draw most of our guests and the infrastructure-like qualities of the local transportation service provided under our Coastal Service Contract, under which we receive a fixed fee, regardless of passenger volumes, and which accounted for 20.8% of our Normalized total revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 and 11.4%, 19.0% and 23.0% of our Normalized total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

As illustrated above, the majority of our guests are 50 years of age or older and are based in a number of countries with generally strong economies, including Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States. As a result, we draw guests from a variety of countries and economies, and we are not reliant on any single economy to drive our business. In addition, the older demographic profile of our guests, who tend to be retired or semi-retired and have more stable spending power because of their fixed pensions and accumulated savings, means that our guests should tend to be less affected by periods of economic downturn.

We believe that our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment was more resilient during the recent economic downturn compared to select large cruise operators with operations in Norway, based on publicly available information of such competitors. During the period from 2007 to 2010, this segment only experienced a decline in revenues excluding revenues from the Former Coastal Service Contract ("non-contractual revenues") in one year. Specifically, non-contractual revenues generated by our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment increased by 3.2% in 2008 compared to 2007, decreased by 8.0% in 2009 compared to 2008 and increased by 4.2% in 2010 compared to 2009. The decline in non-contractual revenues for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment in 2009 compared to 2008 is attributable to a number of factors, including a 5% decrease in PCNs for our coastal voyage guests and a 10% decrease in PCNs for our port-to-port guests.

Our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast operating profit before depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 was NOK 227.7 million (resulting in a margin of 9.1% of Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment revenues), NOK 247.6 million (resulting in a margin of 10.8% of Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment revenues) and NOK 258.6 million (resulting in a margin of 10.9% of Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment revenues), respectively. Operating profit before depreciation for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment increased in the year ended December 31, 2009, despite a decline in revenue in that year, demonstrating resilience in this segment. Among other things, this was due to a significant reduction in certain operating costs in 2009, including a 5.1% decrease in payroll costs and an 11.7% decrease in certain other operating costs, including bunker fuel costs, which decreased during the recent economic downturn.

Since December 2012, we have been implementing a number of administrative and operational cost saving initiatives in connection with our Efficiency Improvement Program. Many of the measures we have implemented as part of the Efficiency Improvement Program have sought to streamline our operations and central functions in order to enhance our operational efficiency and profitability and to position us to achieve our growth strategies in the future. As a result, our Normalized total revenues and Normalized Adjusted EBITDA have consistently increased each year since 2011.

Revenue visibility
We accept bookings for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast and MS Fram segments up to 27 months in advance, and our Spitsbergen hotels accept reservations up to 30 months in advance. We typically require our guests to pay a non-refundable deposit ranging from 10% to 30% of the total amount payable at the time the booking is made. Our advanced customer bookings provide us with visibility into near term revenue across our business segments. Moreover, the payment of the non-refundable deposit reduces the risk of cancellation. The balance is typically payable 30 to 60 days in advance of the commencement of our product offering. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, 34.7% and 76.4% of our reservations for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast products and MS Fram products, respectively, were made six months or more in advance of the month of the departure date. As of December 31, 2014, our pre-bookings for the next twelve months in terms of PCNs for the Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment were 9.2% higher than our pre-bookings for the next twelve months for the Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment were as of December 31, 2013.

Well invested and fit for purpose asset base
We own 10 of the 12 ships we operate. The ships in our fleet were primarily built from the 1990s onwards and according to the Valuation Report prepared by V.Ships, our 10 owned ships have a combined estimated market value of approximately 292 million to 311 million and a total estimated replacement value of 750 million to 820 million as of August 2014. See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information--Ship Valuation Data." Our ships have between 10 and 35 years of working life remaining, except for our smallest ship, MS Lofoten, which we expect to continue to operate for the duration of the Coastal Service Contract. Our fleet is suitable for Polar waters and our expedition-based activities and the number, size and range of capabilities of our purpose-built ships operating along the Norwegian coast are well-suited to our business objectives and distinct offering, including delivering the services we provide under the Coastal Service Contract, thus strengthening our position as the incumbent operator under such government contract. Our ship, MS Fram, is purpose-built, specially designed and fitted for expedition voyages. Furthermore, based on our occupancy rate of 62.3% for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we have the potential to increase PCNs without incurring significant development capital expenditures. We also own the buildings and leasehold interests in the land with respect to our three hotels in Spitsbergen.

Qualified and experienced management team
Our CEO, Daniel Skjeldam, and his team successfully began a transformation of our business in 2012, which has since continued. Mr. Skjeldam was recently recognized for his efforts and was awarded Best leader in the travel industry in the Norwegian Grand Travel Awards 2015. Amongst other initiatives, members of our current management team have devised and implemented our Efficiency Improvement Program, which we introduced in December 2012. Since his appointment in October 2012, Mr. Skjeldam has continued to develop our management team with the appointment of, among others, Magnus Wrahme, our Senior Vice President Global Sales, in April 2013, who was subsequently appointed as our Chief Commercial Officer in April 2014 and Svein Taklo, our Chief Operational Officer and Senior Vice President of Maritime Operations, who was appointed in May 2014. In addition, during

5

2013, a number of new divisional managers were appointed to drive implementation of our new strategy and Efficiency Improvement Program. Our seven-person senior management team has a combined experience of 106 years in the tourism and maritime transportation sector industries and has a well-balanced mix of strategic leadership and organizational development expertise, industry experience and financial management skills. Our senior management team is supported by a strong team of operational managers. Drawing upon substantial operational and managerial expertise from within the cruise sector and other leisure sectors, our management team has realigned our strategy to focus on cost discipline and brand differentiation, positioning us for growth in the expedition market going forward.
Our Strategy
Our primary strategy is the profitable organic growth of our business, which we intend to achieve by focusing on the following strategic objectives:
Operational initiatives capturing substantial margin benefits
Our Normalized Adjusted EBITDA has increased by 27.6% from NOK 524.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to NOK 669.5 million in twelve months ended September 30, 2014. The ongoing implementation of our four-phase Efficiency Improvement Program since December 2012 has been a key driver underlying such increase. We have established a strong operational focus on cost control and have introduced a number of administrative and operational cost saving initiatives, which sought to streamline our operations and central functions in order to enhance our operational efficiency and profitability and to position us to be able to achieve our growth strategies in the future. For example, in order to reduce costs and drive margins in our key markets and regions, we have introduced a new cost-effective infrastructure by relocating our headquarters, centralizing various administrative functions, reorganizing our global sales and marketing offices and our Customer Reservation Call Center in Tallinn, divesting certain non-strategic assets and developing and upgrading our IT operating platforms. As a result of our Efficiency Improvement Program, our operational costs have declined substantially since 2012, and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we achieved total efficiency improvements of NOK 96.5 million in connection with the Efficiency Improvement Program.
In December 2013, we commenced the implementation of several new cost saving measures as part of phase four of our Efficiency Improvement Program. These initiatives include improved procurement processes, as well as measures designed to enhance our bunker fuel efficiency. The new procurement processes involve the introduction of a purchasing framework designed to align procurement contract pricing with prevalent, competitive market pricing for various procurement inputs. The bunker fuel efficiency measures primarily consist of cleaning the exterior of each of our ships to remove debris annually, which will reduce drag, as well as operating our ships at a more fuel efficient speed. In addition to the cost saving measures discussed above, we have also implemented a number of revenue generating measures including offering a wider selection of dining options including an à la carte menu in our restaurants, increasing the number of points of sale and suggesting room upgrades to passengers at the time of booking. Phase four of our Efficiency Improvement Program is expected to be fully implemented by mid-2015. We expect that the preliminary results of these initiatives will be reflected in our operating results for 2015 and the full effect will be reflected in our operating results for 2016.
Expand our customer base to drive revenue growth
We carried approximately 84,765 coastal voyage guests (guests travelling more than five nights) in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. We seek to increase occupancy rates by using our flexible pricing model to attract guests year round. A high proportion of our operating costs, particularly those which relate to the operation of our ships, are fixed. As a result, we are positioned to leverage our fixed cost base to increase profitability by increasing our utilization rates without a corresponding increase in our cost base. By optimizing excess capacity on board our ships, we can maximize our net revenues without substantial new investments. In recent years we have developed various seasonal concepts to complement our peak season theme, including, "Autumn Gold" in the fall, "Hunting the Light" in the winter and "Arctic Awakening" in the spring. We use such seasonal concepts to attract customers seeking a distinct travel and expedition experience that is only available during specific times of the year. Such specialty marketing campaigns and seasonal itineraries seek to expand our existing offering and to increase demand during non-peak seasons without incurring additional costs.
6

We also seek to expand the number of our guests through our marketing activities and to increase awareness of our distinct explorer based brand proposition. We are taking steps to achieve this by:
· continuing to seek new guests in non-European geographies, where there is demand for exploration style activities, such as through our new sales and marketing office in Seattle, Washington, which services North America and which we opened in January 2014;
· improving our marketing materials to appeal to customers, through emphasizing our explorer based brand proposition, the vast range of activities we offer and the distinct geographies in which we operate; and
· strengthening our position as a key player in the Norwegian tourism market by working with local travel, trade and government agencies to develop Norwegian tourism and market the country internationally. We plan to continue working with local travel, trade and government agencies to increase the number of direct international flights to coastal destinations in Norway in order to encourage growth in the short-break market and to make our products along the Norwegian coast more easily accessible.
Enhance our product offering
One of the key goals of our Efficiency Improvement Program has been to drive operational efficiencies in order to rationalize our expense base and also to prepare for future growth. We seek to enhance and expand our product offering and increase our number of guests through the following key initiatives:
· continuing to use our explorer brand proposition and mindset, particularly with respect to our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast business segment, in order to position our offerings in the niche Norwegian explorer leisure service industry. By marketing all of our voyages as explorer services, we intend to further distinguish ourselves from traditional cruise and hotel operators. We plan to achieve this by increasing the range of exploration and nature-based activities we offer;
· continuing to use our longstanding Norwegian heritage and brand to align our offerings to reflect our Norwegian identity. For example, we intend to continue to serve local food and provide nature and history based lectures onboard our ships;
· adding new voyage and expedition itineraries to expand our product offering and encourage repeat business;
· extending our existing operations to offer an extended range of expedition activities in new areas on an opportunistic basis. For example, we plan to introduce an expedition voyage exploring the area around Spitsbergen from June to August 2015, which combines a sea voyage with our existing hotel operations in order to expand our product offering and to attract customers through these new offerings;
· further developing our land-based activities such as local food tours, bird watching, Lapland (Sami) cultural tours and visits to land-based sights, including glaciers, the North Cape and city tours, and experience and activity-based products in Spitsbergen by focusing on year-round activities and experiences; and
· securing incremental revenue through add-on services and improving products and services offered onboard our ships to increase onboard revenues.
Further expansion of our e-commerce channels
We aim to reach our customers through our various e-commerce channels, including our websites, mobile platforms, search engine marketing, social media accounts and email communications. We operate seven country-specific versions and one global version of our website, and we have become increasingly focused on digital sales and marketing in recent years. We use our website to update customers and potential customers on our latest product offerings and promotions, and we have significantly increased our traffic to our website through search engine optimization and search engine marketing.
7

Over the course of 2015, we intend to launch a program for digitizing and streamlining our commercial processes in order to increase sales as well as to reduce our sales and distribution costs. Our aim is to increase our overall online sales through self-service solutions, both for travel agents and guests that book directly with us. The first stage of this e-commerce upgrade is expected to become operational during the second half of 2015 and will include a new website designed to increase interaction with users as well as more inspirational content to attract guests, and more effective booking functions. The second stage will introduce other improvements, including personal user profiles for every guest linked with our customer relation management system, which will enable us to directly provide our customers with targeted marketing materials, and enhanced functionality for offering various supplemental packages and additional services before, during and after a voyage. We intend to introduce mobile and tablet applications as part of our digital offering and a function allowing our port-to-port guests to book more quickly.
History
The coastline between Bergen and Kirkenes is over 2,400 kilometers long, and prior to the 1890's the communication between the south and north of Norway was limited, both on land and at sea. Maritime maps were unreliable, and there were only a few lighthouses established, especially in the north. It was essential for the Norwegian government to establish a safe trade and passenger route to link the southern and northern regions of Norway.
Established by Richard With, what is now known as Hurtigruten commenced its operations in 1893 by transporting mail, cargo, local passengers and international tourists along the Norwegian coast. To this day, our ships continue to carry cargo, but the proportion of passengers has steadily increased. We believe that for many locals, as well as being a means of transport, the ships are part of Norwegian tradition and culture. Historically, we established our operations based on public services through the transportation of cargo and provision of public transport. We have continued to provide such public services under our Coastal Service Contract and have used our geographic operations, ships and operating model to create what we believe is a distinct coastal voyage offering, by offering explorer and nature-based voyages to a largely international customer base. We continue to be a transport infrastructure provider, and we have expanded our operations to offer vacation and tourist services through our coastal voyage offering as part of our increasing focus on growing and developing our tourist based business.
A few years after commencing the Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast service in 1893, Richard With established an additional route from the North Cape to Spitsbergen, with the steam ship DS Lofoten. In 1896, he built Spitsbergen's first hotel in the Advent Fjord, thus taking the first steps towards introducing tourism to the mining and hunting population of Spitsbergen. We now provide these tourism services through our Spitsbergen Travel segment, established in 1988.
In 2002, we entered the expedition segment by offering trips to Antarctica. In 2007, our new purpose-built expedition ship, MS Fram, was completed and embarked on its maiden voyage to Greenland.
In 2006, two shipping companies operating under the Hurtigruten brand, Ofotens og Vesterålens Dampskipsselskab and Troms Fylkes Dampskipsselskab, merged to become Hurtigruten ASA.
In 2008 and 2009, we implemented some initial measures aimed at reducing our operating costs. We integrated our sales office and commenced the process of corporate reorganization. We also divested most of our ferry and fast ferry operations, including a fleet of 45 smaller fast ferries in order to re-focus on our core business of exploration travel and coastal voyages.
In 2009, our shareholder Periscopus initially invested in Hurtigruten. This was followed by an investment by our shareholder Home Capital in 2011.
In 2012 and 2013, our new CEO, Daniel Skjeldam and his team implemented new cost efficiency measures through the introduction of our Efficiency Improvement Program. The program involved the continued disposition of non-core assets, including our Fast Ferries Business and Bus Business.
In December 2014, Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries were acquired by our current shareholders as part of the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions. Following the issuance of the Notes, Hurtigruten will be delisted from the Oslo Stock Exchange and will cease to be a publicly traded company. See "--Recent Developments--The Hurtigruten Acquisition and the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions."

(3) On December 16, 2014, we borrowed approximately 133.7 million under the Bridge Facility in connection with the Hurtigruten Tender Offer and to pay certain financing fees. On January 14, 2015, we borrowed 282.4 million under the Bridge Facility in connection with the repayment and cancellation of the Former Financing Arrangements, to terminate our former interest rate swaps, foreign currency exchange swaps and the majority of our bunker fuel swaps as well as to pay certain financing fees. We borrowed an additional 38.9 million under the Bridge Facility on January 22, 2015, in connection with the redemption and discharge of the Former Notes and to pay certain financing fees. As set forth under "Use of Proceeds," the outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and any break costs, under the Bridge Facility will be repaid in full on the Issue Date with the proceeds of the Offering.
(4) On January 22, 2015 we borrowed NOK 250.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility for general working capital purposes, as the first calendar quarter is typically a low point in our cash cycle. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility replaced borrowings under our former revolving credit facility, which was repaid and will provide additional funds to cover the cash payments made in connection with the termination of our former interest rate swaps, foreign currency exchange swaps and the majority of our bunker fuel swaps.
(5) As part of the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions, the Former Facilities, including NOK 100.0 million of borrowings drawn under the former revolving credit facility during the three months ended December 31, 2014, plus break costs and accrued interest, were repaid in full and such Former Facilities were terminated and we also redeemed and discharged the Former Notes in full.

Following the issuance of the Notes, Hurtigruten will be delisted from the Oslo Stock Exchange and will cease to be a publicly traded company.
Trading Update Currently, we expect that revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 will be higher than revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, on a preliminary basis, we expect Normalized Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2014, to be slightly higher than Normalized Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.
Financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 are not yet finalized. The information above is based on certain preliminary financial data. Our actual consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2014 may differ from the foregoing preliminary estimates and expectations and remain subject to change. During the course of our audit and review process for the year ended December 31, 2014, we could identify items that would require us to make adjustments and which could affect our final results of operations. See "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" for a more complete discussion of certain factors that could affect our financial results and future performance. See also "Presentation of Financial and Other Information."
Guest Pre-bookings A significant amount of our revenues is attributable to pre-bookings by customers in advance of their trips and such pre-bookings are generally secured by a non-refundable cash deposit ranging from 10% to 30% of the total amount owed. We estimate that 51% of our total bookings for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast and MS Fram segments for the year ended December 31, 2014 had already been pre-booked as of December 31, 2013.
Given the propensity of customers to pre-book and the deterrent to subsequent cancellation as a result of the non-refundable deposit, we believe that we have a high degree of visibility of our revenues for the following twelve months.
We had bookings for the three months ended December 31, 2014 that were 5.0% above the corresponding period in 2013 and as of December 31, 2014, we had pre-bookings for the following nine months that were 5.1% higher than pre-bookings for the same period in the previous year (at December 31, 2014 Constant Exchange Rates, as defined below). Taken together, the increase in actual bookings from September 30, 2014 to December 31, 2014 and the increase in pre-bookings as of December 31, 2014 for the next nine month period to September 30, 2015 would have generated an additional NOK 92.4 million in revenues compared to the amount of bookings and pre-bookings for the same periods in 2013.
We estimate that this NOK 92.4 million in additional revenues would convert into EBITDA at a margin of 59.5% and therefore would account for an increase of NOK 55.0 million in EBITDA in the twelve months ending September 30, 2015.
10

We continue to observe a positive booking trend and as of December 31, 2014, our year-on-year customer pre-bookings for the next twelve months increased by 6.4% (at December 31, 2014 Constant Exchange Rates).
The above analysis has been prepared on the basis of the following assumptions:
· we have translated bookings and pre-bookings in foreign currencies into Norwegian kroner using the spot exchange rates for each of the euro, pound sterling and U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2014, as published by Bloomberg Generic Rate (1.00 = NOK 9.0162, £1.00 = NOK 11.6095 and $1.00 = NOK 7.4520) ("December 31, 2014 Constant Exchange Rates").
· in estimating the expected increase in revenue and EBITDA, we have not assumed any increase in bookings for the relevant future period to which the pre-bookings relate, compared to the prior corresponding period; and
· in estimating the expected increase in revenue, the percentage increase in bookings and pre-bookings is applied to our variable revenues for the prior corresponding period, which excludes fixed revenues, such as revenues under the Coastal Service Contract. Similarly, we have adjusted our variable costs in order to estimate the increase in EBITDA but have made no adjustments to our fixed costs.
We may experience an increase in cancellations or lower bookings during, and relating to, the nine month period to September 30, 2015 in comparison to the same period last year, and as a result we may not ultimately realize increased revenues or EBITDA as a result of our increased pre-bookings or any such increase may be significantly lower than the one indicated above. The figures presented above were derived from a calculation of our results of operations and exchange rates for a specific period of time; they are not intended to be representative of our actual operating results for any future period and any such results may vary widely from the calculations set forth above. The assumptions outlined above are not intended to be representative of currency exchange rates at any date other than the date indicated or of our results of operations at any time. In addition, the margin at which additional revenues attributable to increased pre-bookings are converted into EBITDA in the applicable period may vary significantly from the margin indicated above as a result of various factors, many of which are outside our control. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this pre-booking data. See "Forward Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" for a more complete discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance and results of operation.
Other Market Updates
Foreign Exchange Fluctuations
The euro, pound sterling and U.S. dollar each strengthened against the Norwegian kroner during the course of 2014, including during the three months ended December 31, 2014, with the euro exchange rate increasing from 1.00 = NOK 8.1162 as of September 30, 2014 to 1.00 = NOK 9.0162 as of December 31, 2014, the pound sterling increasing from £1.00 = NOK 10.4181 as of September 30, 2014 to £1.00 = NOK 11.6095 as of December 31, 2014 and the U.S. dollar increasing from $1.00 = NOK 6.4261 as of September 30, 2014 to $1.00 = NOK 7.4520 as of December 31, 2014.
As we typically generate a significant proportion of our revenues in non-NOK currencies, particularly euros, and we incur a significant portion of our costs in Norwegian kroner, a decline in the value of the Norwegian kroner (which is our reporting currency), against the euro, pound sterling and U.S. dollar would generally have a positive translation effect with respect to our revenues and results of operations, including EBITDA.
The table below provides a breakdown of the following measures for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, by the currency in which they are generated or incurred as a percentage of Operational Revenues (as defined below):
· revenues, excluding losses with respect to our former foreign currency exchange swaps that were realized in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, as well as unrealized effects with respect to foreign currency exchange swaps and foreign currency effects with respect to trade receivables during the same period ("Operational Revenues"); and
· payroll costs and other operating costs excluding bunker fuel costs (together, the "Operating Costs").

All other things remaining constant, assuming constant bunker fuel costs in Norwegian kroner and without giving effect to our foreign currency exchange swaps that were terminated as part of the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions, Normalized Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 would have increased by an aggregate of approximately NOK 158.9 million using the spot exchange rates for each of the euro, pound sterling and U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2014, as published by Bloomberg Generic Rate (1.00 = NOK 9.0162, £1.00 = NOK 11.6095 and $1.00 = NOK 7.4520), instead of the rates at which those currencies were translated into Norwegian kroner in our financial statements during the applicable period.

Bunker Fuel Fluctuations
Bunker fuel prices declined during the course of 2014, including during the three months ended December 31, 2014. A decrease in the price of bunker fuel, which represents one of our largest operating costs, would have a positive impact in reducing our costs.
According to Bloomberg's listing of futures contracts for Generic ICE Brent 1st Future crude oil, the price of Brent Crude Oil has decreased to $57.33 per barrel as of December 31, 2014 (NOK 427.2 per barrel), from an average price of $107.58 per barrel for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 (NOK 655.8 per barrel). Such prices are based on the daily closing price for Brent Crude Oil. The Company uses bunker fuel consisting of marine special distillate and marine gas oil for the operation of its ships and the price of these fuels is correlated to the price of Brent Crude Oil.
Historically, we have hedged a portion of our expected fuel usage in line with our quarterly rolling hedging policy. As part of the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions, we terminated the majority of our bunker fuel swaps on January 14, 2015 and we rolled over our remaining bunker fuel swaps covering approximately 4% of our expected bunker fuel consumption for 2015.
In the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we incurred bunker fuel costs of NOK 478.2 million, including NOx tax and costs related to our bunker fuel hedges. For every incremental decrease of $10 per barrel for crude oil (using an exchange rate of $1.00 = NOK 7.4520, which represents the spot exchange rate as of December 31, 2014, as published by Bloomberg Generic Rate), we would have saved approximately NOK 33.1 million in total bunker fuel costs for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, which would have resulted in an increase of NOK 33.1 million in Normalized Adjusted EBITDA for this period. Assuming the bunker fuel price as of December 31, 2014 had been the price of bunker fuel throughout the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, our bunker fuel costs would have decreased by approximately NOK 101.2 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, which would have resulted in an increase of NOK 101.2 million in Normalized Adjusted EBITDA for this period.
Both foreign exchange rates and bunker fuel prices are volatile, and, accordingly, the depreciation in the Norwegian kroner and the decline in bunker fuel prices, may not continue in the future or may reverse, with both the Norwegian kroner and bunker fuel prices increasing in the future. In addition, our results of operations for any particular period will be affected by currency exchange rates and bunker fuel prices over the entire period and not the exchange rate or bunker fuel price on any particular date. Any reversal in these trends, leading to an appreciation of the Norwegian kroner against our other operating currencies or an increase in bunker fuel prices, could have a negative impact on our results of operations, and such negative effect could be significant. The exchange rate of the Norwegian kroner and the price of bunker fuel may move in tandem, such that an increase in the price of bunker fuel is accompanied by an increase in the Norwegian kroner; as a result, the effect of fluctuations in those two factors on our results of operations could, accordingly, be particularly pronounced. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Our Financial Condition and Results of

12

Operations--Currency Effect" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Price of Bunker Fuel." Cost Saving Initiatives
In December 2013, we commenced the implementation of several new cost saving measures as part of phase four of our Efficiency Improvement Program. These initiatives include improved procurement processes as well as measures designed to enhance our bunker fuel efficiency. The new procurement processes involve the introduction of a purchasing framework designed to align procurement contract pricing with prevalent, competitive market pricing for various procurement inputs. The bunker fuel efficiency measures primarily consist of cleaning the exterior of each of our ships to remove debris annually, which will reduce drag, as well as operating our ships at a more fuel efficient speed. In addition to the cost saving measures discussed above, we have also implemented a number of revenue generating measures including offering a wider selection of dining options including an à la carte menu in our restaurants, increasing the number of points of sale and suggesting room upgrades to passengers at the time of booking. Phase four of our Efficiency Improvement Program is expected to be fully implemented by mid-2015. We expect that the preliminary results of these initiatives will be reflected in our operating results for 2015 and the full effect will be reflected in our operating results for 2016. Our Shareholders
TDR Capital, Periscopus and Home Capital indirectly own 90%, 5% and 5%, respectively, of our issued and outstanding share capital. For further information relating to our shareholders, see "Principal Shareholders."

In addition, within 70 days of the Hurtigruten Tender Offer Settlement Date, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, each of the Guarantors will grant in favor of the Security Agent on behalf of the Noteholders, security on a first-ranking basis over its material assets, including: shares of capital stock of the Guarantors; certain bank accounts; intragroup receivables; an assignment of insurance claims in respect of certain ships and any other insurance claims the Guarantors may have (if applicable); claims under the Coastal Service

The security granted by the Guarantors will, in each case, be limited and subject to certain statutory preferences under the laws of Norway, as described under "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure--Each Notes Guarantee and the Notes Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability" and "Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability."
Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .A. .n.y. p. a. y. m. .e.n.ts made by the Company or any Guarantor with respect to the Notes will be made without withholding or deduction for taxes in any relevant taxing jurisdiction unless required by law. If any of the Company or Guarantors are required by law to withhold or deduct for such taxes with respect to a payment to the holders of Notes, the Company or Guarantor will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received by the Noteholders after the withholding is not less than the amount that they would have received in the absence of the withholding, subject to certain exceptions. See "Description of the Notes--Withholding Taxes."
Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .P. r.i.o.r .to. .F.e.b.r.uary 1, 2018, the Company may redeem at its option all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus the applicable "make-whole" premium described in this offering memorandum and accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
On or after February 1, 2018, the Company may redeem at its option all or a portion of the Notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth under the caption "Description of the Notes--Optional Redemption" plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
Prior to February 1, 2018, the Company may redeem at its option on one or more occasions the Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 40% of the aggregate principal amount
19

of the Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 107.50% of the principal amount outstanding in respect of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, so long as at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding immediately after each such redemption and each such redemption occurs within 120 days after the closing date of the relevant equity offering.

Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons . . . . . . . . . . . .

In the event of certain developments affecting taxation or certain other circumstances, the Company may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See "Description of the Notes--Redemption for Taxation Reasons."

On December 2, 2014, an expert group appointed by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance presented a report to the Ministry of Finance proposing the introduction of a withholding tax on the payment of interest to recipients who are tax residents outside of Norway. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure--If certain changes to tax law were to occur, including changes recently proposed in Norway, we may have the option to redeem the Notes."

In the event such a withholding were to apply to the Notes, a redemption at the option of the Company would be permitted provided the Company could not lawfully and without incurring any material unreimbursed cost either redomicile in, or have the obligations under the Notes assumed by an entity domiciled in, a jurisdiction which does not (as of the date of the redomiciliation or assumption) impose withholding tax on payments under the Notes.

Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . U. .p.o.n. .th. e. . o. c. currence of certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. See "Description of the Notes--Change of Control."

SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA
The Company was incorporated on September 1, 2014 for the purposes of facilitating the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions and the Refinancing Transactions, including issuing the Notes offered hereby. Consequently, no historical financial information relating to the Company is available. All historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum is of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries; accordingly, all references to "we," "us," "our" or the "Group" in respect of historical financial information in this offering memorandum are to Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In particular, this offering memorandum includes audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, prepared in accordance with IFRS, and accompanying notes; and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014, prepared in accordance with IAS 34, and accompanying notes. Hurtigruten's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014 are unaudited and all information contained in this offering memorandum with respect to those periods is also unaudited.
Due to the changing nature of our continuing and discontinued operations in each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the discontinued operations in our audited consolidated financial statements for each of these years include different discontinued operations and therefore are not presented on the same basis. In the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 and in our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the comparative period financial information was changed in order to make it comparable with the current period presented. The financial information of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 disclosed in this offering memorandum have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 and the financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 disclosed in this offering memorandum have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013. The financial information of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 disclosed in this offering memorandum have been derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. As a result, the following businesses were classified as discontinued operations in the financial statements for the periods indicated with comparative balances revised to present the same discontinued operations as in the subsequent period:
· Consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014: Bus Business.
· Consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013: Bus Business.
· Consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012: Charter Business.
· Consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011: Fast Ferries Business. The Fast Ferries Business was reclassified as a continuing operation in the 2012 financial statements and the 2011 comparative balance was restated. The Fast Ferries Business no longer met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation even though we still intended to sell the Fast Ferries Business.
The financial information presented herein for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 is derived by adding the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to the audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2013 and subtracting the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The summary financial information of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 presented herein is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or generally accepted accounting principles. It has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results for any future period or our financial condition at any such date.
23

The financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries included in this offering memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statements, balance sheet or cash flow statements that might occur as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the Hurtigruten Acquisition. The Company will account for the Hurtigruten Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS, which will affect the comparability of the Company's audited consolidated financial statements with the financial information contained in this offering memorandum. Under IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair value of any contingent consideration. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair market values at the Hurtigruten Tender Offer Settlement Date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the acquirer's share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In accordance with IFRS, we have up to twelve months from the Hurtigruten Tender Offer Settlement Date to finalize the allocation of the purchase price.
Also presented below is unaudited pro forma financial information, which has been prepared to give pro forma effect to the Refinancing Transactions. The unaudited pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only and does not purport to present what our results of operations and financial condition would have been had the Refinancing Transactions or the other pro forma adjustments actually occurred on these dates, nor does it project our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. While the unaudited pro forma financial information has been derived from historical financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS, such financial information contains non-IFRS financial measures and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for our historical financial information. For more information, please see "Presentation of Financial and Other Information--Other Financial Measures." The unaudited pro forma adjustments and the unaudited pro forma financial information set out in this offering memorandum are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable but may differ materially from the actual amounts.
Our financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum cover periods before our divestment or closure (as applicable) of our Bus Business, our Charter Business and our Fast Ferries Business. We present below certain financial data on a normalized basis to allow investors to compare our historical results of operations attributable to our continuing operations. Normalized total revenues, Normalized EBITDA, Normalized capital expenditure and Normalized change in net working capital have been adjusted for each period presented to exclude in each period all Normalized Discontinued Operations; Normalized total revenues is calculated as total revenues for the relevant period as adjusted to exclude revenues for the relevant period relating to all Normalized Discontinued Operations; Normalized EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA for the relevant period as adjusted to exclude EBITDA for the relevant period relating to all Normalized Discontinued Operations; Normalized capital expenditure is calculated as capital expenditure for the relevant period as adjusted to exclude capital expenditure for the relevant period relating to all Normalized Discontinued Operations and insurance proceeds received in connection with the fire in 2011 on MS Nordlys; and Normalized change in net working capital is calculated as change in net working capital for the relevant period as adjusted to exclude change in net working capital for the relevant period relating to all Normalized Discontinued Operations and the reversal of a receivable amount due to a ruling by the ESA which required us to pay back to the Norwegian government certain revenues recorded under the Former Coastal Service Contract. Normalized Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Normalized EBITDA for the relevant period adjusted for certain extraordinary charges, costs and non-cash items; Pro forma Normalized Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Normalized Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period as adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign exchange and bunker price fluctuations and the impact of cost savings implemented by Hurtigruten. For more information on the results of operations that have been excluded from our normalized figures for each period, see "Presentation of Financial and Other Information--Other Financial Measures."
For purposes of the tables below, certain NOK amounts have been translated to euro amounts for convenience only. Balance sheet amounts as of September 30, 2014 have been translated at a rate of 1.00 = NOK 8.1162, which represents the rate of exchange as of September 30, 2014, as published by Bloomberg Generic Rate. Income and cash flow statement and other amounts for the twelve months
24

ended September 30, 2014 have been translated at a rate of 1.00 = NOK 8.2700, which represents the average rate of exchange for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, as published by Bloomberg Generic Rate.
The following tables should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, our financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The tables below should also be read together with the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The results of operations for prior years or the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future period.
For more information on the basis of preparation of this financial information, see "Presentation of Financial and Other Information" and the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The following tables show selected financial data for Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for the periods indicated.

(1) Financial data for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 has been translated for convenience only at the rate of 1.00 = NOK

8.2700, which represents the average rate of exchange for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, as published by Bloomberg

Generic Rate. Financial data as of September 30, 2014 has been translated for convenience only at the rate of 1.00 = NOK 8.1162,

which represents the rate of exchange as of September 30, 2014, as published by Bloomberg Generic Rate.

(2) Our discontinued operations relate to assets for which management at the relevant level has made a commitment to complete the sale,

and the transaction is expected to be completed within one year of the classification date. Results from the previous periods for

discontinued operations have been reclassified in order to obtain comparable figures. Therefore, the results relating to the years ended

December 31, 2011 and 2012 presented in this offering memorandum are derived from the restated numbers which appear in the audited

financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively. For further information regarding our discontinued

operations, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Factors Affecting Our

Results of Operations--Discontinued Operations."

(3) EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Normalized Adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measure.

EBITDA is calculated as our profit/(loss) from continuing operations for the period presented before income tax expense from continuing

operations, share of profit/(loss) of associates, finance expense, finance income, depreciation, amortization and impairment (loss)/

reversal for such period. See note (14) for an explanation of Normalized EBITDA. Normalized Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as

Normalized EBITDA for the relevant period adjusted for certain extraordinary charges, costs and non-cash items. Pro forma Normalized

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Normalized Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period as adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign

exchange fluctuations, the impact of cost savings implemented by Hurtigruten and to include the impact of certain additional costs. We

believe that EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Normalized Adjusted EBITDA assist in

understanding our trading performance as it gives an indication of our ability to service our indebtedness. An investor should not

consider EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted EBITDA or Pro forma Normalized Adjusted EBITDA (a) as an

alternative

to

30

operating results (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (b) as an alternative to cash flow from or used in operating, investing and financing activities (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs, or (c) as an alternative to any other measure of performance under IFRS. Because companies do not calculate EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Normalized Adjusted EBITDA identically, our presentation of EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Normalized Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other companies. The following is a reconciliation of profit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations to EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Normalized Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:

(a) Represents costs incurred to restructure and reorganize the Group, including through phase one of the Efficiency Improvement Plan implemented in 2013. Costs included in restructuring reflect moving costs associated with relocating our head office to new leased premises in Tromsø as well as base salary expenses of certain employees, who were made redundant as part of our Efficiency Improvement Program.
(b) Represents duplicate costs incurred to run multiple locations during the move from our existing office in Tromsø to our new leased corporate center in Tromsø. This relates to costs for rent paid on two leased offices in Tromsø during the period in which we relocated our head office.

31

(c) Represents exceptional consultancy costs incurred to cover certain positions on a temporary basis, as a result of the death of the former CFO, maternity leave cover for the current CFO and changes in other senior management personnel as part of a reorganization of Hurtigruten following the appointment of our current CEO, including changes to the Senior Vice President of Maritime Operations and certain human resources and IT positions, while permanent replacements were found. This adjustment reflects the additional cost of hiring consultants to fill these positions net of the salary paid to the predecessors in such positions.
(d) Represents net gains and losses on sale of property, plant and equipment. In 2012 and 2013, the gain was primarily related to the sale of our office building in Narvik.
(e) Represents non-cash share option costs incurred in connection with our share option plan, which we terminated in December 2014. The costs related to the cash settlement of such terminated share option plan will be paid following the issuance of the Notes and are not included in the amount being adjusted. We do not expect to offer share option plans to our employees in the future, or to make any further payments with respect to the terminated share option plans.

(i) Represents the net adjustment with respect to VAT refunds received following an independent review of our VAT payments initiated by Hurtigruten.
(ii) Represents legal fees incurred in connection with (a) advice in relation to the disposal of our Bus Business and Charter Business in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, (b) advice in relation to a dispute with a customer of our Charter Business in 2011 and 2012, (c) advice in relation to cooperating with inquiries made by ESA regarding the Coastal Service Contract in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and (d) advice in relation to a dispute with Stranda Hamnevesen KF regarding an increase in port taxes and fees charged by Stranda Hamnevesen KF in relation to the port in Geiranger in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.
(iii) Represents redundancy payments with respect to the termination of certain former senior executives upon their departure from the Group as part of our changes in senior management personnel as part of a reorganization of Hurtigruten following the appointment of our current CEO.
(iv) Represents insurance proceeds received in connection with the claim relating to the fire in 2011 on MS Nordlys, which proceeds were used to refurbish the damaged ship.
(v) Represents consultancy fees incurred in connection with a review of our operational processes to identify potential efficiency initiatives and measures.
(vi) Represents revenue reversals due to a ruling by the ESA which required us to pay back to the Norwegian government certain revenues recorded under the Former Coastal Service Contract during prior periods.
(vii) Represents gains due to changes in our pension scheme from a defined benefit to a defined contribution pension scheme with respect to our Norwegian administrative staff.
(viii)Represents losses incurred by Spitsbergen Travel as a result of commissions paid to external agents in connection with the cancelled sailing of MV Polar Star (a ship that we chartered) for the entire Spitsbergen season, as well as a one-time bonus of NOK 7.3 million paid to the former CEO of the Group.
(ix) Represents revenue reversals under the Coastal Service Contract as a result of two ships, MS Richard With and MS Kong Harald, being out of service in 2013 for a period of 11 days in excess of the permitted allowance pursuant to the Coastal Service Contract due to unanticipated dry-docking. Such dry-docking was in relation to certain design modifications pursuant to the 305 Classification. See "Business--Legal and Regulatory--Registration of Our Ships."
(x) Represents costs in an amount NOK 7.9 million that were paid to passengers for cancelled bookings and off-hire costs for the period MS Nordlys was under repair following a fire in 2011 that damaged the ship, as well as an additional insurance payment following such fire.
(g) Represents restructuring costs incurred in relation to the implementation of phase four of our Efficiency Improvement Program that relate to the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

32

(h) Represents the effect on Normalized Adjusted EBITDA of foreign currency exchange movements between the Norwegian kroner and each of the euro, pound sterling and U.S. dollar at September 30, 2014. The exchange rates as of September 30, 2014 used for the purposes of this adjustment were as follows: 1.00 = NOK 8.1162, £1.00 = NOK 10.4181 and $1.00 = NOK 6.4261 and excluding a loss of NOK 17.9 million in respect of foreign currency exchange swaps that were realized in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, as well as unrealized effects with respect to foreign currency exchange swaps and foreign currency effects with respect to trade receivables during the same period. Following the issuance of the Notes, which are denominated in euros, we intend to use the euros we generate to service payments with respect to the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent it is drawn, and therefore we do not currently intend to hedge foreign exchange risks relating to such currency. This foreign currency adjustment may not be indicative of our future results of operations. An appreciation of the Norwegian kroner against the pound sterling, euro or U.S. dollar could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
Foreign exchange rates are volatile, and the depreciation in the Norwegian kroner may not continue in the future or may reverse, with the relative value of the Norwegian kroner increasing in the future. In addition, our results of operations for any particular period will be affected by currency exchange rates over the entire period and not on any particular date. An appreciation of the Norwegian kroner against the pound sterling, euro or U.S. dollar could have a negative impact on our results of operations, and such negative effect could be significant. The exchange rate of the Norwegian kroner and the price of bunker fuel, one of our largest expenses, may move together, such that an increase in the price of bunker fuel would likely correspond to an increase in the Norwegian kroner; fluctuations in the price of bunker fuel could, accordingly, have particularly pronounced effects on our results of operations and the currency exchange rates that drive our results. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations-- Currency Effect."
(i) Represents revenue generating and cost saving initiatives which we have commenced but which have not been fully implemented and for which we have not yet fully realized the related impact as part of phase four of our Efficiency Improvement Program. These costs are shown net of additional expenditures incurred to implement such measures. We have implemented a number of revenue generating measures including offering a wider selection of dining options including an à la carte menu in our restaurants, increasing the number of points of sale and suggesting room upgrades to passengers at the time of booking. Costs saving initiatives include the introduction of a purchasing framework designed to align procurement contract pricing with prevalent, competitive market pricing for various procurement inputs as well as measures designed to enhance our bunker fuel efficiency, including by cleaning the exterior of each of our ships to remove debris annually, which will reduce drag, as well as operating our ships at a more fuel efficient speed. While we have implemented certain of these revenue generating and cost saving initiatives already and have achieved some results, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement all of our initiatives or that the expected results will be achieved.
(j) Represents additional operational costs we expect to incur on an ongoing basis. This includes an increase in payroll tax following a change in Norwegian tax legislation in July 2014, the introduction of more extensive medical insurance, which gives employees access to private medical care in an effort to reduce absenteeism, and measures to introduce equal pay for crew onboard all ships.
(4) Passenger cruise nights ("PCNs") is our measurement of guests volume and represents the number of guests onboard our ships and the length of their stay.
(5) Available passenger cruise nights ("APCNs") is our measurement of capacity and represents the aggregate number of available berths on each of our ships (assuming double occupancy per cabin), multiplied by the number of operated days for each the relevant ship for the period.
(6) Occupancy rate represents our PCNs for the relevant period as a percentage of our APCNs for the period. (7) Gross ticket revenues represents ticket revenues, revenues from flights, hotels, transportation, food, beverage, shop and
excursions as well as other passenger revenues, including car transportation, travel insurance and retained deposits in cases of cancellations. (8) Net ticket revenues represents Gross ticket revenues less Commissions and costs of goods for flights, hotels, transportation, food, beverage, shop and excursions as well as other passenger services, including travel insurance. (9) Gross ticket revenues per PCN represents Gross ticket revenues divided by PCNs. (10) Net ticket revenues per PCN represents Net ticket revenues divided by PCNs. (11) Gross cruise costs represents ship operating costs and selling, general and administrative expenses. (12) Net cruise costs represents Gross cruise costs less Commissions and costs of goods for flights, hotels, transportation, food, beverage, shop and excursions as well as other passenger services, including travel insurance. (13) Net cruise costs per APCN represents Net cruise costs divided by APCNs. (14) Normalized total revenues, Normalized EBITDA, Normalized capital expenditure and Normalized change in net working capital have been adjusted for each period presented to exclude in each period all Normalized Discontinued Operations. Normalized total revenues is calculated as total revenues for the relevant period as adjusted to exclude revenues for the relevant period relating to all Normalized Discontinued Operations, Normalized EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA for the relevant period as adjusted to exclude EBITDA for the relevant period relating to all Normalized Discontinued Operations, Normalized capital expenditure is calculated as capital expenditure for the relevant period as adjusted to exclude capital expenditure for the relevant period relating to all Normalized Discontinued Operations, and Normalized change in net working capital is calculated as change in net working capital for the relevant period as adjusted to exclude change in net working capital for the relevant period relating to all Normalized Discontinued Operations. (15) Normalized profit margin represents profit/(loss) for the period divided by Normalized total revenues. (16) Normalized Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Normalized Adjusted EBITDA divided by Normalized total revenues for the period. (17) Capital expenditure is calculated as the sum of the purchases in relation of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

(18) The unaudited pro forma financial information presented herein has been derived from or developed by applying pro forma adjustments to our historical net bank debt as of September 30, 2014, to give effect to the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions and the Refinancing Transactions, including the use of proceeds from the Offering, as described in "Use of Proceeds." The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial condition would have been had the Refinancing Transactions actually occurred on the date indicated, and they do not purport to project the results of operations or financial condition for any future period or as of any future date. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the information contained in "Selected Historical Financial Data," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not intended to represent pro forma financial information prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act or other SEC requirements or IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles.
(19) Pro forma cash and cash equivalents for the Restricted Group represents total cash and cash equivalents for the Restricted Group as of September 30, 2014, adjusted to give effect to the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions and the Refinancing Transactions as described in "Use of Proceeds." This amount excludes cash and cash equivalents of NOK 33.9 million of the SPEs as of September 30, 2014. See also "Capitalization."
(20) Pro forma debt for the Restricted Group as of September 30, 2014, represents total debt of the Restricted Group as adjusted to give effect to the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions and the Refinancing Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds as contemplated under the "Use of Proceeds," as if they had occurred on September 30, 2014. This amount excludes indebtedness of Kystruten KS, which is one of the SPEs, in an amount of NOK 36.8 million under its credit facility as of September 30, 2014. The indebtedness of Kystruten KS is consolidated in the financial results of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries but is non-recourse to the Restricted Group. See also "Capitalization."
(21) Pro forma net debt for the Restricted Group represents Pro forma debt less Pro forma cash and cash equivalents. (22) Pro forma cash interest expense represents interest payable for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, adjusted to give effect to
the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions and the Refinancing Transactions, including (i) the Offering of the Notes and the use of proceeds as contemplated under "Use of Proceeds," as if they had occurred on October 1, 2013, (ii) interest payable with respect to the drawings of NOK 250.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, assuming that this amount had been drawn during the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 and (iii) commitment fees payable on the Revolving Credit Facility, assuming a committed amount of NOK 287.6 million had been available and undrawn during the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. Pro forma cash interest expense excludes the non-cash interest expense relating to the amortization of the debt issuance costs in connection with the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions and the Refinancing Transactions. Pro forma cash interest expense has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our cash interest expense would have actually been had the foregoing events occurred on the dates assumed, nor does it purport to project our cash interest expense for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. Pro forma cash interest expense with respect to our euro-denominated indebtedness under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 has been calculated using the rate of 1.00 = NOK 8.2700, which represents the average rate of exchange for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, as published by Bloomberg Generic Rate.

RISK FACTORS
An investment in the Notes involves risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with other information provided to you in this offering memorandum, in deciding whether to invest in the Notes. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could be detrimental to our financial performance. If these events occur, the trading price of the Notes could decline, we may not be able to pay all or part of the interest or principal on the Notes, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks not currently known to us or that are presently deemed immaterial may also harm us and affect your investment.
This offering memorandum contains "forward looking" statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences are discussed below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum. See "Forward Looking Statements."
Risks Relating to Our Business and Operations
Adverse impact of general economic conditions and natural conditions could reduce the demand for our product offerings, particularly cruises, and could adversely impact our operations.
The demand for our product offerings is affected by international, national and local economic conditions, and a decrease in demand for our product offerings would adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flow, ability to borrow funds to finance our operations, future growth and demand for cruises and transport. Adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, such as higher bunker fuel prices, higher interest rates, stock and real estate market declines and volatility, more restrictive consumer credit markets or higher taxes, could reduce the level of discretionary income and our customers' ability or willingness to spend in the countries from which we source our guests, including Norway, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom. The recent global economic downturn has had an adverse effect on consumer confidence and discretionary income, which resulted in decreased demand for vacation services as well as price discounting in order to attract customers. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including products from our offer, often decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty. In such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, or may experience a loss of market share as consumers trade down to cheaper products offered by some of our competitors or non-cruise alternatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including in particular on our margins and profitability, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Adverse changes in the global economy, such as the recent global economic downturn, or in any of the regions in which we sell our products, could reduce consumer confidence, and thereby could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If unfavorable economic conditions return, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected, in particular if customers reduce discretionary spending.
There can be no assurance that in the future the number of tourists traveling on our voyages or visiting our hotels will match current levels or that any decline in the number of such guests will be wholly or partly offset by any increased traffic by local residents on holiday or taking advantage of our local transportation services. A significant reduction in the number of tourists traveling on our voyages or visiting our hotels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In a challenging and uncertain economic environment, we cannot predict whether or when circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact if any such circumstances could have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Also, we cannot predict the timing or strength of any economic recovery. Although we offer a year-round service that combines local transportation, cargo and tourism voyages, if we were to experience a sustained economic downturn for an extended period of time we could experience a prolonged period of decreased demand and price discounting.
Severe or unseasonal weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels and could
35

affect our ability to operate our normal itineraries. For example, in 2010, due to the ash cloud over Iceland, we had to accept some cancellations and re-bookings due to flight cancellations, which resulted in our guests not being able to get to and from the turnaround ports from which we operate. As a result, we incurred some losses with respect to these cancellations and re-bookings, including lost revenue which was not covered by insurance. We may be subject to other circumstances beyond our control that adversely affect our operations.
Moreover, interest rates, currency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to obtain debt or equity financing are dependent on many economic, market and political factors. Increases in operating or financing costs could adversely affect our results because we may not be able to recover these increased costs through price increases charged to our guests and such increases may adversely impact our liquidity and credit ratings.
The recent global economic downturn has in the past and may in the future adversely impact our suppliers or travel agents, which can result in disruptions in service and financial losses.
We face competition from cruise and transportation companies as well as vacation alternatives and we may not be able to compete effectively.
International cruise operators have had an increasing presence in Norway over the past few years and, as a result, pressure from international competitors on the Norwegian coast is growing. The cruise component of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment and our MS Fram segment face significant competition from other cruise providers based on various factors including price, brand proposition, relationships with travel agencies and the types and sizes of ships and cabins, services and destinations offered. Although we are the only port-to-port passenger and cargo transportation provider covering the full journey between Bergen and Kirkenes, we face competition from other land and sea-based transportation companies such as bus companies, the Norwegian State Railways, domestic airlines, local ferries and trucking companies.
We face different competitors with respect to our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast products, MS Fram products and Spitsbergen Travel products. While our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast product offers a distinct voyage experience and provides local transportation services under the Coastal Service Contract, we still compete with large cruise operators, particularly in the summer months. MS Fram faces competition in the expedition segment, including from smaller ships primarily operating in Antarctica and Spitsbergen/Greenland, larger competitors and specialty expedition brands. Smaller luxury brands are also growing in prominence as demand in the expedition segment increases. Our Spitsbergen Travel segment competes with other hotels and vacation service providers in Svalbard and elsewhere. We could face an increase in competition in the future if new players enter the market, including if international cruise operators use existing ships that currently serve other markets to provide additional offerings in Norway and Polar regions.
We face a variety of competitive challenges, including:
· anticipating and responding to changing travel and holiday trends and consumer demands;
· developing a distinct and innovative portfolio of products including cruises and excursions to different destinations and with different onboard and off-board activities that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes;
· developing a strong brand image with a consistent product offering across our reservation centers, our website and our geographies;
· offering a high and consistent quality of services;
· successfully operating a diversified range of tourist and local transport products;
· outsourcing certain services efficiently;
· relying on travel agents that also offer competing vacation packages and tourist products;
· competitively pricing our products, achieving customer perception of value and providing quality services;
· undertaking effective and appropriate promotional activities and responding to promotional activities of our competitors;
36

· effectively and efficiently operating our reservation centers, online and third-party booking systems;
· website design, mobile application and online presence;
· advertising and branding; and
· attracting and retaining talented people.
We seek to differentiate our brand proposition by offering an experience focused on local culture and heritage and close proximity to nature to our guests; however, such offering may not be conducive to achieving high levels of repeat visits since it may be perceived as a "once in a lifetime" experience. Our programs to motivate previous guests to travel with us again may not be successful and our guests may elect not to travel with us again. Moreover, our nature-based offering may not appeal to a wide range of vacationers who may be looking for a different type of experience. We operate in the wider vacation industry and our product offerings are only a few of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation. We therefore face competition not only from direct competitors, but also from vacation operators that provide other travel and leisure options, including, but not limited to, hotels, resorts, theme parks, packaged holidays and tours, casino operators and vacation ownership properties in the areas we operate or elsewhere.
In the event that we are unable to compete effectively with other cruise companies, transportation companies or vacation service providers, our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.

A significant portion of our revenue comes from passenger and cargo transportation services governed by the Coastal Service Contract, which expires in 2019.
Our operation of the coastal passenger and cargo transportation service between Bergen and Kirkenes is governed by our current Coastal Service Contract with the Norwegian government represented by the Ministry of Transport, which was entered into in April 2011 and expires on December 31, 2019, and which may be extended for an additional year at the option of the Ministry of Transport. A significant portion of our annual revenue is attributable to the Coastal Services Contract and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, the Coastal Services Contract accounted for 20.8% of our Normalized total revenues.

Both the duration of and the fee pursuant to the Coastal Service Contract are conditional upon the Norwegian parliament making the necessary funds available each year in the annual state budget. The Norwegian government as a whole is only able to make spending commitments for one year at a time given that its budget requires parliamentary approval each year. The Coastal Service Contract is subject to the same approvals as other government contracts in Norway and necessary funds have been made available in all previous years as part of the budgetary process. In the event that the funds required to pay our fees under the Coastal Service Contract are not made available in the annual state budget, we may experience difficulty in receiving our contractual fees for the relevant period.

We may also be unable to renew the Coastal Service Contract when it expires at the end of 2019. The Ministry of Transport could choose not to enter into a new contract after 2019. If the Ministry of Transport does choose to enter into a new coastal service contract, it could do so on substantially different terms, including a different fee structure, any of which could make the contract less profitable. Any new coastal service contract would likely be subject to a public tender process, in which case we could face intense competition for the award of the contract, and we may not be awarded the new contract on commercially favorable terms, or at all.

If we lose the benefits of the Coastal Service Contract or the benefits of the license to operate the route

along the Norwegian coast between Bergen and Kirkenes, whether following its expiration or as a result of the

Norwegian parliament not providing the necessary funds for the program, it could have an adverse impact on our

business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition to losing a significant portion of our

revenues, we would be forced to reposition our business and re-adjust our cost base, which we may not be able to

do efficiently because of the specialized nature of our product offering and our ships. Our fleet is currently

purpose-built to provide numerous port calls along the coast from Bergen and Kirkenes each day, including at

many

remote

ports,

and

we

may

37

experience difficulty in finding suitable alternative routes for our vessels and effecting the related changes to our operations in the event we do not operate along the same route, including quickly adjusting our fixed costs base to reflect reduced operating levels for our vessels. Moreover, due to the configuration and size of our ships, we may not be able to successfully compete with large cruise operators and would, accordingly, be limited in the ways we could reposition our business following the loss of the Coastal Service Contract or the license to operate the route along the Norwegian coast between Bergen and Kirkenes. The loss of the Coastal Service Contract could also adversely affect our brand recognition. Finally, if a competitor is awarded the new coastal service contract, we could experience increased competition from that company, in both our local transportation and cargo transportation businesses, if we continue to provide these services, and in our cruise business. For more information, see "Business--Our Segments--Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast--Coastal Service Contract."

The fees under the Coastal Service Contract are subject to downward adjustments and increased operating costs could render the Coastal Service Contract unprofitable.
Our fee under the Coastal Service Contract is subject to downward adjustments if we do not fulfill the agreed service requirements. If for example, one of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships was to fall out of service for a period in excess of that permitted under the Coastal Service Contract and we as a consequence were unable to ensure 34 northbound and 33 southbound daily departures from ports, the fee could be reduced by 1/6 of the daily fee for each cancelled port. We have certain exceptions that permit us to cancel a certain number of port departures per year without penalty under the Coastal Service Contract. For example, we have an allowance of 10 operating days per ship per year due to planned maintenance and unforeseen operational disturbances, two operating days per ship per year are permitted for using the ships for cultural events and cancellations due to bad weather conditions and other documented force majeure events as well as safety reasons and strikes are accepted. However, in 2012 and 2013 we cancelled a number of port departures in excess of the amount permitted under the Coastal Service Contract, which resulted in reductions in our fee of NOK 11.8 million and NOK 15.5 million, respectively. The Ministry of Transport is, furthermore, entitled to demand cancellation of the contract in the event of a significant default, including repeated failures to meet obligations and repeated unfulfilled requests for remediation.
We are also required to comply with various contractual terms and additional requirements under the Coastal Service Contract, and we may be required to incur additional costs of compliance in connection therewith. Our fee under the Coastal Service Contract is subject to adjustment for an increase in certain of our operating costs due to inflation, as measured by Statistics Norway's cost index for coastal and interior travel subindex for ferry operations. However, because cost increases are measured based on the previous twelve months as of February 15 of the prior year, our recovery of increased costs could be delayed by almost two years. Moreover, increases in certain costs, including port fees and taxes, do not entitle us to an adjustment of our fee under the Coastal Service Contract, and the adjustments made under the inflation indexation for other operating costs, such as bunker fuel, may not be sufficient to cover the full extent of such increases; thus we cannot assure that the inflation indexation will accurately reflect, and compensate us for, all of our increased operating costs. In particular, in recent years, we have experienced significant increases in port fees and taxes at some of the ports where we are required to stop under the Coastal Service Contract and we have not been able to claim an adjustment of our fee under the Coastal Service Contract for those increases. See "--The Coastal Service Contract requires us to provide certain services and, accordingly, restricts our ability to offer other services that may be more profitable." and "--An increase in port taxes or fees or other adverse change of our terms of business with the authorities operating the ports in which we call could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects."

The Coastal Service Contract requires us to provide certain services and, accordingly, restricts our ability to offer other services that may be more profitable.

Our operation of the coastal passenger and cargo transportation service between Bergen and Kirkenes is

governed by our current Coastal Service Contract. Pursuant to our Coastal Service Contract, we are required to

ensure 34 northbound and 33 southbound daily departures from ports throughout the year. We are required to

provide local passenger transport on the entire route between Bergen and Kirkenes. In addition, we are required

to

offer

cargo

transport

on

the

Tromsø-Kirkenes

38

round-trip route. Under the Coastal Service Contract, our ships are required to have minimum capacity for 320 guests, berth capacity for 120 guests and cargo capacity of 150 euro pallets (in the cargo hold at standard cargo height). Our ships must also have certain passenger facilities, including food service. Because we are required to make a high number of port departures at specific ports each day, we are unable to adjust our itineraries or relocate our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships to take advantage of more profitable opportunities during our peak periods or to reduce our number of voyages and costs during periods of low utilization. In particular, we are unable to relocate our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships to more profitable areas during winter months and continue to incur certain fixed costs, particularly payroll and bunker fuel costs, year-round. Moreover, because we are required to provide certain services and facilities on all of our ships servicing the Coastal Service Contract, we have a limited ability to adjust our product offerings and available facilities to meet changing customer demands.
Our cost base largely comprises fixed costs and, because the Coastal Service Contract requires us to make a certain number of port calls each day, we have a limited ability to vary our itineraries to meet changing consumer demand trends. Therefore, our operating profits are more sensitive to potential declines in consumer demand compared to commercial cruise operators. Because we are required to operate a full schedule regardless of consumer demand, we have a limited ability to reduce fuel costs, port costs and staffing costs by cutting down on services during periods of lower occupancy.
We are currently involved in discussions with the Ministry of Transport regarding the interpretation of certain terms of the Coastal Service Contract, including our obligations to offer minimum berth capacity. According to the Coastal Service Contract, our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships must have a minimum of berth capacity for 120 guests; the issue relates to whether or not these 120 berths must be reserved for certain categories of short distance guests. See "Business--Legal and Regulatory--Legal Proceedings." If we cannot resolve this matter or if we are found to be in material breach of the contract, we may be required to reserve additional berths for our port-to-port guests or the Ministry of Transport could have a right to terminate the Coastal Service Contract, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Increases in bunker fuel prices or other operating costs may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and liquidity.
We are exposed to price volatility with respect to bunker fuel, which is used to operate our ships. Economic, market and political conditions around the world, such as bunker fuel and oil demand, regulatory requirements, supply disruptions and related infrastructure needs, make it difficult to predict the future price and availability of bunker fuel and oil. Bunker fuel expenses accounted for 16.4%, 17.3%, 16.5% and 12.4% of our total payroll costs and other operating costs in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 and in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The price of oil is internationally traded in U.S. dollars, and the price of bunker fuel, which we purchase in Norwegian kroner, is correlated to the U.S. dollar denominated price of oil; our need to purchase bunker fuel, accordingly, increases our exposure both to oil price fluctuations and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Although we hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in bunker fuel prices through quarterly rolling hedges of 0­100% of estimated future consumption as well as foreign currency exposure, there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will provide a sufficient level of protection against increases in bunker fuel prices or that our counterparties will be able to perform, such as in the case of a counterparty bankruptcy. A significant or continued increase in bunker fuel prices or the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, to the extent that such increase exceeds our swaps to manage such exposures. Conversely, since we enter into bunker fuel hedging arrangements in advance, we may incur losses with respect to such hedges to the extent that bunker fuel prices decrease compared to the hedged price. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Our Financial Condition and Results of Operation--Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations--Price of Bunker Fuel."

Furthermore, as our operations have a direct influence on the natural environment, we have opted to use

marine gas oil for MS Fram and marine special distillate on the ships serving the Norwegian coast. These are

among the most environment-friendly fuel grades in the business and fulfill the requirements set for voyages in

the most vulnerable areas. However, these environmental fuels cost more than their regular alternatives and their

prices

are

subject

to

fluctuations.

In

case

prices

39

of such fuels increase significantly in comparison to regular fuels, we could be forced to use less environmentfriendly fuel grades, which could limit our operations in certain areas and prevent us from fulfilling our NOx emissions reduction target pursuant to our agreement with the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise's NOx fund or otherwise impede our corporate social responsibility strategies. See "Business--Legal and Regulatory-- Environment." If we do not meet our targets under the NOx fund, we may be required to pay increased taxes in respect of the increased emissions.
Furthermore, we believe that our land-based vacation competitors' operating costs are less affected by bunker fuel price increases than cruise companies. Accordingly, bunker fuel price increases may adversely impact us more than our land-based competitors.
Future increases in the global price of bunker fuel could also increase our other expenses, such as crew travel, cargo and commodity prices. We may be unable to increase ticket prices or introduce bunker fuel supplements, which would help to fully or partially offset these bunker fuel price increases.
Moreover, we could experience increases in other operating costs, due to market forces and economic or political instability beyond our control. For example, in July 2014, payroll tax with respect to our crew increased following a change in Norwegian tax legislation in July 2014. As a result, our crew costs have increased. Our other operating costs include, but are not limited to, food, payroll, repairs and maintenance, security and other commodity-based items.
Our business may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
We are exposed on a transactional and translational basis to movements in the exchange rate of NOK principally against the euro, and to a lesser extent against the U.S. dollar and pound sterling. This is primarily due to the fact that we typically have more operating costs than revenues in Norwegian kroner. For example, in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated 46% of our Operational Revenues in Norwegian kroner and Operating Costs incurred in Norwegian kroner accounted for 50% of our Operational Revenues. In addition, a portion of our fuel costs relating to NOx tax, fuel taxes and retailers' margin are also denominated in NOK. If the Norwegian kroner had strengthened by 5% against the euro during the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 with all other variables held constant, our EBITDA would have been NOK 40.5 million lower for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.
We terminated our former foreign currency exchange swaps as part of the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions at a cost of NOK 134.0 million, resulting in an impairment charge of NOK 82.5 million. Following the issuance of the Notes, which will be denominated in euros, we intend to use the euros we generate to service our obligations under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent it is drawn, and therefore we do not currently intend to hedge foreign exchange risks relating to such currency.
If the Norwegian kroner appreciates relative to the euro, U.S. dollars or pound sterling, certain of our sourcing costs may rise. If we are unable to pass on increases to our cost base, we may incur higher cost of sales and lower margins.
Our revenues are seasonal owing to occupancy levels and variations in prices at different times of the year.
Demand for our services is seasonal, with greatest demand generally occurring during the second and third calendar quarters of each year. See "Business--Seasonality." This seasonality in demand results in fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations with 65.0% of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 generated during the second and third calendar quarters of 2014. Although we typically schedule our dry-docking during our non-peak periods in order to maximize our revenue during peak seasons, we may be required to dry-dock ships requiring necessary repairs or essential maintenance, particularly with respect to our older ships, during our peak season.
As a result of seasonality in demand, our results of operations are not evenly distributed over the course of the year. However, a significant proportion of our expenses is incurred more evenly throughout the year. Therefore, our profitability fluctuates during the year and we record less revenues during the first and fourth quarter compared to the remainder of the year. In addition, as a result of the
40

seasonal nature of our business, we experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly working capital requirements. Fluctuations in our quarterly working capital are driven by revenue levels, operating costs, drydockings and the collection of deposits on pre-booked trips, especially during September and October as well as January and February, which constitute our peak booking periods and the periods when capital expenditures are at their highest, in line with our dry-docking schedule. Accordingly, our liquidity is typically at its highest during our peak season from June through August, and at its lowest during March and April depending on our drydocking schedule. Thus, there is a risk that we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to cover expenses, particularly during certain periods of the year.
Our results of operations are susceptible to unseasonable changes in weather and we may be affected by adverse weather conditions.
Extreme weather events, adverse weather and climate conditions may disrupt or require us to alter or cancel our cruise or hotel operations. Extreme weather events, adverse weather and climate conditions could also disrupt commercial airline flights that transport our guests to the geographies in which we operate. Our insurance does not cover additional cost related to delays or cancellations of ports due to weather conditions. In addition, we may incur costs in providing alternative transportation to those guests onboard our ships that need to get to the next port, and we may lose revenue from commissions paid to us by our excursion partners at ports where we cancel calls. We are not obliged to cover costs for transporting guests on their way to a ship if such ship service is cancelled unless the guest has booked a travel package including ancillary transportation such as flights through us. If the guest has booked such package and started their journey, we have to refund the purchase price for such package and in certain instances have to cover their costs associated with transporting such guests back to the point where they initiated their journey. In most cases with respect to our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast product, where we have ships departing every day, we try to re-book such guests to a ship that is departing either the day before or the day after, however, if we are unable to re-book the guests, we would refund the cost of their tickets (including their deposit). In addition, inclement weather conditions may prevent or discourage our guests from electing our services altogether. In addition, extreme weather conditions could result in increased wave and wind activity, which would make it more challenging to sail and dock our ships and could cause sea/motion sickness among guests and crew. The risk of adverse weather is in particular high with respect to our MS Fram segment, which operates in Polar waters and our Spitsbergen Travel segment, which operates in Spitsbergen, where weather conditions are extreme. Weather events could have an adverse impact on the safety of, and our customers' satisfaction with, our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Extreme weather events or other adverse weather may also disrupt the supply chain from or to the impacted region and could disrupt our bunker fuel, food and shore power supplies. Finally, extreme weather conditions could cause property damage to our ships, port and related commercial facilities and other assets and impact our ability to obtain insurance coverage for operations in such areas at reasonable rates.
Our success depends upon the continued strength of our brand and our ability to distinguish ourselves from our competitors.
We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to expanding our customer base. We aim to distinguish ourselves from our competitors by branding our services as a distinct, authentic and active experience. Some of our competitors have greater market presence and name recognition and stronger brands than we have or are perceived to offer premium or luxury cruises and therefore greater value than we offer. In addition, some of our competitors may be perceived to offer better quality services or more easily accessible or adventurous routes than we offer. To the extent that we are unable to maintain or enhance consumers' confidence in our brand or to successfully distinguish our offering from other cruise providers, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.
Certain competitors have greater financial resources, greater purchasing economies of scale and lower cost bases than us. Consequently they may be able to afford to spend more on marketing and advertising campaigns thereby attracting market share. Some of our competitors may be able to react more swiftly to changes in market conditions and may have a material competitive advantage allowing
41

them to utilize their greater market presence, stronger brand or other advantages when navigating new or changing markets. Certain of our competitors may also be able to accept lower prices than we can offer or withstand higher costs for longer than we can withstand. The adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing, intensive promotional activities and discounts, as well as our actions to seek to maintain our competitiveness and reputation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Our operations may be subject to incidents involving safety and security of our guests and employees.
The operation of our ships, shore excursions and other land-based activities involves the risk of serious incidents, including those caused by fire on-board our ships, improper operation of our ships, groundings, snowmobiles and Polar circle boat trips; accidents involving dog sledding; attacks by polar bears; guest and employee illnesses, collisions and navigational errors; as well as other incidents. For example, on February 15, 2014 we were forced to end an Antarctica cruise earlier than scheduled due to a medical emergency involving one of our passengers. As a higher proportion of our guests tend to be older, we may face a higher incidence of guest illness. As a result, we may be required to deviate from our route in order to seek medical attention for guests suffering from serious illnesses. Such incidents may result in a disruption to our scheduled service, which may result in complaints by other guests. In addition, accidents or attacks on our guests could damage our reputation or lead to litigation, which in turn, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
The operation of ships also involves the risk of other incidents at sea or while in port, including missing guests, inappropriate crew or guest behavior and onboard crimes, which may bring into question the safety of our guests, may adversely affect future industry performance and may lead to litigation against us. Any such event may result in loss of life or property, loss of revenue or increased costs, guest and crew discomfort and the alteration of itineraries or cancellation of a journey.
We have from time to time experienced serious accidents, including loss of lives, and other incidents involving our ships and land-based activities in the past, and there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur in the future. For example, on September 15, 2011, the MS Nordlys experienced a fire following a breakdown in the engine room. Two members of our crew died and two other members of our crew sustained injuries. To the extent that we encounter a serious accident or other safety related event, we may be required to delay or cancel a trip, face civil or criminal liability or incur significant costs. Any such event involving our ships or land-based activities may bring into question guest and employee health, safety and security and may adversely affect our brand reputation, guest satisfaction and demand for our services in general, as well as our sales and profitability and may result in additional costs to our business and increasing government or other regulatory oversight. An adverse judgment or settlement in respect of any claim against us may also lead to negative publicity about us. In addition, such events involving our Group or our industry may affect customer confidence in using our service or choosing to participate in cruise activities. A decline in customer appetite for the products we offer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Anything that damages our reputation (whether or not justified), including adverse publicity about guest safety, could have an adverse impact on demand, which could lead to price discounting and a reduction in our sales. Finally, some of the same factors that impact our guests' decisions to purchase our product offerings may also impact our ability to employ qualified employees.

Our business and results of operations are dependent on our fleet of ships. A prolonged breakdown or loss of any ship could have a significant adverse impact on our operations and financial position. In addition, prolonged or repeated disruptions in our scheduled service under the Coastal Service Contract could result in material breach under such contract.

Our fleet consists of 12 ships, of which 11 are utilized to fulfill our contractual obligations under the Coastal

Service Contract to ensure 34 northbound and 33 southbound daily departures from ports along the coast from

Bergen and Kirkenes throughout the year. See "--The Coastal Service Contract requires us to provide certain

services and, accordingly, restricts our ability to offer other services that may be more profitable." Accordingly,

we are more dependent on the successful operation of our individual cruise ships compared to some of our

competitors with larger fleets. If any one of our 12 cruise ships were to cease operations for an extended period

of

time,

for

example

due

to

42

mechanical failure, an extended dry-dock or maintenance needs, our business, brand, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be negatively impacted. For example, MS Nordlys was out of service for approximately seven months while we conducted repairs resulting from the fire onboard such ship in 2011. In addition, four of our ships were out of service for longer than scheduled due to prolonged dry-docking between January 1, 2012 and September 30, 2014. In the event of a cancellation of a voyage or part of a voyage, we aim to re-book our guests to other ships. However, this may not be possible, particularly in our peak season when utilization rates on our ships are highest. In addition, if prolonged dry-docking results in canceled port calls in excess of the amount permitted by the Coastal Service Contract, our fee under the contract will be reduced, which could make the contract unprofitable. Furthermore, we carry loss of hire insurance for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships in the period from April 15 through September 30 each year and for MS Fram throughout the year; however, the insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses or may not cover losses that occur during periods of the year during which we do not carry such insurance. Our ships are purpose-built and specialized for our operations and the total loss of any of our ships could result in a significant disruption to our business. In particular, except for MS Lofoten and MS Vesterålen, we maintain hull and machinery insurance on all of our ships, based on market value and the replacement value of our ships may be significantly higher. In the case of MS Lofoten and MS Vesterålen, due to the age of these ships, we maintain hull and machinery insurance for an amount less than their market value. In addition, the replacement of any of our ships may involve significant delays and expense. The total loss of a ship could also negatively affect our reputation, which could, in turn, negatively affect our business, results of operations and prospects.
In addition, any prolonged disruption in our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment's ability to provide the daily port departures required by the Coastal Service Contract could result in a breach of the contract. If we were to materially breach the Coastal Service Contract, the Ministry of Transport could impose a significant reduction in the payment under the contract, make a claim for compensation or terminate the contract, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations. See "--A significant portion of our revenue comes from passenger and cargo transportation services governed by the Coastal Service Contract, which expires in 2019" and "--The fees under the Coastal Service Contract are subject to downward adjustments and increased operating costs could render the Coastal Service Contract unprofitable."
Our inability to implement our ship repairs, maintenance and refurbishments on terms and within timeframes that are favorable or consistent with our expectations could reduce our profitability.
The repair, maintenance and refurbishment of our ships are complex processes and involve risks similar to those encountered in other large and sophisticated construction, repair, maintenance and refurbishment projects. We could experience delays and cost overruns in completing such work. For example, we experienced prolonged delays with respect to completing scheduled dry-docking work in relation to MS Polarlys and MS Richard With in 2013. The work required for these ships took longer than expected to complete, and our fee under the Coastal Service Contract was reduced in line with the terms of the agreement, which provides for a penalty to be imposed in the event that the number of cancelled port calls exceeds a certain threshold. As our fleet ages, our repair and maintenance expenses have increased due to additional repair and maintenance work to be performed. For example, our two oldest ships, MS Lofoten and MS Vesterålen, were constructed in 1964 and 1983, respectively, and require a significantly higher amount of maintenance and repair work compared to our other ships. Such additional maintenance works typically include replacement of obsolete equipment, including electrical, automation, communication and navigation systems.
In addition, other events, such as work stoppages and other labor actions, insolvencies, "force majeure" events or other financial difficulties experienced at the shipyards and among the subcontractors and suppliers that build, repair, maintain or refurbish our ships could prevent or delay the completion of the refurbishment, repair and maintenance of our ships. These events could adversely affect our operations, including causing delays or cancellations of our trips or unscheduled or prolonged dry-docks and repairs. Any termination or breach of contract on our part following such an event may result in, among other things, the forfeiture of prior deposits or payments made by us as well as potential claims by our guests against us if our ships are out of service and we cannot provide alternative services. A significant delay in the refurbishment or repair of one or more of our ships, or a significant performance deficiency or mechanical failure of a ship, particularly in light of decreasing
43

availability of dry-dock facilities, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
In addition, the consolidation of the control of certain cruise shipyards, capacity reductions at shipyards or insolvencies could result in less shipyard availability thus reducing competition and increasing prices. We typically use shipyards in close proximity to our routes, in particular for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment, which limits our options for choosing shipyards and could exacerbate the impact on our business from any consolidations, capacity reductions or insolvencies. Finally, the lack of qualified shipyard repair facilities could result in the inability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis, which could also result in reduced profitability.
Overcapacity in the cruise ship and vacation industry could have a negative impact on our net revenue, which, in turn, could adversely affect profitability.
According to Cruise Industry News, cruise fleet capacity in Europe has increased at a CAGR of 6.4% between the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2013 and is forecast to increase at a CAGR of 4.3% between the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2017 based on existing ship orders, known ship withdrawals and deployment changes. Cruise capacity in Norway and the Polar regions could grow faster than the rest of Europe if a greater proportion of the cruise fleet in Europe were to target these destinations.
In order to profitably utilize its increased capacity, the European cruise industry would need to grow at a rate equivalent to or in excess of capacity growth. In recent years, demand has grown at a faster rate than capacity for Europe as a whole. However, a change in this trend could negatively affect our business and results of operation.
Our business and results of operation could also be negatively impacted by overcapacity in the wider vacation industry. Our services compete not only with other cruise competitors but also with other vacation and adventure expedition alternatives, which may be cheaper and/or provide the same explorer element as we offer our guests. If there were an industry-wide increase in capacity in the cruise industry or the wider vacation industry without a corresponding increase in public demand, we could experience reduced occupancy rates and be forced to discount our prices, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition (including the impairment of the value of our ships, goodwill and trademark assets), results of operations and prospects.
We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in the Valuation Report of our ships are correct, accurate or complete.
This offering memorandum refers to a valuation report (the "Valuation Report") prepared by V.Ships with respect to certain of our ships. V.Ships has carried out its valuation based upon information supplied by us, which it has assumed to be correct and comprehensive. In particular, V.Ships:
· has relied on a broker valuation provided by Octagon Shipping (the "Broker Valuation"), an independent ship broker, which is based on a desktop valuation;
· has relied on market data with respect to building ships of a similar size and purpose compared to our ships;
· has not undertaken a full survey of the relevant ships but has relied upon the information provided by us; and
· has relied on information we have provided in relation to the amount of capital expenditures required for dry-docking, routine repair and maintenance and other expenses in relation to compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, including expenses in connection with the 305 Classification, that are expected to be required over the next five years for each ship.
Any opinions or conclusions reached in the Valuation Report are dependent upon a number of assumptions and economic conditions that may or may not occur and a number of forward-looking estimates that may not be correct. In addition, the Valuation Report is based, in part, on information provided by third parties in relation to market values and estimated shipbuilding costs. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance upon the valuation taken from the Valuation Report and reported herein.
44

Other appraisers may reach different valuations of our ships. Moreover, the value determined in the Valuation Report could be significantly higher than the amount that would be obtained from the actual sale of the relevant ships, especially in a distressed or liquidation scenario. Accordingly, the Valuation Report should not be considered a representation of the actual present or future value of such ships. The realizable value of our ships at any given time will depend on various factors, including:
· market, economic and industry conditions, including demand and capacity for our services; · the intended use of the relevant ships by the buyer; · the availability of buyers; · the availability of financing; · the time period in which the ships are to be sold; · the availability of similar ships; · the condition of the ships; and · other operational risks.
In addition, we anticipate that the appraised value of our ships will change over time, and it may change materially. After the issuance of the Notes, neither third parties nor we will provide the holders of Notes with revised valuations and we expressly disclaim any duty to update such valuations under any circumstances.
A failure to successfully implement our business strategy and the final phase of our Efficiency Improvement Program may adversely affect our business. In addition, management's attention may be diverted from existing operations to the process of taking the company private following the Hurtigruten Acquisition.
Our strategies prioritize increasing our revenues and achieving cost effective operations through the continued implementation of our efficiency improvement program ("Efficiency Improvement Program"). Our strategy is subject to a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. For example, if we are not successful in negotiating favorable terms under our supply agreements for future periods, we may not realize the cost savings we expect to achieve on an ongoing basis. The success of our Efficiency Improvement Program is subject to our ability to monitor our costs and implement and continue ongoing efficiency management, including, for example, introducing increased onboard services and sales, reduced crew costs, optimizing bunker fuel consumption and procurement synergies. Our projected cost efficiencies and savings may not be realized or we may incur other unanticipated costs.
We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement our strategies on a timely basis or at all, or that any or all of our strategy will be successful or profitable. Failure to effectively implement or achieve any or all of our strategies or our Efficiency Improvement Program may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, prior to the Hurtigruten Acquisition, we were a publicly traded company in Norway and the process of taking Hurtigruten private may require the reorganization of certain management and operational roles, which may divert the attention of our management team. If management is not focused on implementing our business strategy, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
We lease two of our 12 ships and our business is subject to the risks and costs associated with such leases. In December 2002 and June 2003, we sold two of our ships to Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS,
respectively, under sale and leaseback transactions. Since such time, we have leased MS Richard With and MS Nordlys under 15 year bareboat leases with Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, respectively. Each of MS Richard With and MS Nordlys is used to service our Coastal Service Contract.
Each bareboat lease agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain minimum liquidity at all times, and non-compliance with the covenant is a default under the contract
45

and could result in the relevant agreement being terminated by the vessel owner. See "Business--Our Fleet." Accordingly, any failure to meet our minimum liquidity obligations under the leases could adversely affect our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment's ability to carry out its cruise operations or fulfill its obligations under the Coastal Service Contract, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
The lease agreements expire in February 2018 for MS Richard With and August 2018 for MS Nordlys, respectively, in each case with an option to extend for up to an additional five years on market terms. We require approval from the owner before we can make any alterations to the physical structure of either leased ship. The owners have the right to have the ships returned in the same condition as the ships were delivered to us, with customary exceptions for normal wear and tear. Following the expiration of these leases, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these leases on commercially favorable terms, or at all. If we do not extend or renew the leases, we may need to lease other ships or alternatively, purchase ships so that our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment can continue to provide its product offering without disruption. There may be unforeseen costs involved with returning the ships to their original condition or the Company may experience difficulty in renewing the leases after they expire. As a result, we may not be able to renew the leases on favorable terms, or at all. Such risks related to our leased ships could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

An increase in port taxes or fees or other adverse change of our terms of business with the authorities operating the ports in which we call could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
In recent years, port authorities operating ports-of-call that we regularly visit have assessed new taxes, introduced new fees or raised existing taxes or fees charged for the use of such ports, including, but not limited to, value added taxes on tickets and onboard revenues and changes in the scope of income included in tonnage based tax regimes. Our port costs for the Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment have increased from NOK 77.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to NOK 88.1 million in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. This amount includes a reversal of an accrual of NOK 3.7 million related to a dispute with Stranda Hamnevesen KF regarding an increase in port taxes and fees charged by Stranda Hamnevesen KF in relation to the port in Geiranger. Such increases are beyond the scope of the inflationary index covered under the Coastal Service Contract and to the extent that we are not able to pass on such additional costs to our customers, our operating costs will increase. In addition, an increase in the prices we charge our guests as a result of such increased operating costs could decrease the demand for our services, which could adversely affect our revenues. Pursuant to the Coastal Service Contract we are obliged to ensure 34 northbound and 33 southbound daily departures from ports along the coast from Bergen to Kirkenes throughout the year. See "--The Coastal Service Contract requires us to provide certain services and, accordingly, restricts our ability to offer other services that may be more profitable." Accordingly, we are more dependent on the ports along the coast from Bergen to Kirkenes compared to our competitors. Some of the operators of these ports have recently increased certain passenger handling and harbor-related fees. We are currently involved in a dispute with Stranda Hamnevesen regarding an increase in port taxes and fees charged by Stranda Hamnevesen KF in relation to the port in Geiranger. We successfully challenged the increase in port taxes and fees in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal. In December 2014, Stranda Hamnevesen KF appealed parts of the Court of Appeal's decision to the Supreme Court of Norway. If the appeal is accepted and the Supreme Court ultimately decides in favor of Stranda Hamnevesen KF, we could be liable for an amount of approximately NOK 2 million for outstanding fees for the period from 2012 to 2014 as well as legal costs. The final outcome of the dispute is also likely to impact the amount of port fees we will be charged in future periods at the port in Geiranger and elsewhere.

We are dependent on our IT systems and any failure to maintain reliable and effective IT systems may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Our business requires the use of sophisticated equipment and technology systems. We use various IT

platforms to operate our business to business online reservation systems ("B2B Reservation Systems"), our other

e-commerce platforms as well as operational systems used in our offices. Our equipment and technology systems

may require maintenance, refinement, updating and replacement with more advanced equipment or systems in

the future, which is further complicated due to our multiple IT platforms. If we are unable to maintain or upgrade

our IT systems regularly, we may experience difficulties with the adaptation of new technology and systems into

our

existing

operations.

46

We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new equipment or technology, and a failure to do so could result in materially higher than anticipated costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Furthermore, future development of infrastructure IT systems and technology may be further complicated by the nature of our business, which includes ships as well as land-based operations, and the difference in technology and systems we use.
Damage to or malfunction of our equipment or technology systems may require capital expenditure to rectify and cause delays in our operations. Any material disruption or slowdown of our equipment or technology systems, including those caused by our failure to successfully upgrade our equipment or systems, could cause disruption in our operations or delay our services or even force us to cancel scheduled voyages or land-based activities. Such delays or cancellations could (particularly if the disruption occurred during our peak season) have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
We sell our cruise packages over the internet, both domestically and internationally using multiple platforms. Our B2B Reservation Systems and other e-commerce channels are subject to numerous risks, including:
· reliance on third parties for computer hardware/software, the need to keep up with rapid technological change and the implementation of new systems and platforms, including our B2B Reservation systems;
· the risk that our IT systems may become unstable or unavailable due to necessary upgrades or the failure of our computer systems or the related IT support systems as a result of computer viruses, telecommunication failures, electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, or disruption of internet service, whether for technical or other reasons;
· customers or travel agents finding our B2B Reservation Systems or other e-commerce channels difficult to use; and
· liability for online credit card fraud and problems adequately securing our payment systems.
Our failure to respond appropriately to these risks and uncertainties could reduce our revenue through thirdparty agent bookings, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
We engage third-parties to maintain and develop IT systems for our use. If such private providers were to terminate their agreements with us or stop providing services to us for any reason, or if such private providers were to considerably raise the price of their services, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Some of these providers are small companies and their long-term financial viability cannot be assured. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find and retain alternative providers or acquire the rights to intellectual property important to our operations if our current or future providers become financially unstable. To the extent any of these systems, technologies or programs do not function properly and we cannot find and retain a suitable IT provider to help remedy the fault, we may experience material adverse effects on our business that require substantial additional investments to remedy, or which we may not be able to remedy at all.

Breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology and other networks could adversely affect our reputation and operations and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Our ability to increase revenues and control costs, as well as our ability to serve guests most effectively

depends in part on the reliability of our sophisticated technologies and system networks. We use

communications, information technology and other systems to manage our inventory of available cabins and to

set pricing in order to maximize our revenue yields and optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of our

operations. Gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive

information, corrupting data, causing operational disruptions and other cyber-related risks could adversely impact

our guest services and satisfaction, employee relationships, business plans and our reputation and we could

experience lost revenues, fines or lawsuits. Also, customers may be unwilling to provide us with their data, which

may adversely affect our direct marketing efforts. In addition, the operation and maintenance of these systems is

in

some

47

cases dependent on third-party technologies and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. While we have invested and continue to invest in technologies and other security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to mitigate these risks, these measures cannot completely insulate us from disruptions that could result in adverse effects on our operations and results of operations. These potential disruptions and cyberattacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, in particular on customer demand and pricing for our services, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Our principal office is located in Tromsø, Norway. Although we have developed disaster recovery and similar contingency plans, actual or threatened natural disasters or similar events in Norway may cause disturbances to our information technology and have a material impact on our business continuity, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and land-based employees and other employee relation issues may adversely affect our financial results.
A large number of our employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. As of September 30, 2014, we were subject to five collective bargain agreements, including three collective bargain agreements for maritime crew and two collective bargaining agreements for land-based employees. One agreement was renegotiated in the end of 2013 and is scheduled to expire in the end of December 2017. The other four agreements were renegotiated in 2014 and are scheduled to expire in April 2016. Such collective bargaining agreements cannot be renegotiated prior to their expiry.
In addition, pursuant to our Coastal Service Contract, all our employees who are directly engaged in fulfilling our obligations under our Coastal Service Contract must have employment terms equal to or better than the terms set out in national collective bargaining agreements for the relevant type of employee and common market practice. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage on our ships. We may also be subject to or affected by work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
The loss of key personnel or our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.
We rely upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion, integrity and good faith of our senior management team and other key personnel, who have extensive experience and knowledge of the cruise, transportation and travel industry. In addition, in crewing our ships, we require technically skilled employees with specialized training who can perform physically demanding work. Our success and ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing customer preferences and tastes depends, in part, on our attracting and retaining high quality employees in our management, and other key functions. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other key employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our business strategy. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future. For example, sea officers and other key onboard personnel have been difficult to source in recent years as the industry has been experiencing a shortage due to increased ship capacity and a trend away from maritime education in some countries. Increased cruise capacity could impact our ability to retain and attract qualified crew, including officers, at competitive rates and, therefore increase our shipboard employee costs.
The members of our senior management team have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. See "Management" for additional information about our management. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could also adversely affect us. We are not protected by key man or similar life insurance covering members of our senior management. We have employment agreements with our executive officers, but these agreements do not guarantee that any given executive will remain with us. The loss of services of any of the key members of our management team or other personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
48

We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue.
We are directly and indirectly subject to various international and national laws, regulations, treaties and employee union agreements related to, among other things, the environment, health, safety, security and employment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages.

Many aspects of the cruise, sea transportation and vacation industries are regulated by national legislators and authorities (like the Norwegian Maritime Directorate ("NMD")), the European Union and international treaties, such as:
· the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ("SOLAS"), an international safety regulation;
· the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships ("MARPOL"), an international environmental regulation;
· the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers ("SWTC"), an international treaty providing qualifications for seagoing personnel;
· the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue ("SAR"), an international convention covering search and rescue operations, rescue co-ordination and operating procedures to be followed in the event of emergencies or alerts during search and rescue operations;
· the International Safety Management Code ("ISM"), an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for prevention of pollution;
· the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code ("ISPS"), an international standard for enhancing the security onboard ships and in port facilities; and
· the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments ("BWM"), an international convention intended to prevent the spread of harmful aquatic organisms from one region to another.

Compliance with such laws and regulations may entail significant expenses for ship modification and changes in operating procedures, which could adversely impact our operations and financial results. In addition, we may incur costs, such as cleanup costs, fines and other sanctions, and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations, including in connection with any release or disposal of or exposure to hazardous substances or wastes.

We also have to comply with complex ship registration requirements. For example, for the past 10 years, we have been involved in ongoing discussions with the NMD regarding whether our ships should be classified as "car ferries" or "passenger ships" pursuant to the 305 Classification. The two classifications are subject to different regulatory requirements regarding safety and have separate minimum capacity requirements. The discussion concerns the classification of our single compartment ships built prior to the time the current requirements came into effect and we have sought to have our ships re-classified as "passenger ships." If a reclassification of these ships as "passenger ships" is not approved, we may be required to reduce the passenger and crew count permitted to be transported on these ships. Alternatively, if the ships are classified as "car ferries," we could be required to redesign our ships, with estimated future rebuild costs of NOK 2.0 million to NOK 20.0 million per ship. The ongoing discussions with the NMD are related to the technical design solutions for these design modifications.

One of our ships, MS Richard With, has already been redesigned at a cost of NOK 18.7 million in 2013 and

NOK 3.2 million in 2014 and approved by the NMD. For our other single compartment ships: MS Polarlys, MS

Nordlys, MS Nordkapp, MS Kong Harald, MS Nordnorge and MS Vesterålen, we have proposed alternative

modifications to improve safety levels and cargo utilization that can be undertaken at a lower cost compared to

the modifications we have made to MS Richard With. If we carry out our proposed modifications while our ships

are in service, as we intend to, we could experience a decrease in our cargo revenues while the work is

continuing. We currently expect capital expenditure in 2015 in relation to the modification of MS Polarlys, MS

Nordlys,

MS

Nordkapp,

MS

Kong

49

Harald, MS Nordnorge and MS Vesterålen in an aggregate amount in the range of approximately NOK 80 million to NOK 90 million, depending on the agreement we reach with the NMD. However, we expect that such capital expenditure would increase to an aggregate amount of approximately NOK 118 million and could require extended dry-docking times for each ship, possibly during our peak season, if the NMD does not agree to our alternative modifications and we are required to undertake modifications on all our single compartment ships that are similar in scope to the modifications we made to MS Richard With.
Our single compartment ships are required to be reclassified as "passenger ships" under the 305 Classification before October 2015, which, among other things, requires compliance with SOLAS requirements for such vessels. See "Business--Legal and Regulatory--Registration of Our Ships."
Environmental, health, safety, security and employment issues within the cruise, sea transportation and vacation industries are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. Accordingly, new legislation, regulations or treaties, or changes thereto, could impact our operations and would likely subject us to increased compliance costs in the future. We are required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, training of our crew and land-based employees may become more time consuming and may increase our operating costs due to increasing regulatory and other requirements. Further, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, injunctions or seizures of assets.

Our sea based operations depend on our ability to renew our annual ISM compliance certificates for our ships and compliance with the annual audit by the NMD.
In order to continue our ship operations, and to evidence our compliance with the IMO International Safety Management Code ("ISM Code"), our ships are required to undergo an annual inspection in order to obtain a renewed passenger ship safety certificate issued by the NMD. Our passenger ship safety certificate is subject to annual review of compliance conducted by the NMD, during which the NMD may identify items which need to be improved or addressed for us to operate in compliance with the ISM Code. Furthermore our business related to ship operations are subject to an annual review by NMD in order to obtain a document of compliance. During such audits the NMD may identify items which need to be improved or addressed for us to operate in compliance with the ISM Code.
To the extent that our ships or our operations do not comply with the required standards, we may be required to incur additional expenses in order to conduct work required to obtain the passenger ship safety certificate and the document of compliance, or we may not receive such certificates or document of compliance at all. For example in 2013, we were required to improve and make changes to our safety, accident and incident reporting procedures, and to address concerns with respect to some of our life boats on our ships, which were discovered to be prone to water intrusion. While carrying out the necessary actions, we received an interim document of compliance covering the period until we completed the required improvements to the satisfaction of the NMD. As a result, we experienced a two-month delay in renewing such document of compliance and we had to incur additional costs with respect to implementing the improvements specified by the NMD. We did not experience a similar delay in renewing our document of compliance in 2014. A significant delay in receiving such certification or loss of the certification could result in a suspension of our ship operations until we receive the necessary certificates, which, in turn, would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Terrorist acts, acts of piracy, armed conflict and threats thereof, and other international events impacting the security of travel could adversely affect the demand for our services.

Demand for our service options has been and is expected to continue to be affected by the public's attitude

towards the safety and security of travel. Factors including, but not limited to, past acts of terrorism and threats of

additional terrorist attacks, acts of piracy, threat or possibility of hostilities, the issuance of travel advisories by

national governments, other geo-political uncertainties and general concerns over the safety and security aspects

of traveling have had and may have in the future an adverse effect on tourism, travel, pricing in the travel and

vacation industry and the availability of air service and other forms of transition. Decreases in demand and

reduced

pricing

in

response

to

such

50

decreased demand would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects by reducing our profitability.
These types of events could also impact our ability to source qualified employees at competitive costs and, therefore, increase our shipboard crew costs.
Adverse incidents affecting the health of our guests and crew, including spread of contagious diseases and viral outbreaks, could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability.
Public perception about the safety of travel and adverse publicity related to guests or crew illness, such as incidents of H1N1, Ebola virus, stomach flu, or other contagious diseases, may impact demand for our services. If any wide-ranging health scare should occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would likely be adversely affected.
In particular, our ability to effectively and efficiently operate shipboard and shore side activities may be impacted by widespread public health issues/illnesses or health warnings resulting in, among other things, reduced demand for our services and cancellations and employee absenteeism that could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. We have implemented training and ship cleaning protocols to limit the spread of contagious diseases, but such actions may not be sufficient to fully mitigate this risk. For example, in July 2014 we became aware that a guest sailing on one of our ships had been diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease. In response, we implemented a testing and sanitation program on all of our ships in close cooperation with Norwegian government experts in order to determine if there was a presence of Legionnaires' disease onboard our ships. In this process we detected the presence of bacteria in the fresh water system onboard four of our ships. We subsequently installed water treatment equipment on such ships in order to prevent a reoccurrence of this and certain other diseases, and we intend to install water treatment equipment onboard all our ships to prevent any future outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease. Such outbreaks of disease could, among other things, disrupt our ability to embark and disembark guests and crew from our ships or conduct our land-based services, disrupt air travel to and from ports, increase costs for prevention and treatment and adversely affect our supply chain. This could also adversely impact demand for our services in areas unaffected by such an outbreak.
Litigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and damage our reputation.
As a result of any ship related or other incidents resulting from our operations, litigation claims, enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations may be asserted or brought against us, including, but not limited to, those arising from personal injury, loss of life, loss of or damage to personal property, business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding area. Such claims, enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations could lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in significant awards or settlements to plaintiffs and civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, which could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operation and financial position. For example, guests falling ill or sustaining injury while travelling with us may feel mistreated or not appropriately taken care of and guests impacted by expedition cancellations or port cancellations may seek compensation from us. See "Business--Legal and Regulatory--Litigation." We may also incur costs both in defending against any claims, actions and investigations and the time and attention of our management may also be consumed in defending such claims, actions and investigations. For example, in 2011, the EFTA Surveillance Authority ("ESA") found that the Norwegian government had provided us with unlawful state aid under the Former Coastal Service Contract, and we, accordingly, were ordered to repay an amount of NOK 143.4 million (comprising of NOK 35.0 million in 2011 and NOK 108.4 million in 2012) to the Norwegian government. ESA has recently made several inquiries about our current Coastal Service Contract on the basis of third-party complaints alleging that we have received unlawful state aid in connection with the contract. We have, and may in the future, incur costs in cooperating with ESA's requests for information and otherwise defending our position in connection with the ongoing ESA state aid investigation. In addition if the ESA commences an official proceeding and finds that unlawful state aid has been granted to Hurtigruten, we may be required to modify our current practices, to agree to new terms and conditions or to pay a settlement amount, fee or penalty, in an amount representing the amount, which could be significant, of the illegal state aid received as determined by the ESA, plus interest, any of which may adversely impact our operations and financial position. In
51

addition, such claims, enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations resulting from our operations could damage our reputation and brand.

Our insurance may be insufficient and, due to factors beyond our control or a claim by us, our insurance premiums may increase significantly, which may adversely affect our financial results. Also, our decisions to self-insure against various risks or our inability to obtain insurance for certain risks at reasonable rates could result in higher expenses or lower revenues.
Insurance of our ships and our cruise and transportation activities is an important element of our business. We seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates. We believe that our current coverage is adequate to protect us against most of the significant risks involved in the conduct of our business. See "Business--Insurance." However, certain risks, such as risks associated with the threat of terrorism, are not insurable and we self-insure against such risks. In addition, we may choose higher deductibles to insure against risks we consider more remote in order to minimize the cost of our insurance policies. We do not maintain separate funds or otherwise set aside reserves to cover losses or claims by third parties. Therefore, if an uninsured loss were to occur, we could experience significant disruption to our operations, suffer significant losses and be required to make significant payments for which we would not be compensated, any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
Even when insured, there can be no assurance that all risks are fully insured against or that any particular claim will be fully paid. In addition, the carriers with which we hold our policies may go out of business, or may be otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations.
Insurance costs may increase substantially in the future. Significant incidents followed by significant insurance claims could result in higher insurance premiums commencing on the policy renewal dates or the inability to obtain coverage. Insurance costs may also be affected by natural catastrophes, fear of terrorism, and intervention by the government or a decrease in the number of insurance carriers. In addition, we have been and continue to be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on our own claim records, but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity coverage for tort liability. Our payment of these calls and increased premiums could result in significant expenses to us which could reduce our cash flows. If we were to sustain significant losses in the future, our ability to obtain insurance coverage or coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We rely on scheduled commercial airline services for guest connections, and increases in the price of, or major changes or reductions in, commercial airline services could undermine our customer base and have an adverse effect on our profitability.
Many of our guests and crew members depend on scheduled or chartered commercial airline services to transport them to or from airports near the ports where our cruises embark and disembark. Increases in the price of airfare, due to increases in aviation fuel prices or other factors, would increase the overall vacation cost to our customers and may adversely affect demand for our services. Changes in commercial airline services as a result of strikes, labor unrest, adverse weather conditions, consolidation of carriers, or other events or the lack of availability due to schedule changes, such as Lufthansa's decision in 2014 to discontinue its flight service from Frankfurt to Bergen, or a high level of airline bookings, could adversely affect our ability to deliver guests and crew to or from our ships and Spitsbergen and increase our costs which would, in turn, have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

If the amount of sales made through third-party internet travel intermediaries increases significantly, we may experience difficulty in maintaining consumer loyalty to our brand.

We have seen a shift in booking our services from traditional to online channels. Accordingly, we derive a

portion of our business from internet travel intermediaries, most of which devote equal space and attention to all

the service operators listed on their websites. These parties generally sell and market our services on a non-

exclusive basis. Our competitors may offer such agents higher commissions and incentives to encourage them to

recommend

other

vacations

and

services

over

ours.

52

In addition, various websites publish user reviews based upon personal testimonies, including photos that have not been vetted or verified. Although we monitor online reviews of our services through a number of sites such as Cruisecritic and TripAdvisor, we have little control over the way in which our services are portrayed through these third-party sites. Our services may be categorized according to the search criteria deemed appropriate by the travel intermediaries and may be grouped together with other services that are made to look more desirable. Some internet travel intermediaries may emphasize factors such as price or general indicators of quality for example, "four-star high-end cruise" at the expense of brand identification. Such measures are aimed at developing customer loyalty with respect to the reservation system used rather than to our brand. If sales made through internet travel intermediaries increase significantly and consumers develop stronger loyalties to these intermediaries rather than to our brand, we may experience a decline in customer loyalty and repeat business and consequently, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed.
Conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks.
We operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence. Operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks. Examples include political risks and risks of increase in duties and taxes, changes in laws and policies affecting the cruise, transportation or vacation industries, or governing the operations of foreign-based companies. Demand for our services is also influenced by geopolitical events. Unfavorable conditions, such as cross-border conflicts, civil unrest and governmental changes, especially in regions with popular ports of call, can undermine consumer demand and/or pricing for itineraries featuring these ports.
Additional risks include imposition of trade barriers, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries, and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures, including value added taxes. If we are unable to address these risks adequately, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.
Finally, we are exposed to risks related to anti-bribery laws. We have implemented safeguards and policies to prevent violations of various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. If employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions, or severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties.
We rely on third-party providers of various services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.
In order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies, we outsource to third-party vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses, such as operation of a large part of our information technology systems including all hosting services and technical services for our B2B Reservation System. Certain of our IT functions, such as our onboard internal helpdesk, are operated by third-party service providers and we are subject to the risk and that a failure to adequately monitor such providers' compliance with a service agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us. There is also a risk the confidentiality, privacy and/or security of data held by third parties or communicated over third-party networks or platforms could become compromised.
If our services are delayed or cancelled, we may need to re-route our guests to other ports of call or cancel their bookings. As a result, we may face difficulty in maintaining consumer loyalty to our brand and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.
Our services may be delayed, cancelled or disrupted due to conditions that are beyond our control. For example, if there are delays in the operations of the ports of call or if other ships staying in the port are delayed, we may not be able to moor alongside the pier and, as a result, our scheduled service may be delayed or we may be required to cancel stops or re-route our services. In addition, a
53

delay at one port may result in ongoing delays to the remainder of our route and scheduled stops at other ports. Furthermore, as our MS Fram segment offers activities and voyages to remote Polar areas, where medical assistance is not immediately available, we are exposed to the risk of re-routing our itineraries due to medical emergencies onboard.
As a result of re-routing or delays in our services, we may need to direct our guests to our other ports of call or cancel their bookings. In addition, such incidents may prevent or discourage our guests from selecting our services altogether and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.
From time to time, we may provide assistance to other ships in distress, which may result in delays, deviations and disruptions to our service.
Pursuant to the applicable statutory requirements of SOLAS, the master of a ship at sea, which is in a position to be able to provide assistance, on receiving a signal from any source that persons are in distress at sea, is bound to proceed with all speed to their assistance. Thus, in case of an emergency, to the extent possible, we are bound to provide immediate assistance to other ships in distress at sea. In such case, we may need to re-route or substantially deviate from our itinerary, which may result in delays, deviations and disruptions to our service. As a result, we would also have to cancel or re-book transportation to or from the ports of call for our guests, which may cause disruption to our service and result in dissatisfaction among our guests.
The aging of our fleet may result in increased operating costs in the future, which could adversely affect our earnings.
As of September 30, 2014, our fleet of 12 ships had an average age of 20 years and included one ship, MS Lofoten that was over 50 years old. In general, the cost of maintaining a ship in good operating condition increases with the age of the ship. As our fleet ages, we will incur increased costs. Older ships, such as the MS Lofoten, may require longer and more expensive dry-dockings, resulting in more off-hire days and reduced revenue. Older ships are typically less fuel efficient and more costly to maintain than more recently constructed ships due to improvements in engine technology. Governmental regulations and safety or other equipment standards related to the age of a ship may also require expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment to our ships and may restrict the type of activities in which our ships may engage. We cannot assure you that, as our ships age, market conditions will justify such expenditures or will enable us to profitably operate our older ships.
Governments could requisition our ships during a period of war or emergency, resulting in loss of earnings.
A government of the jurisdiction where one or more of our ships are registered could requisition for title or seize our ships for a period of war or emergency. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a ship and becomes its owner. Also, a government could requisition our ships for hire. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a ship and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency, although governments may elect to requisition ships in other circumstances. Although we would expect to be entitled to compensation in the event of a requisition of one or more of our ships, the amount and timing of payment, if any, would be uncertain. Government requisition of one or more of our ships may cause us to breach covenants in certain of our credit facilities, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Maritime claimants could arrest our ships, which could interrupt our cash flows.
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a ship, shippers and receivers of cargo, labor unions or other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a ship for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages, including, in some jurisdictions, for debts incurred by previous owners. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien-holder may enforce its lien by arresting a ship. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our ships, if such arrest or attachment is not timely discharged, could cause us to breach covenants in certain of our credit facilities, could interrupt our cash flows and could require us to pay large sums of money to have the arrest or attachment lifted.
54

Risks Related to our Financial Profile
Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees.
We have a significant amount of outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of September 30, 2014, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions and the Refinancing Transactions, including the issuance of the Notes and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in "Use of Proceeds," we would have had total debt of NOK 4,005.2 million and 34.2 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility. See "Capitalization."
Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations and for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:
· making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debts and liabilities;
· increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;
· requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our free cash flow to the payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;
· limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate;
· placing us at a disadvantage to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged;
· restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or pursuing certain business opportunities; and
· limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.
Any of the foregoing or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes.

Despite our significant leverage, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.
We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including secured indebtedness and additional indebtedness drawn under our Revolving Credit Facility. Although the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries' existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. Increases in our total indebtedness could also lead to a downgrade of the ratings assigned to the Group or the Notes, which could negatively affect their trading price. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute "indebtedness" as defined under those respective agreements.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations.

Our ability to make scheduled interest payments when due on our indebtedness and to meet our other debt

service obligations, including under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, or to refinance our debt,

depends on our future operating and financial performance, which will be affected by our ability to successfully

implement our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors,

many of which are beyond our control, as well as those factors discussed in these "Risk Factors" and elsewhere

in this offering memorandum. If we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, pay

our obligations as they mature or fund our liquidity needs, we may, among other things, need to refinance all or a

portion

of

our

debt,

55

including the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, obtain additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures or investments or sell material assets. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture and any future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of the foregoing measures.
The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, or at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.
Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.

We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities.
The Indenture restricts, among other things, our ability to: · incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock of our restricted
subsidiaries; · create or incur certain liens; · make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of the
Company; · prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity; · make certain investments; · create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to and on the transfer of assets to the Company; · sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries; · engage in certain transactions with affiliates; · enter into unrelated businesses or engage in prohibited activities; · consolidate or merge with other entities; · impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and · amend certain documents.

All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See "Description of the Notes--Certain Covenants." The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, we are subject to the affirmative and negative covenants, including financial maintenance

covenants, contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Our failure to comply with these covenants

could affect our ability to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund our operations, service our debt

obligations or for other general corporate purposes. A breach of any of those covenants or other restrictions could

also result in an "event of default" under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any

event

of

default

under

the

Revolving

Credit

56

Facility Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable.
In addition, any default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries may not be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.
We are exposed to interest rate risk and shifts in such rates may adversely affect our debt service obligations.
The loans under our Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates, generally linked to market benchmarks such as EURIBOR, LIBOR and NIBOR, as applicable. To the extent that the interest rates were to increase significantly on such indebtedness, the related interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow. Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these interest rates, there can be no assurance that any such current or future hedging arrangements will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of interest rate fluctuations or will not result in losses or that our risk management practices and procedures will operate successfully.
Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure
The Company is a holding company and conducts no business operations of its own and will depend on cash flows from its subsidiaries to make payments on the Notes.
The Company is a holding company that conducts no business operations of its own and has no significant assets other than the shares it holds in its direct subsidiary, Hurtigruten, and the Proceeds Loan. Repayment of the Company's indebtedness, including under the Notes, is dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to make such cash available to us, by dividend distributions, intercompany loans, including the Proceeds Loan, or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future indebtedness, or by law, in their ability to make distributions, advance upstream loans or payments under the Proceeds Loan to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each subsidiary of ours is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.
While the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, respectively, limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, such limitations are subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on the Notes. We do not expect to have any other sources of funds that would allow us to make payments to holders of the Notes.
The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the Company's existing or future subsidiaries that are not, or do not become, Guarantors.
Not all of the Company's subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, the Guarantors generated 113% and 101% of the consolidated revenue and EBITDA of the Restricted Group, respectively, and represented 104% of the consolidated total assets of the Restricted Group. Unless a member of the Group is a Guarantor, such member will not have any obligation to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. The Indenture, subject to some limitations, permits our non-Guarantor restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial amounts of additional indebtedness and does not restrict the amount of other liabilities that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.
57

Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, a non-Guarantor subsidiary of the Company, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiary before these assets are made available for distribution to the Company or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary of the Company becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:
· the creditors of the Company (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and
· creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Company or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.
As such, the Notes and each Notes Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Company.
Lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, counterparties to certain hedging obligations and holders of certain other future indebtedness that we incur in the future are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Notes Collateral in priority to the Notes.
The Notes Collateral also secures the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain future indebtedness. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, proceeds from enforcement of the Notes Collateral must first be applied in satisfaction in full of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and under "super priority" hedging obligations and other indebtedness and only thereafter to repay pro rata the obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees, certain nonsuper-senior hedging obligations and other pari passu indebtedness.
The Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement permit, under certain conditions, additional "super priority" debt and additional "super priority" hedging obligations to be incurred. Any such "super priority" debt or "super priority" hedging obligations may be secured by the same rights, property and assets that secure the Notes, on a "super priority" basis. See "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement."
As such, in the event of enforcement of the Notes Collateral, you may not be able to recover on the Notes Collateral if the then-outstanding liabilities under such "super priority" debt, including the Revolving Credit Facility, and certain "super priority" hedging obligations and other indebtedness, are greater than the proceeds realized in the event of enforcement of the Notes Collateral.
Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Notes Collateral.
To the extent permitted under applicable law, and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be secured on a first-priority basis by substantially the same rights, property and assets securing the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations. In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we are permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the Notes Collateral.
The Security Agent may act upon the instructions of an "instructing group," which may constitute either, more than 50% of a combined class of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, certain hedging obligations which do not have "super-priority" and other pari passu indebtedness, or creditors of 66 2/3% of the aggregate principal amount of "super senior" indebtedness (which includes drawn and undrawn commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain other future indebtedness and certain hedging obligations). The Intercreditor Agreement does not require a consultation period prior to the issuance of enforcement instructions. If a creditor group considers that the Security Agent is enforcing the security in a manner inconsistent with the security enforcement principles, it can serve notice on the other creditor groups, which will trigger a consultation period for up to 10 days. To the extent there are conflicting instructions, those instructions given on behalf of the requisite majority of a combined class of holders of the Notes, certain nonsuper-senior
58

hedging obligations and other pari passu indebtedness will prevail. However, in certain circumstances the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging arrangements and certain other future indebtedness secured by the Notes Collateral will have control over enforcement of the Notes Collateral, including if (i) such creditors have not been fully repaid within six months of the initial enforcement notice, (ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action within three months of the initial enforcement notice or (iii) an insolvency event has occurred and the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action. See "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement."
The foregoing arrangements could result in the enforcement of the Notes Collateral in a manner that results in lower recoveries by holders of the Notes.
Disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and creditors under our Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to certain super senior hedging arrangements and creditors of certain other "super priority" indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the Notes Collateral securing such obligations. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any decisions of the relevant instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant Notes Collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such Noteholders. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to certain super senior hedging arrangements or the holders of certain other future "super priority" indebtedness secured by the Notes Collateral may have interests that are different from the interest of holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant Security Documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.
The holders of the Notes will also have no separate right to enforce the Notes Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will not be able to instruct the Security Agent, force a sale of the Notes Collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant Security Documents, unless they comprise an "instructing group" which is entitled to give such instructions, which, in turn, will depend on certain conditions and circumstances including those described above.
Furthermore, other creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against the Company or any of its subsidiaries during such period, and the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Notes Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value.
In addition, if the Security Agent sells Notes Collateral comprising the shares of any of our subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be released. See "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement," "Description of the Notes-- Security--Release of Liens" and "Description of the Notes--Notes Guarantees."
No appraisals of any of the Notes Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the issuance of the Notes. The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Notes Collateral that has been granted as security for the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, and the Notes Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes and the Notes Guarantee.
The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, by first-ranking security interests in the Notes Collateral described in this offering memorandum, which Notes Collateral also secures the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness. The Notes Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Notes Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Notes Collateral.
59

Our obligations under the Notes will be secured only by the Notes Collateral, which will include the capital stock and substantially all the assets of the Company and the Guarantors. No appraisals of any of the Notes Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the issuance of the Notes. If there is an event of default under the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Notes Collateral. There is no guarantee that the value of the Notes Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Company to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Notes Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes.
Not all of our assets will secure the Notes. The value of the Notes Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of the Notes Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Notes Collateral in an orderly sale, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, economic conditions where operations are located, the availability of buyers for the relevant Notes Collateral and any fees, taxes or duties required to be paid under applicable law in connection with the enforcement of the Notes Collateral. The book value of the Notes Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Notes Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, there may not be a market for the sale of the Notes Collateral, or, if such a market exists, there may be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, the pledges, shares and ownership interests of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding because all or part of the obligations of the entity must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the entity.
It may be difficult to realize the value of the Notes Collateral.
The Notes Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of a priority security interest in the relevant Notes Collateral from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Notes Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Notes Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests in the Notes Collateral can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.
If the proceeds of any sale of the Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, investors in the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Notes Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Company's and the Guarantors' remaining assets (if the relevant Notes Guarantee has not been released). Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Notes Collateral or any intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors' rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Notes Collateral.
In addition, the Notes Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. For example, due to the specialized nature of our ships, which have both passenger and cargo capacity and therefore may not be suitable to serve as solely a cruise ship or solely a cargo ship, the sale price of our ships may be relatively low compared to other ships of the same age. Likewise, there may not be a market for the pledged shares or other Notes Collateral or, if such market does exist, there may also be substantial delays in liquidating the assets that comprise the Notes Collateral. In addition, the value of this Notes Collateral may fluctuate over time.
The security interests will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consent or promptly satisfy such requirements. The consent of any third-party may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such asset. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon that asset, and the value of the Notes Collateral may, as a consequence, significantly decrease.
60

The providers of the security interests securing the Notes will have control over the Notes Collateral, and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes.
The Security Documents will allow the relevant provider of the security interest securing the Notes to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the relevant Notes Collateral. So long as no "acceleration event" under the Indenture has occurred, the relevant security provider, may, among other things, and subject to the terms of the applicable Security Document, without any release or consent by the Security Agent or the Trustee, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to certain of the Notes Collateral such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of such Notes Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Notes Collateral, which could reduce the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Notes Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the liens on the Notes Collateral.
There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Notes Collateral will be released automatically, without the consent of holders of the Notes or the consent of the Trustee.
Under various circumstances, the Notes Collateral may be released automatically without the consent of the holders of the Notes or the Trustee, including:
· as described under the caption "Description of the Notes--Amendments and Waivers;"
· upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided under the captions "Description of the Notes--Defeasance" and "Description of the Notes-- Satisfaction and Discharge;"
· in connection with certain asset disposals, if such asset disposal is permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and is not a "distressed disposal," as described under "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement;"
· in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by certain of our creditors in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, as further described under "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement;"
· as may be permitted by the covenant described under "Description of the Notes--Certain Covenants-- Impairment of security interest;" and
· in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance with the covenant described under "Description of the Notes--Certain Covenants--Merger and consolidation."
The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the Notes Collateral may be released and retaken in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes, if the Company has provided the Security Agent with such certificates, opinions and/or other documentation as required by the Intercreditor Agreement, confirming the solvency of the Restricted Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or the person granting the collateral, in each case, after giving effect to the release and retaking of the Notes Collateral or certifying that the Notes Collateral will not be subject to any new limitation, imperfection or hardening periods as a result of the release and retaking. In certain jurisdictions, such a release and retaking of Notes Collateral may give rise to the start of a new "hardening period" in respect of such Notes Collateral. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such Notes Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of such Notes Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes. See "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement."
Certain Notes Collateral and the Notes Guarantees will not be in place as of the Issue Date and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles we may not be required to guarantee the Notes or to grant security over certain assets in favor of the Security Agent on behalf of the Noteholders.
The Notes Guarantees and the Post-Issue Date Collateral will not be taken as of the Issue Date of the Notes. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and Permitted Collateral Liens (as defined in "Description of the Notes--Certain Definitions"), the Notes Guarantors will grant the Notes Guarantees and the Post-Issue Date Collateral within 70 days of the Hurtigruten Tender Offer Settlement Date. In addition, the Notes Collateral may be subject to certain perfection
61

requirements that may affect the priority of the Noteholders' claim. The Company shall not be obligated to guarantee the Notes or provide security to the extent such guarantee or the grant of such security would be inconsistent with the Intercreditor Agreement or the Agreed Security Principles. See "--The rights of holders of the Notes in the Notes Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect the security interests in the Notes Collateral." and "Description of the Notes--Security--The Collateral."
The rights of holders of the Notes in the Notes Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect the security interests in the Notes Collateral.
Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security. The liens in the Notes Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the claims of such Notes if we fail or are unable to take, or are not required under the Agreed Security Principles to take, the actions required to be taken in order to perfect any of these liens. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Notes Collateral or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of the liens in the Notes Collateral to secure the Notes.
The security interests in the Notes Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes.
The security interests in the Notes Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Company under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will rather be granted in favor of the Security Agent on behalf of the Noteholders. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement each provide that only the Security Agent shall have the right to enforce on the relevant Notes Collateral. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Notes Collateral, except through the Trustee who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Notes Collateral.
The ability of the Trustee to enforce the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement may be restricted under the laws of Norway.
The concept of a security trustee, as it is understood under U.S. law, does not exist under Norwegian law. In Norway a security trustee would be considered to be acting as a security agent. In practice in Norway, in an arrangement with a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties, as these exist from time to time, it is generally recognized under Norwegian law that the security agent will be able to enforce the security on behalf of the secured parties and apply any proceeds to the secured parties. In order to commence any legal action regarding a claim (for enforcement purposes or otherwise) against the debtor, the security agent may be required to disclose to the court the identity of the creditors and have the creditors join in or participate as claimants in the proceedings. It has been established by the Norwegian Supreme Court that a bond trustee for an undisclosed number of noteholders can, based on the provisions in the relevant bond agreement or indenture, take legal action against the issuer on behalf of and in lieu of the noteholders without having to disclose the identity of the noteholders. However the relevant Norwegian court would have to examine the relevant indenture together with the other relevant agreements relating to the Notes and this Offering to determine whether the Trustee would be able to act in such capacity.
The Notes Guarantees and the Notes Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.
Each Notes Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. The Indenture provides that each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount
62

that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor, which limitations will also apply to any security created by the Guarantors under the Notes Collateral. For example, under Norwegian law a Norwegian private or public limited liability company is prohibited from providing financial assistance (including placing funds at disposal, granting loans or providing security or guarantees) in connection with the acquisition of its shares or in connection with the acquisition of shares in a parent company (including any intermediate parent company) unless the value of such financial assistance is within the company's distributable reserves and then, further provided, that satisfactory security for repayment has been established, the financial assistance is provided on ordinary business terms and principles and for fully paid shares. The Notes Guarantees given by Guarantors organized under the laws of Norway will be limited to the principal amount of the Notes less an amount of 133.7 million, reflecting the Notes proceeds which will be used to refinance acquisition debt drawn under the Bridge Facility in order to finance the Hurtigruten Acquisition. See "Description of the Notes--Notes Guarantees" and "Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability."
The Notes Guarantees and the enforcement thereof are subject to certain generally available defenses. Defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally.
If one or more of the foregoing laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Notes Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law.
Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor's obligations under its Notes Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of that Guarantor's creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that:
· the relevant Notes Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the relevant Notes Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or the creditor was aware that the relevant Guarantor was insolvent when the relevant Notes Guarantee was given;
· the relevant Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Notes Guarantee or the relevant Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;
· the relevant Notes Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the relevant Guarantor; or
· the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.
We cannot predict which standard a court would apply in determining whether any Guarantor was "insolvent" at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date a Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds.
The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee or other security will be limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Notes Guarantee or other security may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.
63

If a court decided that a Notes Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Notes Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Company and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Notes Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Notes Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Notes Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we may not ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.
The grant of the Notes Collateral to secure the Notes may be challenged or voided in an insolvency proceeding.
The grant of the Notes Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may be otherwise set aside by a court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally specified "claw back" period following the grant. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest. See "Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability."
The granting of the security interests in the Notes Collateral in connection with the issuance of the Notes may create hardening periods for such security interests in accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions.
The granting of new security interests in the Notes Collateral in connection with the issuance of the Notes may create hardening periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the moment each such security interest has been granted, perfected, extended or recreated. At each time, if the security interest granted, perfected, extended or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective applicable hardening period, it may be declared void or it may not be possible to enforce it. In addition, the granting of a shared security interest to secure existing and new indebtedness (such as the Notes and any additional notes) or other indebtedness, as the case may be, may restart or reopen hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. If the grantor of such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding up proceeding after the Issue Date, any mortgage or security interest in Notes Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place on the Issue Date of being avoided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency law. See "Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability."
The insolvency laws of Norway may not be as favorable to holders of Notes as United States insolvency laws or those of another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar.
The Company and other members of the Group, including the Guarantors, are incorporated under the laws of Norway. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to any of those entities would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, Norwegian insolvency law (assuming the centers of main interests of those companies are in Norway and this remains the case, and the companies have no establishments elsewhere). The Norwegian insolvency law may be less favorable to your interests as a creditor than the bankruptcy laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction you may be familiar with, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the ability to influence proceedings and the duration thereof, and this may limit your ability to receive payments due on the Notes. In the event that any one or more of the Company or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. See "Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability."
As stated above, provided the centers of main interests of the Company and the Guarantors remain in Norway, and those companies do not have business establishments in other jurisdictions, insolvency proceedings relating to those countries are likely to be commenced in Norway. However, it
64

should be noted that the concepts of a company's center of main interests and its other establishments are fluid and factual concepts that may change. To the extent any of these companies have a center of main interests or an establishment that is outside of Norway, other jurisdictions' insolvency laws may become relevant.
The key features of the Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are (i) the seizure and subsequent disposal of the debtor's assets, (ii) the assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) the testing and revocation of transactions (including the securing of existing claims) made prior to bankruptcy, (iv) the handling of the debtor's contractual relationships and (v) the distribution of funds (if any) in accordance with the priority rules. If the business operations of the bankrupt company are continued, they are in practice continued at the risk of, and only to the extent guaranteed by, the creditors.
Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened provided that the debtor is insolvent. Both the debtor (by the representation of the board of directors) and a creditor (holding or alleging to hold a claim) can petition for bankruptcy.
There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service its debt as it becomes due (the "cash flow test"), and (ii) the debtor must be in "deficit" (the company's debts must exceed the sum of its assets and revenue, based on real, not book, values) (the "balance sheet test").
During bankruptcy proceedings the debtor's assets are controlled by the court-appointed liquidator (usually a lawyer), on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. The main task of the liquidator is to turn all the debtor's assets into cash in the manner assumed to be most profitable for the estate (the creditors), and then distribute the available cash to the rightful creditors.
All of the debtor's assets will in practice be seized by the bankruptcy estate, and the debtor may not dispose of the seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The bankruptcy estate may also seize assets held by third parties, if these assets are acquired from the debtor in an unlawful manner, or if the acquisition lacks legal protection, or if the transaction can be reversed according to the Norwegian recovery act (dekningsloven). The bankruptcy estate is a separate legal entity, which is authorized to exercise all ownership interests and rights with respect to the seized assets, including but not limited to the realization of assets.
Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value of the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured creditors may, in principle, realize the security, and cover their claims; however, the realization of a number of categories of security during the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy estate (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate has the right, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, to realize the security and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and other holding legal rights in the assets.
Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien of up to 5% of the estimated value or sales value of all assets secured by the debtor for its own debt or by a third-party for the debtor's indebtedness, but limited to NOK 602,000 (which is 700 times the ordinary Norwegian court fee of NOK 860). Such statutory lien is not applicable to financial security (cash deposits and financial instruments) established pursuant to the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act no. 17/2004 (the "Financial Collateral Act") or the Norwegian Liens Act no. 2/1980 section 6-4 (9).
Any under-secured amount (any amount exceeding the value of the secured assets) will be deemed as an ordinary (unsecured) trade claim.
In a Norwegian bankruptcy, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority:
· secured claims (valid and perfected security covered up to the value of the secured asset--either after the realization by the secured creditor itself or after realization undertaken by the bankruptcy estate);
· super priority claims (claims that arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidator's costs and obligations of the estate);
· salary claims (within certain limitations);
65

· tax claims (such as withholding tax and value-added tax within certain limitations);
· ordinary unsecured claims (all other claims unless subordinated, including unsecured debt, trade creditors and indemnity claims); and
· subordinated claims (including interest on salary, tax and unsecured claims incurred after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, claims subordinated by agreement, liquidated damages and penalty claims).
Pursuant to Norwegian law, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions carried out in the three to twelve-month period (and, in respect of transactions in favor of related parties, up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy, such as extraordinary payments of certain creditors, security established for existing debt and transactions at an under-value. The bankruptcy estate may also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently which in an improper manner increase the debtor's debt, favor one or more creditors at the expense of others or deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors' claims, in which case the time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to ten years.
You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes, which risk may be increased if the euro no longer exists or if the Notes are otherwise redenominated as a result of member states leaving the Eurozone.
The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than euro an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchangerelated risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return on his or her investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which an investor measures the return on his or her investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to the investor when the return on the Notes are translated into the currency by reference to which such investor measures the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency other that U.S. dollars by United States investors may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains. See "Tax Considerations--Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences."
Despite the measures taken by countries in the Eurozone to alleviate credit risk, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone member states. For example, an anti-austerity party won the parliamentary elections in Greece on January 25, 2015 and subsequently formed a government with another anti-austerity party. The formation of this new Greek government could lead to the renegotiation of bailout terms or terms relating to the repayment of Greek national debt and concerns about Greece's exit from the Eurozone, which could, in turn, undermine confidence in the overall stability of the euro. These and other concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone member states, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. The official exchange rate at which the Notes may be redenominated may not accurately reflect their value in euro. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these developments and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes.
The Notes may not remain listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Although an application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and for trading on the Euro MTF, the Notes may not remain listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange.
If the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the Company can no longer maintain such listing or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Company may cease to make or maintain
66

such listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or to make or maintain a listing on any other recognized stock exchange.
In addition, although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of any of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Euro MTF, failure to delist the Notes from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another recognized stock exchange, as applicable, may have a material adverse effect on a holder's ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.
There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.
We cannot assure you as to:
· the liquidity of any market in the Notes;
· your ability to sell your Notes; or
· the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.
Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which such Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, or at all.
In addition, the Indenture allows us to issue additional Notes in the future, which could adversely impact the liquidity of the Notes.
We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a "change of control."
The Indenture contains provisions relating to certain events constituting a "change of control." Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase all of the outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Company to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow the Company to make such required repurchases. A change of control would result in a mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness or trigger a similar obligation to offer to repurchase loans or notes thereunder (as the case may be). The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not.
The ability of the Company to receive cash from its subsidiaries to make cash payments to the relevant holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. If an event constituting a "change of control" (as defined in the Indenture) occurs at a time when its subsidiaries are prohibited from providing funds to the Company for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under the indebtedness prohibiting such payments or repurchases to allow the purchase of the Notes, or we may attempt to refinance such indebtedness. If such consent is not obtained or we are unable to effect such refinancing, the Company will remain prohibited from repurchasing any tendered Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We may not be able to obtain such financing.
67

Any failure by the Company to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the relevant Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness. See "Description of the Notes--Change of Control."
The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a "change of control" as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under "Description of the Notes--Change of Control," the Indenture does not contain provisions that would require the Company to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.
The definition of "change of control" contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (if any), taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "all or substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of "all or substantially all" of the assets of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Company is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

If certain changes to tax law were to occur, including changes recently proposed in Norway, we may have the option to redeem the Notes.
If certain changes in the law of any relevant tax jurisdiction, as defined under "Description of the Notes-- Additional Amounts," become effective that would impose withholding taxes or other deductions on the payments on the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, we may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. On December 2, 2014, an expert group appointed by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance presented a report to the Ministry of Finance proposing the introduction of a withholding tax on the payment of interest to recipients who are tax residents of countries other than Norway. On January 5, 2015, the Ministry of Finance opened a public hearing with regard to the report that is expected to last until April 5, 2015. The report does not provide any detail about the proposed parameters of, or exceptions to, such withholding (for example, it does not include any exception for publicly traded debt), and it is not known if the proposal will result in new tax legislation being enacted. We are, accordingly, unable to determine if such a change in tax law will occur or if the proposed withholding tax would ultimately apply to the Notes or to any holders of the Notes. If the tax law is changed and the resulting withholding tax applies to interest payments on the Notes or any holders of the Notes, and if we are unable to avoid the withholding obligation through reasonable measures (including by changing the domicile of the Company or having the obligations under the Notes assumed by an entity domiciled in a jurisdiction which does not impose withholding tax on payments under the Notes), the Notes will be redeemable at our option. See "Description of the Notes--Redemption for Taxation Reasons " and "Taxation--Certain Norwegian Tax Considerations."

You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for United States securities law violations.

The Company, the Guarantors and substantially all of their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the

United States, and substantially all of our business is conducted outside the United States. Almost all of the

directors and executive officers of the Company and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States, and

substantially all of their assets are located outside of the United States. Although the Company and the

Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under United

States securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these directors

and executive officers. In addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Guarantors and their

respective subsidiaries and those of their respective directors and executive officers are located outside of the

United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the United States courts against them.

Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court, actions of the Company and the

Guarantors

may

not

be

68

subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. See "Enforceability of Civil Liabilities."

The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies.
Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes unless and until "definitive" Notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form.
Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to Euroclear and Clearstream participants' accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Notes in global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to Euroclear and Clearstream, as described above, none of the Company, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or the Transfer Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.
Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon any solicitations for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be reliant on the common depositary (or its nominee) (as registered holder of the Notes) to act on your instructions and will be permitted to act directly only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely basis.
Similarly, upon the occurrence of an "event of default" under and as defined in the Indenture governing the Notes, unless and until the Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time.
One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

Transfers of the Notes are restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes.

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities

Act and applicable state securities laws of the United States. The Notes have not been and will not be registered

under the U.S. Securities Act or any United States state securities laws. Therefore you may not transfer or sell the

Notes in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or as part of a transaction not subject to, the

registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an

effective

registration

statement,

and

you

may

be

69

required to bear the risk of your investment in the Notes for an indefinite period of time. The Notes and the Indenture contain provisions that restrict the Notes from being offered, sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to the exemptions available pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act, or other exemptions under the U.S. Securities Act. In addition, by acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor accounts for which it has purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of less than 100,000. Furthermore, we have not registered the Notes under any other country's securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See "Transfer Restrictions."
Payments under the Notes may be subject to withholding tax under the EU Directive on the taxation of savings income.
EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the "Savings Directive") requires EU Member States to provide to the tax authorities of other EU Member States details of payments of interest and other similar income paid by a person established within its jurisdiction to (or for the benefit of) an individual resident, or certain other types of entity established, in that other EU Member State, except that Austria will instead impose a withholding system in relation to such payments, deducting tax at a rate of 35% for a transitional period (subject to a procedure whereby, on meeting certain conditions, the beneficial owner of the interest or other income may request that no tax be withheld) unless during such period it elects otherwise.
The Council of the European Union has adopted a Directive (the "Amending Directive") which will, when implemented, amend and broaden the scope of the requirements of the Savings Directive described above. The Amending Directive will expand the range of payments covered by the Savings Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities, and the circumstances in which payments must be reported or paid subject to withholding. For example, payments made to (or for the benefit of) (i) an entity or legal arrangement effectively managed in an EU Member State that is not subject to effective taxation, or (ii) a person, entity or legal arrangement established or effectively managed outside of the EU (and outside any third country or territory that has adopted similar measures to the Savings Directive) which indirectly benefit an individual resident in an EU Member State, may fall within the scope of the Savings Directive, as amended. The Amending Directive requires EU Member States to adopt national legislation necessary to comply with it by January 1, 2016, which legislation must apply from January 1, 2017.
If a payment were to be made or collected through an EU Member State which has opted for a withholding system and an amount of, or in respect of, tax were to be withheld from that payment pursuant to the Savings Directive or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 2627 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, the Savings Directive or such other Directive, neither the Company, nor any successor company, nor any Guarantor, nor the Paying Agent, nor any other person would be obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any Note as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax. Furthermore, once the Amending Directive is implemented and takes effect in EU Member States, such withholding may occur in a wider range of circumstances than at present, as explained above.
The Company is required to maintain a paying agent with a specified office in an EU Member State that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the Savings Directive or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26-27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, the Savings Directive or such other Directive. However, investors should be aware that any custodians or intermediaries through which they hold their interest in the Notes may nonetheless be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to such laws unless the investor meets certain conditions, including providing any information that may be necessary to enable such persons to make payments free from withholding and in compliance with the Savings Directive, as amended. Investors who are in any doubt as to their position should consult their professional advisers.

Risks Related to our Ownership The interests of our principal shareholders may conflict with your interests.
The interests of our principal shareholders, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests as holders of the Notes. TDR Capital, Periscopus and Home Capital control us. See "Principal Shareholders." Our shareholders are able to appoint a majority of our board of directors and to determine our corporate strategy, management and policies. In addition, our shareholders have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders regardless of whether holders of the Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase our debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce our ability to generate revenue or, if the assets sold are Notes Collateral, could reduce the amount of the asset sale proceeds available to repay the Notes, each of which could adversely affect holders of the Notes.
Additionally, certain of our shareholders are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Certain of our shareholders may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as TDR Capital continues to own a significant amount of our capital stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, TDR Capital will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. The interests of TDR Capital, Periscopus and Home Capital may not coincide with your interests.

(1) The Company was established on September 1, 2014 with a share capital of NOK 30,000. (2) For purposes of this table, the euro and NOK amounts, as applicable, have been translated for convenience only at the rate of 1.00 = NOK 8.1162, which represents the
rate of exchange as of September 30, 2014, as published by Bloomberg Generic Rate. The amount of the Former Facilities presented in the table represents principal amounts excluding amortized debt issuance costs. (3) This presentation includes cash and cash equivalents, of NOK 33.9 million of the SPEs as of September 30, 2014, which cash is not available for use by the Group. The as adjusted amount for the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions reflects our cash, as adjusted to give effect to the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions. The as adjusted amount for the Refinancing Transaction reflects our cash, as further adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing Transactions. Our estimated fees and expenses associated with the Refinancing Transactions, including discounts and other commissions, advisory and other professional fees and transaction costs, are NOK 43.1 million. As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of NOK 336.1 million on an actual basis, which includes NOK 34.1 million of cash and cash equivalents of the SPEs. (4) On January 14, 2015, the outstanding borrowings under the Former Facilities, together with accrued and unpaid interest and break cost were repaid in full using drawings under the Bridge Facility. The Former Facilities were terminated as part of the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions. The outstanding principal amount of indebtedness under the Former Facilities as of September 30, 2014 was NOK 2,011.1 million. (5) We redeemed NOK 500 million in aggregate principal amount of Former Notes on January 26, 2015. The redemption price for the Former Notes consisted of NOK 500 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest and the applicable redemption premium, and the Former Notes were discharged upon such redemption. (6) As part of the Refinancing Transactions, the outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest, under the Bridge Facility will be repaid in full on the Issue Date with the proceeds of the Offering, plus cash on hand. The outstanding principal amount of indebtedness under the Bridge Facility Agreement as of the Issue Date is expected to be 455.0 million, which amount excludes accrued and unpaid interest. The Bridge Facility Agreement will be terminated as part of the Refinancing Transactions. The Bridge Facility accrues interest at a rate based on EURIBOR plus an applicable margin plus certain mandatory costs and matures on December 19, 2021. (7) On January 22, 2015 we borrowed NOK 250.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility for general working capital purposes, as the first calendar quarter is typically a low point in our cash cycle. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility replaced borrowings under our former revolving credit facility, which was repaid and will provide additional funds to cover the cash payments made in connection with the termination of our former interest rate swaps, foreign currency exchange swaps and the majority of our bunker fuel swaps. (8) As of September 30, 2014 other debt comprised indebtedness of NOK 25.6 million outstanding under the Local Line Facilities and outstanding indebtedness of Kystruten KS, which is one of the SPEs, in an amount of NOK 36.8 million under its credit facility. The indebtedness of Kystruten KS is consolidated in the financial results of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries but is non-recourse to the Restricted Group. (9) Total debt excludes unamortized debt issuance costs as of September 30, 2014 of NOK 24.5 million. This amount is expected to be written off in connection with the repayment and termination of the Former Financing Arrangements. We expect to have unamortized debt issuance costs of 11.4 million in connection with the Bridge Facility, 1.3 million in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility and 12.5 million in connection with the Notes. (10) This includes non-controlling interests of NOK 201.3 million in relation to the SPEs as of September 30, 2014. (11) The as adjusted amount for the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions reflects the NOK 1,826.8 million equity contribution to the Company, comprised of (i) an indirect cash equity contribution of NOK 1,639.5 million made by TDR Capital to the Company and (ii) a contribution of NOK 187.3 million by Home Capital and Periscopus.

SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA

The Company was incorporated on September 1, 2014 for the purposes of facilitating the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions and Refinancing Transactions, including issuing the Notes offered hereby. Consequently, no historical financial information relating to the Company is available. All historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum is of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries; accordingly, all references to "we," "us," "our" or the "Group" in respect of historical financial information in this offering memorandum are to Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In particular, this offering memorandum includes audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, prepared in accordance with IFRS, and accompanying notes; and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014, prepared in accordance with IAS 34, and accompanying notes. Hurtigruten's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014 are unaudited and all information contained in this offering memorandum with respect to those periods is also unaudited.

Due to the changing nature of our continuing and discontinued operations in each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the discontinued operations in our audited consolidated financial statements for each of these years include different discontinued operations and therefore are not presented on the same basis. In the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 and in our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the comparative period financial information was changed in order to make it comparable with the current period presented. The financial information of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 disclosed in this offering memorandum have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 and the financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 disclosed in this offering memorandum have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013. The financial information of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 disclosed in this offering memorandum have been derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. As a result, the following businesses were classified as discontinued operations in the financial statements for the periods indicated with comparative balances revised to present the same discontinued operations as in the subsequent period:
· Consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014: Bus Business.
· Consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013: Bus Business.
· Consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012: Charter Business.
· Consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011: Fast Ferries Business. The Fast Ferries Business was reclassified as a continuing operation in the 2012 financial statements and the 2011 comparative balance was restated. The Fast Ferries Business no longer met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation even though we still intended to sell the Fast Ferries Business.

The financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries included in this offering memorandum have not

been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statements, balance sheet or cash flow

statements that might occur as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the

Hurtigruten Acquisition. The Company will account for the Hurtigruten Acquisition using the acquisition method

of accounting under IFRS, which will affect the comparability of the Company's audited consolidated financial

statements with the financial information contained in this offering memorandum. Under IFRS 3 (Business

Combinations) the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred

and the equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair value of any contingent consideration.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent

liabilities

assumed

in

a

74

business combination are measured initially at their fair market values at the Hurtigruten Tender Offer Settlement Date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the acquirer's share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In accordance with IFRS, we have up to twelve months from the Hurtigruten Tender Offer Settlement Date to finalize the allocation of the purchase price.
The following tables should be read in conjunction with, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, our financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The tables below should also be read together with the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The results of operations for prior years or the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future period.
For more information on the basis of preparation of this financial information, see "Presentation of Financial and Other Information" and the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Overview
We are a cruise line, local transport, cargo shipment and exploration tourism operator centered around the Norwegian coast as well as Polar waters. We have been providing our services along the Norwegian coast since 1893. Originally established to provide transportation services linking the south of Norway to the inaccessible parts of the north, the earliest Hurtigruten ships transported cargo and local passengers between ports. As a result of our long-established presence, public service origins and association with a long and naturally distinct coast line, we believe that we are one of Norway's most recognized brands.
Today, our business operations are divided into three product segments: Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast, MS Fram and Spitsbergen Travel.
Our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment is our largest segment, accounting for 84.9% of our total revenues from continuing operations in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. 11 of our 12 ships provide services along the Norwegian coast under this segment, making 34 northbound and 33 southbound daily departures from ports located between Bergen in the south and Kirkenes in the
78

north. Freight and passenger transport remain an important part of our offering, which includes basic transport infrastructure, carrying cargo and local residents across shorter distances, and for which we receive a fixed fee from the Norwegian government each year under the Coastal Service Contract. We leverage this vessel schedule and infrastructure to offer distinct expedition based services and activities to leisure seekers through our cruise voyage products. The ships that we use to provide local transport services and cargo shipments are also used to offer exploration based voyages for leisure travelers, including a high proportion of international guests. Unlike the traditional cruise ships of the Mediterranean or the Caribbean, our ships operate as both "working" ships and "cruise" ships, all while showcasing Norwegian nature and local culture, which we believe is a differentiated offering compared to traditional cruise operators. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated NOK 744.5 million, or 20.8% of our total revenues, under the Coastal Service Contract.
Our second largest segment, the MS Fram segment, accounted for 9.7% of our total revenues from continuing operations in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 and consists of our MS Fram explorer ship, which takes our guests on distinct Polar voyages year-round in Antarctic, Spitsbergen and Greenland waters.
Our Spitsbergen Travel segment comprises our activities in Spitsbergen, where we operate three hotels as well as an equipment store and a host of tourist activities. This segment accounted for 5.5% of our total revenues from continuing operations in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.
Our Other segment comprises a number of non-core operations which have been discontinued. Therefore, we do not describe our Other segment in this offering memorandum; however, unless otherwise indicated, our historical financial data includes the results of our Other segment for the periods presented in this offering memorandum before such non-core operations were discontinued.

Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
General Economic Conditions and Competitive Environment
In recent years, the key economies from which we draw most of our customers have demonstrated modest macroeconomic growth. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, 32% of our PCNs were generated from Germany, 22% from Norway, 14% from the United Kingdom and 6% from the United States. According to the IMF, Germany experienced real GDP growth of 3.4%, 0.9% and 0.5% in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Norway experienced real GDP growth 1.3%, 2.9% and 0.6%, respectively, in the same years. Meanwhile the United Kingdom experienced real GDP growth of 1.1%, 0.3% and 1.7%, respectively, and the United States experienced real GDP growth of 1.6%, 2.3% and 2.2%, respectively, over the same years.
In addition, passenger cruise volumes in the European cruise industry increased at a CAGR of 4.1% between the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2013 according to data from CLIA. The macroeconomic stability in the economies from which we draw the majority of our guests, together with the increase in demand for European cruises, have been key drivers of our results of operations since 2011.
In recent years there has been an increase in the number of competitor cruises operating in Norway; we believe the increase was driven partly by growth in the Norwegian cruise market. According to Cruise Norway, the number of cruise port calls in Norway increased by 11.2%, 28.7% and 5.5% in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

Pre-Bookings

We typically commence our marketing activities for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast and MS Fram

voyages and our Spitsbergen hotels in the first quarter of the year before the voyage. We typically require our

guests to pay a non-refundable deposit ranging from 10% to 30% of the total amount payable at the time the

booking is made. Our advanced customer bookings provide us with visibility into near term revenue across our

business segments. Moreover, the payment of the non-refundable deposits reduces the risk of cancellation. As a

result, in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, 36.9% of our reservations in terms of PCNs were made at

least

six

months

in

79

advance and 37.0% of our reservations in terms of PCNs were made at least six months in advance in the year ended December 31, 2013. As of September 30, 2014, our pre-bookings for the next twelve months in terms of PCNs for the Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment were 13.7% higher than our pre-bookings for the next twelve months for the Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment were as of September 30, 2013.
Depending on the level of our pre-bookings, we adjust prices in order to maximize ticket sales as we approach the relevant travel date.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal in nature based on demand for our services. Demand is strongest for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast product during the northern hemisphere's summer months and holidays. As Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast is our largest segment, this seasonality in demand results in fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations, with 65.0% our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast revenues and 113.1% of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 generated in the second and third calendar quarters of 2014. In addition, we generated 69.5%, 64.1% and 62.7% of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast revenues and 206.3%, 130.5% and 113.3% of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, in the second and third calendar quarters of the applicable year. The first and fourth calendar quarters are weaker periods in terms of revenues and EBITDA. Our "Hunting the Light" product in the winter season was particularly popular with our guests from the United Kingdom, resulted in an increased percentage of revenues generated in the first calendar quarter in the periods under review. The development of this newly introduced product in winter was effective in reducing the seasonality we typically experience in the first quarter of the calendar year.
We also experience seasonality with respect to our MS Fram and Spitsbergen Travel segments. In the case of MS Fram, the first and fourth calendar quarters are strong periods in terms of revenues, and in the case of Spitsbergen Travel, the second quarter is strong in terms of revenue, due to the weather conditions, which are suitable for the outdoor activities we offer, including dog sledding and the use of snowmobiles. However, our MS Fram and Spitsbergen Travel segments account for a smaller proportion of our revenues and therefore the seasonality effects of our MS Fram and Spitsbergen Travel segments do not have as significant impact on our overall results.
High Fixed Cost Base
A number of our largest operating costs, including payroll and bunker fuel, are largely fixed. This is predominantly due to costs involved in fulfilling our obligations to run a year-round service under the Coastal Service Contract and the fact that we have minimum crew requirements driven by safety reasons regardless of how many guests are on board. Although our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast product is seasonal, certain of our costs are fixed and therefore cannot be eliminated in our off-peak season. Although we have introduced various initiatives to better manage and reduce such costs under our Efficiency Improvement Program, a number of our fixed costs are necessary for the operation of our services under the Coastal Service Contract and such costs are not linked to the amount of ticket revenues we generate.
Currency Effect
Our annual financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements are presented in Norwegian kroner. Items reflected in the financial statements of each of our subsidiaries are initially recorded using the currency of the primary economic location in which the entity operates. Transactions in currencies other than a subsidiary's functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates are recognized as financial items in our income statement. Subsequently, upon consolidation, the accounts of our subsidiaries that are presented in the currencies other than Norwegian kroner are translated into Norwegian kroner at Norges Bank's official rates prevailing on our balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated into Norwegian kroner at the average
80

exchange rates for each month, as reported by Norges Bank. Any exchange differences arising are recognized as comprehensive income and presented in other equity reserves. Foreign exchange gains and losses on loans, cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement as financial income or expense.
Our results of operations are subject to both translation risk and transaction risks as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates. Fluctuating foreign exchange rates, in particular as between the Norwegian kroner and the euro, the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling, can have a material effect on the results of our operations.
Our consolidated group results and the results of our non-NOK reporting businesses are affected by exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of the non-NOK revenues to NOK. Over half of our sales from our Customer Reservation Call Center in Tallinn are denominated in euros, as are our sales from our sales and marketing offices in Hamburg and Paris, and our sales from our Seattle sales and marketing office are denominated U.S. dollars. Our London sales and marketing office, which currently services the rest of the world, primarily receives pound sterling. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated 46% of our operational revenues, which excludes losses with respect to our former foreign currency exchange swaps that were realized in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, as well as unrealized effects with respect to foreign currency exchange swaps and foreign currency effects with respect to trade receivables during the same period ("Operational Revenues"), in Norwegian kroner, 36% of our Operational Revenues in euros, 11% of our Operational Revenues in pound sterling, 5% of our Operational Revenues in U.S. dollars and 2% of our Operational Revenues in other currencies, and payroll and other operating costs, excluding bunker fuel costs (together, our "Operating Costs") incurred in Norwegian kroner accounted for 50% of our Operational Revenues, Operating Costs incurred in euros accounted for 13% of our Operational Revenues, Operating Costs incurred in pound sterling accounted for 4% of our Operational Revenues, Operating Costs incurred in U.S. dollars accounted for 1% of our Operational Revenues. We did not incur Operating Costs in other currencies.
In the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we incurred more operating costs in Norwegian kroner compared to the amount of revenues we generated in Norwegian kroner during this period. Our results are also affected by the denomination of our liabilities in currencies other than NOK and by our bunker fuel costs, which are quoted in U.S. dollars. Certain of our operating costs are denominated in non-NOK currencies, including sales commissions to travel agents and costs of goods for flights and hotels that we on-sell as optional extras to our guests.
Depreciation in the value of the Norwegian kroner would generally have a positive impact on our revenues and EBITDA, the majority of which are generated in non-NOK currencies. However, such positive impact has historically been partially offset by the effect of our former foreign currency exchange swaps or by unrealized losses with respect to the currency swaps we have already entered into. For example, the Norwegian kroner generally weakened in the fourth quarter of 2014; we may incur unrealized losses with respect to the currency swaps we had already entered into for this period and we may incur further losses if the Norwegian kroner continues to weaken in future periods.
We terminated our former foreign currency exchange swaps as part of the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions at a cost of NOK 134.0 million, resulting in an impairment charge of NOK 82.5 million. Following the issuance of the Notes, which will be denominated in euros, we intend to use the euros we generate to service our obligations under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent it is drawn, and therefore we do not currently intend to hedge foreign exchange risks relating to such currency.

Price of Bunker Fuel
We are exposed to fluctuations in the price of bunker fuel, which is used to operate our ships. Historically, we hedged this exposure from time to time through quarterly rolling hedges that range as set forth below:

0-80% 0-80% 20-80% 30-80% 50-100% 50-100%

We have also adopted a stop-loss strategy whereby we attempted to hedge the unhedged amount if the price of oil rose above a predetermined threshold. Our hedging strategy for bunker fuel has been aimed at hedging a larger share of our bunker fuel consumption in the near future and a smaller share of our bunker fuel consumption further ahead. As a result, in the past, we have hedged at least 50% of our bunker fuel costs for the coming two quarters. Therefore, to the extent oil prices have declined compared to the spot price in our bunker fuel swaps, any cost savings have been partially offset by unrealized losses with respect to our bunker fuel swaps. Unrealized losses on our bunker fuel swaps that are subject to hedge accounting will result in a decrease in equity and unrealized losses on our bunker fuel swaps that are not accounted for under hedge accounting will result in a decrease in equity and an unrealized impairment charge.

In 2013, we entered into hedges in the forward market on 86.7% of our expected bunker fuel consumption for 2014, distributed with a higher proportion in the earlier calendar quarters of 2014, and a lower proportion in the later calendar quarters of 2014. As part of the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions, we terminated the majority of our bunker fuel swaps at a cost of NOK 95.1 million, resulting in an impairment charge of NOK 78.0 million, and rolled over our remaining bunker fuel swaps. As a result, following the termination of the majority of our bunker fuel swaps, our remaining hedges cover approximately 4% of our expected bunker fuel consumption for 2015. We are currently re-evaluating our bunker fuel hedging policy and may change our policy going forward.

We use U.S. dollar denominated revenues to settle these hedges. Our bunker fuel costs also include taxes and retailers' margins, which apply to the volume purchased and are not affected by our hedging. The taxes with respect to our bunker fuel purchases are a fixed cost component, apply regardless of the bunker fuel price and cannot be hedged.

The price of oil is internationally traded in U.S. dollars, while we purchase bunker fuel in Norwegian kroner. Our fuel bunker costs are therefore subject to movements in the exchange rate for U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/Norwegian Kroner exchange rate has an accounting impact with respect to our income statement since we account for bunker fuel costs in Norwegian kroner and such costs are based on a commodity that is quoted in U.S. dollars. Our U.S. dollar denominated revenues provide us with a natural hedge with respect to bunker fuel costs. A decrease in the value of the Norwegian kroner compared to the U.S. dollar would result in higher bunker fuel costs in Norwegian kroner but also higher revenues when U.S. dollar denominated revenues are converted to Norwegian kroner.

Despite our hedging activities, we are still exposed to volatility in the price of bunker fuel. We experienced a significant increase in our bunker fuel costs in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of an increase in bunker fuel costs. Although we had hedged a portion of our bunker fuel costs, we incurred additional bunker fuel costs of NOK 99.0 million in 2012 compared to 2011. This increase was due to increased fuel consumption, which was partly driven by the fact that we replaced one of our existing ships with MS Finnmarken, which was a larger ship compared to the one it replaced and, accordingly, had a higher bunker fuel consumption.

82

Discontinued Operations From time to time, we identify assets that we intend to dispose. A "discontinued operation" is a material
activity which has either been divested or is in the process of being divested. Our discontinued operations relate to assets for which management at the relevant level has made a commitment to complete the sale and the transaction is expected to be completed within one year of the classification date.
Net profits or losses after tax for discontinued operations are reported separately from income from continuing operations. Results from the previous periods for discontinued operations have been reclassified in order to obtain comparable figures. Therefore, the restated results relating to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012 presented in this offering memorandum are derived from the audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively.
For the purposes of the financial data presented in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," the following businesses were classified as discontinued operations in the financial statements for the periods indicated with the comparative periods revised to present the same discontinued operations as in the subsequent period:
· Consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014: Bus Business.
· Consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013: Bus Business. · Consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012: Charter Business.
In addition, we sold our Fast Ferries Business in March 2014.
Efficiency Improvement Program In December 2012, we initiated our four phase Efficiency Improvement Program at both the Group level
and at our global sales and marketing offices. Our Efficiency Improvement Program is aimed at optimizing our organizational structure, on land and at sea, reducing operational and administrative costs, refining and standardizing our hotel and maritime operations, increasing onboard revenues and revitalizing our voyage offerings by improving the customer experience in order to attract more guests and to further differentiate our offering from our competitors' offerings. The changes we have implemented relate to our overall organizational structure, with the main focus on our global sales organization, our 12-strong fleet of ships and capturing synergies through consolidation of our corporate headquarters.
We completed the implementation of phases one, two and three of our Efficiency Improvement Program by July 2014. We have commenced the implementation of phase four of our Efficiency Improvement Program and expect to complete that phase by mid-2015.
Phase one of our Efficiency Improvement Program commenced in December 2012 and was completed by July 2014.
The key initiatives under phase one included: · A new cost-effective organizational structure, including:
· Establishing our new corporate center in Tromsø. · Centralization and downsizing of our land-based central functions and organization. · Divestment of non-strategic assets. · Optimizing the commercial hotel and maritime operations. · Crew center established with a focus on development and crew planning.
83

Phase two of our Efficiency Improvement Program commenced in May 2013 and was completed in November 2013. The key initiatives under phase two included:
· Optimizing our global sales and marketing offices and marketing functions and aligning our call center organization with our new corporate structure, including: · A reorganized global sales organization, with Nordic sales conducted through our new sales and marketing office in Oslo. · Reallocation of resources in line with our new corporate structure.
Phase three of our Efficiency Improvement Program commenced in mid-2013 and was completed by the end of 2013. The key initiatives under phase three included:
· Centralization and rebuilding our IT platforms and our central reservation infrastructure, including: · Reorganization of our Customer Reservation Call Center in Tallinn. · Reorganization our IT operating platforms. · Taking control of (in-sourcing) key functions. · Upsizing number of IT personnel.
Phase four of our Efficiency Improvement Program was launched in December 2013, and is expected to be fully implemented by mid-2015. The key initiatives under phase four include:
· Measures related to ship operation, including: · Reductions in bunker oil consumption. · Training of crew. · Increased effects from purchasing. · Increased onboard sales.
As a result of our Efficiency Improvement Program, our operational costs have declined substantially since 2012, and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we achieved total efficiency improvements of NOK 96.5 million in connection with the Efficiency Improvement Program. We believe that our Efficiency Improvement Program has positioned us for the implementation of our strategic initiatives and the next phase of development of our operations.
Coastal Service Contracts The commencement of our Coastal Service Contract on January 1, 2012 has had a significant impact on our
total revenues. As a result of entering into the Coastal Service Contract, our contractual revenues increased to NOK 619.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from NOK 325.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, which amount was payable under our former contract with the Norwegian government regarding coastal services, which expired on December 31, 2011 (the "Former Coastal Service Contract").
In addition, in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012, we recorded revenue reversals of NOK 35.0 million and NOK 108.4 million, respectively, due to a ruling by the ESA which ordered us to pay back to the Norwegian government certain revenues recorded under the Former Coastal Service Contract during prior periods.
Key Performance Measures In evaluating our results of operations, we refer to key financial and non-financial measures relating to the
performance of our business. In addition to the key line items of our consolidated income statement, the principal measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast and MS Fram segments include:
· Passenger cruise nights ("PCNs"), which is our measurement of guest volume and represents the number of guests onboard our ships and the length of their stay.
84

· Available passenger cruise nights ("APCNs"), which is our measurement of capacity and represents the aggregate number of available berths on each of our ships (assuming double occupancy per cabin), multiplied by the number of operated days for the relevant ship for the period.
· Occupancy rate, which represents our PCNs for the relevant period as a percentage of our APCNs for the period.
· Gross ticket revenues, which represents ticket revenues, revenues from flights, hotels, transportation, food, beverage, shop and excursions as well as other passenger revenues, including car transportation, travel insurance and retained deposits in cases of cancellations.
· Net ticket revenues, which represents Gross ticket revenues less commissions and costs of goods for flights, hotels, transportation, food, beverage, shop and excursions as well as other passenger services, including travel insurance.
· Gross ticket revenues per PCN, which represents Gross ticket revenues divided by PCNs. · Net ticket revenues per PCN, which represents Net ticket revenues divided by PCNs. · Gross cruise costs, which represents ship operating costs and selling, general and administrative
expenses. · Net cruise costs, which represents Gross cruise costs less commissions and costs of goods for flights,
hotels, transportation, food, beverage, shop and excursions as well as other passenger services, including travel insurance. · Net cruise costs per APCN, which represents Net cruise costs divided by APCNs.
We also measure fuel consumption in liters per nautical mile and fuel costs per liter.
Our key performance indicators are not measurements of performance under IFRS. We have presented these non-IFRS financial measures (i) as they are used by our management to monitor and report to our board members on our financial performance and (ii) to represent similar measures that may be used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of financial performance. We believe these measures enhance the investor's understanding of our financial performance and our ability to fund our ongoing operations, make capital expenditures and meet and service our obligations.
However, these non-IFRS financial measures are not measures determined based on IFRS, or other accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as an alternative to the historical financial performance or other indicators of our cash flow and forward position based on IFRS measures. The non-IFRS financial measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as presented by other companies due to differences in the way our non-IFRS financial measures are calculated. The non-IFRS financial information contained in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC or any other regulatory authority and will not be subject to review by the SEC or any other regulatory authority. Even though the non-IFRS financial measures are used by management to assess our financial performance and these types of measures are commonly used by investors, they have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our position or results as reported under IFRS.

Key Line Items
The following describes those line items presented in our consolidated income statement and other measures that we consider key to understanding our results of operations:

Total Revenues
We record our revenues when we deliver the relevant goods and services. Total revenues comprise of the following:

Operating Revenues
We record certain operating revenues relating to sales of services and travel, sales of goods and other revenues. Such operating revenues include all revenues with respect to our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment and our MS Fram segment and are recognized in the accounting period

87

when the service is rendered or delivered. For ship voyages, this is based on the days when the passenger is on board. Revenues related to ship voyages are accrued on the basis of the number of days the voyage lasts before and after the end of the accounting period. Cash deposits from customers are accounted for as trade and other payables, and if the departure of travel is over twelve months in the future, then the deposit is classified as a long-term liability. Our other operating revenues include revenues for our Spitsbergen Travel segment as well as, in 2011, revenues from our now discontinued Bus Business. From time to time, we also have certain nonoperational revenues, including proceeds received from insurance settlements such as those relating to the fire on MS Nordlys in 2011.
We record certain operating revenues relating to sales of goods, which primarily relate to sales of food, souvenirs and other kiosk products onboard our ships and at our hotels. Revenues from such sales are recognized in our income statement when the customer has received and paid for the goods.
Contractual Revenues Revenues received as part of our fee from the Norwegian government under our Coastal Service Contract and our Former Coastal Service Contract for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment are recognized in the income statement on a continuous basis over the year on the basis of such contracts. In 2011 this also included contractual revenues from our now discontinued Bus Business received under our then existing contracts with certain Norwegian local authorities. Such government contracts are primarily based on a tender, where the company has a fixed contract sum for planned (annual) production. There are specific conditions and calculation methods for the indexation of the contract sum. Any changes beyond the planned production are compensated or deducted, as appropriate, utilizing agreed-upon rates set out in the agreements, and the fees recognized as revenue in the periods in which the services are provided.
Payroll Costs Payroll costs consist of wages and salaries, payroll tax, pension costs and other benefits, as offset by certain
tax credits we receive with respect to a number of Norwegian employees.
Other Operating Costs Other operating costs primarily comprises cost of goods sold, operating costs, including bunker fuel costs,
port related fees, repair and maintenance expenses, as well as commission paid to travel agents and other sales and administrative costs.
Depreciation, Amortization and Impairment Losses Depreciation, amortization and impairment provides for the use of intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment as these are employed over their useful economic lives, taking into account estimated residual values. Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually or more frequently if there are indications of impairment or where the book value may not be recoverable.
Other (Losses)/Gains--Net Other Losses/(gains)--net primarily comprises gains or losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment.
EBITDA EBITDA represents profit/(loss) from continuing operations for the relevant period before the share of
profit/(loss) of associates, net finance expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment (loss)/reversal and income tax expense from continuing operations.
EBITDA Margin EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by total revenue for the period.
Finance Expenses--Net Finance expenses--net represents finance expense offset by finance income. Finance expense principally
comprises interest expenses on borrowings, foreign exchange losses on borrowings and
88

cash balances, losses on sale of financial assets and impairments of financial non-current assets. Finance income comprises mainly interest income, foreign exchange gains on borrowings and cash balances as well as gains on the sale of financial assets and dividends.

Share of Profit/(Loss) of Associates
Our share of profit/(loss) from associates comprises mainly our portion of the profit/(loss) from (i) Green Dog Svalbard AS, in which we have a 50% ownership interest and which offers dog sledding-related tourist experiences on Spitsbergen, (ii) ANS Havnebygningen, in which we had a 50% ownership interest and which owned the office building we previously leased in Tromsø that was subsequently sold in December 2013 and (iii) Funn IT AS, which provided IT services to us and in which we had a 50% ownership interest and that was subsequently sold in February 2013. Associates are entities, other than subsidiaries, over which we exert significant influence, but over which we do not have control and are accounted for under the equity method.

Income Tax Expense from Continuing Operations
Income tax expense from continuing operations represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax from continuing operations. Tax is recognized in the income statement unless it relates to an item recognized directly in equity, in which case the associated tax is also recognized directly in equity.

Profit/(Loss) for the Period
Profit/(loss) for the period reflects profit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations and discontinued operations.

Profit/(Loss) for the Period Attributable to Owners of the Parent
Profit/(loss) for the period attributable to owners of the parent reflects profit/(loss) for the period attributable to our shareholders.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013
Total Revenues
Our total revenues from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 270.0 million, or 9.8%, to NOK 3,018.4 million from NOK 2,748.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily due to our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast and MS Fram segments, which achieved higher PCNs and Gross ticket revenues per PCN.

91

Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 189.1 million, or 7.9%, to NOK 2,574.2 million from NOK 2,385.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The overall increase in our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast revenues was primarily driven by an increase of 4.2% in PCNs and an increase of 7.7% in Gross ticket revenues per PCN. The increase in Gross ticket revenues per PCN was principally driven by the decrease in the value of the Norwegian kroner in relation to the euro, pound sterling and U.S. dollar, among others, compared to the prior corresponding period, as well as an increase in onboard spending. The increase in our revenues was partially offset by lower contractual revenues, which decreased by NOK 14.1 million, or 2.4%, to NOK 566.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 from NOK 580.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The decrease in our contractual revenues was primarily attributable to a provision for the amount expected to be repaid to the government under the Coastal Service Contract, based on the number of days our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships were out of service in excess of the permitted allowance of days out of service under the Coastal Service Contract, which resulted from unplanned technical and operating issues.
MS Fram total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 51.8 million, or 23.4%, to NOK 272.6 million from NOK 220.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily attributable to an increase of 9.7% in PCNs and an increase of 12.5% in Gross ticket revenues per PCN. The increase in PCNs was mainly attributable to the Antarctica season in the first calendar quarter together with increased utilization with respect to our sailings in Europe and Greenland during the second calendar quarter. The increase in Gross ticket revenues per PCN was principally driven by an increase in ticket prices, in the first quarter of 2014 in particular, and a decrease of the relative value of the Norwegian kroner compared to the prior corresponding period.
Spitsbergen Travel total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 23.2 million, or 15.0%, to NOK 178.1 million from NOK 154.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, principally due to increased RevPAR and increased sales of activities, expeditions, food and beverages. The increase in RevPAR is primarily due to a reduction in available capacity in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 due to the temporary closure of one of the buildings in the Spitsbergen Guest House for remodeling, together with higher average room rate achieved for the available number of rooms.
Other business total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased by NOK 0.4 million, or 28.9%, to NOK 0.9 million from NOK 1.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily due to a decline in rental revenue resulting from the disposal of one of our properties in Narvik as part of our Efficiency Improvement Program.

Payroll Costs
Payroll costs from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 44.6 million, or 7.1%, to NOK 668.6 million from NOK 624.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily due to an increase in payroll tax with respect to our crew following a change in Norwegian tax legislation in July 2014 and an increase in the number of crew members on our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships, corresponding to the increase in PCNs for the same period. We also incurred certain non-recurring payroll costs in connection with the implementation of the fourth phase of our Efficiency Improvement Program.

Other operating costs from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 123.6 million, or 8.2%, to NOK 1,637.1 million from NOK 1,513.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Such increase was mainly due to an increase in cost of goods sold associated with higher revenues and an increase in expenses related to sales and marketing activities, which were primarily related to launching new products and increased marketing activities, particularly in the United States. We also recognized restructuring costs in connection with the reorganization of our management team and our Group in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, which included costs for consultants used to temporarily fill positions on an interim basis. The overall increase in our operating costs was partially offset by cost savings in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, as a result of certain initiatives we had implemented in connection with our Efficiency Improvement Program. Such initiatives included standardizing our procurement and purchasing processes and implementing our bunker fuel saving initiatives.
Depreciation, Amortization and Impairment Losses Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses from continuing operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 9.1 million, or 3.2%, to NOK 291.2 million from NOK 282.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, principally as a result of higher amortization expenses in connection with the introduction of the Fidelio cruise management system used in relation to inventory management, onboard bookings and sales. Depreciation with respect to MS Fram also increased following the reversal of an impairment loss in December 2013, due to better than expected results and higher advance bookings.
Other (Losses)/Gains--Net Other gains--net from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased by
NOK 6.8 million, or 92.9%, to NOK 0.5 million from NOK 7.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The gain in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, was primarily due to the disposal of our Fast Ferries Business in March 2014. The gain in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, was primarily due to the disposal of two properties in Narvik as part of our Efficiency Improvement Program.
EBITDA Our EBITDA from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK
95.1 million, or 15.4%, to NOK 713.2 million from NOK 618.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily due to higher PCNs and Gross ticket revenues per PCN with respect to our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast and MS Fram segments.
Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 54.1 million, or 10.3% to NOK 577.8 million from NOK 523.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily driven by an increase in revenue including onboard sales, which was partially offset by an increase in costs including cost of goods sold, payroll costs, sales and administrative costs.
MS Fram EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 39.3 million, or 68.8% to NOK 96.4 million from NOK 57.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily attributable to an increase in revenue, which was partially offset by an increase in costs including sales commissions, and sales and administrative costs.
Spitsbergen Travel EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 5.2 million, or 15.9% to NOK 38.0 million from NOK 32.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, principally due to an increase in revenues from accommodation, food and beverage and excursions, which was partially offset by an increase in costs, including payroll costs and other operating costs.
Other business EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased by NOK 3.6 million, or 79.5% to NOK 0.9 million from NOK 4.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily due to the non-recurring gain on the disposal of two properties in Narvik in the nine
93

months ended September 30, 2013, as partially offset by a decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 of costs with respect to our Fast Ferries Business, which was sold in March 2014.

EBITDA Margin Our EBITDA margin from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased
by 1.1 percentage points, to 23.6% from 22.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2013.
Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast EBITDA margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by 0.4 percentage points, to 22.4% from 22.0% in the nine months ended September 30, 2013.

Operating Profit
Operating profit from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 86.0 million, or 25.6%, to NOK 422.1 million from NOK 336.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily due to the reasons stated above with respect to EBITDA.
Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 44.6 million, or 15.2%, to NOK 338.8 million from NOK 294.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily driven by the reasons stated above with respect to EBITDA, as well as amortization and depreciation.
MS Fram operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 36.5 million, or 89.6%, to NOK 77.2 million from NOK 40.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily attributable to the reasons stated above with respect to EBITDA, as well as depreciation.

Other business operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 1.1 million, or 4.7%, to NOK 24.0 million from NOK 22.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily due to the reasons stated above with respect to EBITDA.

Finance Expenses--Net
Finance expenses--net from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased by NOK 20.0 million, or 11.3%, to NOK 156.0 million from NOK 176.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013.

Finance expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased by NOK 37.4 million, or 15.4%,

to NOK 206.0 million from NOK 243.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, principally as a

result of a decrease in our interest expense due to the repayment of NOK 422.6 million of existing indebtedness

on bank borrowings, including the repayment of loans under our former revolving credit facility, drawings under

our short-term seasonal credit facility, repayments of the facility in connection with our Fast Ferries Business

that we sold in March 2014 and repayments of our Local Line Facilities, in the nine months ended September 30,

2014.

We

also

experienced

a

decrease

in

94

realized and unrealized gross losses of NOK 16.9 million, related to the translation of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency to our functional currency, which is the Norwegian kroner.
The finance expense was partially offset by finance income of NOK 67.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and NOK 49.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, representing a decrease of NOK 17.4 million, or 25.9%. Such decrease in finance income was primarily due to a decrease in realized and unrealized gross gains of NOK 20.2 million, related to the translation of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency to our functional currency, which is the Norwegian kroner, in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.
Share of Profit/(Loss) of Associates
Share of profit of associates from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased by NOK 0.2 million, to NOK 0.4 million from NOK 0.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013.
Income Tax Expense from Continuing Operations
Income tax expense from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 6.6 million, or 28.7%, to NOK 29.7 million from NOK 23.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, which was mainly driven by an increase in our profits before income tax.
Profit/(Loss) for the Period from Continuing Operations
As a result of the factors discussed above, profit from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased by NOK 99.0 million, or 71.9%, to NOK 236.6 million from NOK 137.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013.
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2013 with the Year Ended December 31, 2012
The financial information for the year ended December 31, 2012 discussed below has been derived from the comparative information for 2012 included in the audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Bus Business was classified as a discontinued operation in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 with comparative information for 2012 restated.
Total Revenues
Our total revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by NOK 43.0 million, or 1.3% to NOK 3,305.6 million from NOK 3,262.6 million in year ended December 31, 2012, as a result of a slight increase in our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast revenues and a more significant increase in our MS Fram and Spitsbergen Travel revenues.
Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by NOK 14.0 million, or 0.5% to NOK 2,847.4 million from NOK 2,833.3 million in year ended December 31, 2012, primarily driven by higher revenues resulting from an increase of NOK 139.8 million or 22.6% in our contractual revenues to NOK 758.6 million in 2013 from NOK 618.8 million in 2012. This was mainly due to a one-off reversal of a revenue charge of NOK 108.4 million, which was recognized in connection with the Former Coastal Service Contract in September 2012, and which did not recur in 2013. This overall increase in revenue was partially offset by a decline in operating revenues, which decreased by NOK 125.8 million or 5.7% to NOK 2,088.7 million in 2013 from NOK 2,214.6 million in 2012. This decrease in operating revenues was principally a result of a decline in Gross ticket revenues of NOK 106.1 million due to a 4.7% decrease in PCNs. Gross ticket revenues decreased in 2013 compared to 2012, principally as a result of a decrease in the value of the Norwegian kroner relative to the U.S. dollar and pound sterling. The decrease in PCNs was mainly due to releasing marketing materials later than scheduled in the season, which had an adverse impact on our revenues in the second calendar quarter. Although we subsequently recovered some of the lost PCNs by launching several campaigns for late bookings in the third and fourth calendar quarter, the recovery was not sufficient to offset the overall decrease in 2013.
95

MS Fram total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by NOK 19.7 million, or 7.2%, to NOK 294.9 million from NOK 275.2 million in year ended December 31, 2012, primarily attributable to higher Gross ticket revenues per PCN. PCNs remained relatively stable in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase in Gross ticket revenues was partially attributable to the receipt of additional charter revenue as a result of chartering MS Fram to conduct select voyages to Antarctica during the fourth quarter of 2013, which generated higher revenues compared to the revenues otherwise generated by our sale of individual tickets during this season.
Spitsbergen Travel total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by NOK 7.0 million, or 4.2%, to NOK 172.5 million from NOK 165.5 million in year ended December 31, 2012, principally due to increased occupancy and increased RevPAR, as well as increased sales of activities, expeditions, food and beverages as a result of increased traffic for both group travel and individual visitors. Expanded flight capacity to Svalbard was also a key driver underlying the increase in visitors to the archipelago in 2013 compared to 2012.
Other business total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by NOK 3.7 million, or 31.7%, to NOK 7.9 million from NOK 11.6 million in year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to charter revenue received in 2012 but not 2013, from leasing MS Nordstjernen under a short-term contract in 2012. We subsequently sold MS Nordstjernen in October 2012 and therefore such revenues did not recur in 2013.

Payroll Costs
Payroll costs from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by NOK 22.6 million, or 2.7%, to NOK 806.3 million from NOK 828.9 million in year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs with respect to our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment as a result of establishing a crewing company in Kirkenes, which resulted in lower payroll taxes, as well as the introduction of measures to more efficiently manage staffing of onboard crew and personnel during non-peak seasons, and the resulting decrease in our payroll costs was also driven by a reduction in headcount as part of the implementation of our Efficiency Improvement Program. The decrease in our payroll costs was also due to the decrease in costs related to our short-term charter contract for MS Nordstjernen in 2012, which we subsequently sold in October 2012. In addition, we incurred certain one-off crew costs while MS Nordlys was out of operation for a period during 2012, which did not recur in 2013.

Such decrease was mainly driven by lower cost of goods and other variable operating costs due to a decrease in PCNs for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment, as well as costs savings resulting from our Efficiency Improvement Program.

Depreciation, Amortization and Impairment Losses
Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by NOK 69.8 million, or 18.4%, to NOK 308.9 million from NOK 378.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. Such decrease is principally due to the
96

reversal of an impairment loss of NOK 78.1 million with respect to MS Fram to reflect its expected fair value as of December 31, 2013. The reversal was based on a value-in-use calculation for MS Fram and reflected improved earnings and an increase in pre-bookings in 2013 compared to 2012. This decrease was also due to a reversal of an impairment charge in 2013 with respect to the disposal of our Fast Ferries Business.
Other Gains--Net Other gains--net from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by NOK
5.9 million, or 168.7%, to NOK 9.4 million from NOK 3.5 million in year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to the disposal of two properties in Narvik as part of our Efficiency Improvement Program in 2013 compared to the disposal of one property in Stokmarknes in 2012.
EBITDA Our EBITDA from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by NOK
135.0 million, or 31.0%, to NOK 570.1 million from NOK 435.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to increased revenues from our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast, MS Fram and Spitsbergen Travel segments in combination with costs savings resulting from our Efficiency Improvement Program, as well as lower variable costs due to a decrease in PCNs for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment.
Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by NOK 83.8 million, or 22.4%, to NOK 457.6 million from NOK 373.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to lower variable costs due to a decrease in PCNs and costs savings resulting from our Efficiency Improvement Program, as well as an increase in contractual revenues under our Coastal Service Contract.
MS Fram EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by NOK 35.6 million, or 87.2%, to NOK 76.4 million from NOK 40.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to higher Gross ticket revenues per PCN, mainly attributable to the receipt of additional charter revenue as a result of chartering MS Fram to conduct select voyages to Antarctica during the fourth quarter of 2013, which generated higher revenues compared to the revenues otherwise generated by our sale of individual tickets during this season.
Spitsbergen Travel EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by NOK 7.4 million, or 43.1%, to NOK 24.5 million from NOK 17.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to increased volumes with respect to both group travel and individual visitors, as well as with higher sales from excursions and activities as well as food and beverages.
Other business EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by NOK 8.3 million, or 252.5%, to NOK 11.6 million from NOK 3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to a gain on the disposal of two properties in Narvik.

MS Fram operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by NOK 112.1 million to NOK 132.5 million from NOK 20.4 million in year ended December 31, 2012, primarily attributable to the reasons stated above with respect to EBITDA.

Finance expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by NOK 30.1 million, or 8.6%, to NOK 320.6 million from NOK 350.7 million in year ended December 31, 2012, principally as a result of a decrease in our interest expense due to the repayment of NOK 389.2 million of existing indebtedness on bank borrowings and additional repayments with respect to indebtedness of the SPEs in the year ended December 31, 2013. Our finance expense also decreased due to a decrease in realized and unrealized gross losses of NOK 12.9 million, related to the translation of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency to our functional currency, which is the Norwegian kroner.
Finance income for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by NOK 40.6 million, or 31.2% to NOK 89.5 million from NOK 130.1 million for year ended December 31, 2012. Such decrease in finance income was mainly driven by a one-off gain of NOK 18.4 million in 2012 as a result of the sale of shares in Aurland Ressursutvikling AS, which did not recur in 2013. In addition, the decrease was a result of a decrease in realized and unrealized gross gains of NOK 24.7 million, related to the translation of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency to our functional currency, which is the Norwegian kroner.
Share of Profit/(Loss) of Associates
Share of profit of associates from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 was NOK 10.8 million compared to a loss of NOK 2.1 million in year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of the sale of our office building in Tromsø that was sold in December 2013 and was owned by ANS Havnebygningen, in which we had a 50% ownership interest.
Income Tax Expense from Continuing Operations
Income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by NOK 19.8 million, or 83.5%, to NOK 3.9 million from NOK 23.7 million in year ended December 31, 2012, which was driven by a combination of factors, including the provision of various intercompany services by our Norwegian subsidiaries to our German and United Kingdom subsidiaries, which reduced our overall income tax expense.
Profit/(Loss) for the Period from Continuing Operations
As a result of the factors discussed above, profit for the year was NOK 37.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to a loss of NOK 190.1 million in year ended December 31, 2012.

comparative information for 2012 included in the audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Bus Business was classified as a discontinued operation in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 with comparative information for 2012 restated. However, the Bus Business was accounted for as a continuing operation in the 2011 financial information set forth in the comparison below since the financial information for the year ended December 31, 2011 discussed below has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 and was never restated to exclude the Bus Business. In addition, the Charter Business was classified as a discontinued operation in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 with comparative information for 2011 restated.
Total Revenues Our total revenues from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by NOK
6.4 million, or 0.2%, to NOK 3,262.6 million from NOK 3,269.0 million in year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to the reclassification of our Bus Business from a continuing operation in 2011 to a discontinued operation in 2012, which was partially offset by increased revenues from the Coastal Service Contract in comparison to our Former Coastal Service Contract.
Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by NOK 384.7 million, or 15.7%, to NOK 2,833.3 million from NOK 2,448.6 million in year ended December 31, 2011, which was primarily driven by an increase in our contractual revenues. Our contractual revenues increased by NOK 80.4 million, or 14.9% to NOK 618.8 million in 2012 from NOK 538.3 million in 2011, primarily as a result of the increase in fees payable under our Coastal Service Contract in 2012 compared to the fees payable under the Former Coastal Service Contract in 2011. In addition, our operating revenues also increased in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of higher Gross ticket revenues per PCN.
MS Fram total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by NOK 4.2 million, or 1.5%, to NOK 275.2 million from NOK 279.4 million in year ended December 31, 2011, primarily attributable to a decline in PCNs from our voyages in Greenland and our Antarctic voyages in the first quarter of 2013.
Spitsbergen Travel total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by NOK 27.7 million, or 20.1%, to NOK 165.5 million from NOK 137.8 million in year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to the receipt of charter revenue as a result of leasing MS Nordstjernen under a short-term contract in 2012.
Other business total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by NOK 402.5 million, or 97.2%, to NOK 11.6 million from NOK 414.1 million in year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to reduced revenue from our Bus Business, which was reclassified from a continued operation in 2011 to a discontinued operation in 2012.
Payroll Costs Payroll costs for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by NOK 112.6 million, or 11.9%, to NOK
828.9 million from NOK 941.5 million in year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to reduced costs from our Bus Business, which was reclassified from a continued operation in 2011 to a discontinued operation in 2012, partially offset by increased crew costs onboard our ships and increased payroll costs with respect to our onshore employees due to switching our pension scheme from a defined benefit scheme to a defined contribution scheme in 2011.

Other operating costs from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by NOK 27.1 million, or 1.3%, to NOK 2,002.1 million from NOK 2,029.2 million in year ended December 31, 2011. Such decrease was mainly driven by reduced costs from our Bus Business, which we reclassified from a continued operation in 2011 to a discontinued operation in 2012. Such decrease in operating costs was partially offset by a significant increase in bunker fuel costs following increased oil prices, which were partially hedged at such time.

Depreciation, Amortization and Impairment Losses
Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by NOK 44.1 million, or 10.4%, to NOK 378.7 million from NOK 422.8 million in year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of reduced depreciation and an impairment loss with respect to our Bus Business, which was reclassified from a continuing operation in 2011 to a discontinued operation in 2012, partly offset by a significantly higher impairment loss with respect to MS Nordlys recorded in 2011, as compared to 2012.
We had impairment losses of NOK 31.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to NOK 89.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. In 2012, we incurred an impairment loss in an aggregate amount of NOK 17.7 million in connection with our Fast Ferries Business, which was held for sale. In addition, in 2012 we recorded a further impairment loss of NOK 4.6 million with respect to damage to MS Nordlys as a result of a fire in 2011. In 2011, we recorded a goodwill impairment of NOK 49.6 million with respect to our Bus Business and an impairment loss of NOK 38.6 million with respect to MS Nordlys.

Other Gains--Net
Other gains--net from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by NOK 79.8 million, or 95.8%, to NOK 3.5 million from NOK 83.3 million in year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to a gain from the sale of a property with respect to our Bus Business in July 2011, which did not recur in 2012.

EBITDA
Our EBITDA from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by NOK 53.5 million, or 14.0%, to NOK 435.0 million from NOK 381.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to increased contractual revenues from our fees under the new Coastal Service Contract compared to our fees under the Former Coastal Service Contract, which was partially offset by an increase in bunker fuel costs due to increased oil prices, and a general increase in operating cruise costs. In addition, we recorded a gain from the sale of our former subsidiary AS TIRB, which operated our Bus Business, in July 2011, which did not recur in 2012.
Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by NOK 169.7 million, or 83.2%, to NOK 373.8 million from NOK 204.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to increased contractual revenues from our fees under the new Coastal Service Contract compared to our fees under the Former Coastal Service Contract, which
100

was partly offset by an increase in bunker fuel costs due to increased oil prices, and a general increase in operating cruise costs.
MS Fram EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by NOK 4.6 million, or 10.6%, to NOK 40.8 million from NOK 45.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily attributable to a decline in PCNs from our voyages in Greenland and our Antarctic voyages in the first quarter of 2013.
Spitsbergen Travel EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by NOK 12.7 million, or 287.7%, to NOK 17.1 million from NOK 4.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to the receipt of charter revenue as a result of leasing MS Nordstjernen under a short-term contract in 2012 together with a reduction in operating costs for this segment.
Other business EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by NOK 124.1 million, or 97.4%, to NOK 3.2 million from NOK 127.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to reduced profit from our Bus Business, which was reclassified from a continuing operation in 2011 to a discontinued operation in 2012.

percentage points, to 13.3% from 11.7% in year ended December 31, 2011.

97.6 million to a gain of NOK 56.4 million from a loss of NOK 41.2 million in year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to the reasons stated above with respect to EBITDA.
Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by NOK 157.2 million to a gain of NOK 73.6 million from a loss of NOK 83.6 million in year ended December 31, 2011, primarily driven by the reasons stated above with respect to EBITDA.
MS Fram operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by NOK 6.1 million, or 23.0%, to NOK 20.4 million from NOK 26.5 million in year ended December 31, 2011, primarily attributable to the reasons stated above with respect to EBITDA.
Spitsbergen Travel operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by NOK 12.4 million to a gain of NOK 5.7 million from a loss of NOK 6.7 million in year ended December 31, 2011, principally due to the reasons stated above with respect to EBITDA.
Other business operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by NOK 65.9 million to a loss of NOK 43.4 million from a gain of NOK 22.5 million in year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to the reasons stated above with respect to EBITDA, together with higher impairment losses on the Fast Ferries Business in the year ended December 31, 2012.
Finance Expenses--Net Finance expenses--net from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by
NOK 53.7 million, or 32.2%, to NOK 220.6 million from NOK 166.9 million in year ended December 31, 2011.
101

Finance expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by NOK 112.0 million, or 46.9%, to NOK 350.7 million from NOK 238.7 million in year ended December 31, 2011, principally as a result of refinancing our then existing debt in 2012 with a revolving credit facility and the Former Notes, which resulted in higher interest expense. Such finance expense was partially offset by finance income of NOK 71.8 million in year ended December 31, 2011 and NOK 130.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, representing an increase of NOK 58.3 million, or 81.3%, which increase was primarily due to gain on the sale of our shares in Aurland Ressursutvikling AS and an increase in realized and unrealized gross gains related to the translation of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency to our functional currency, which is the Norwegian kroner.

Share of Profit/(Loss) of Associates
Share of profit/(loss) of associates from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by NOK 4.5 million to a loss of NOK 2.1 million from a gain of NOK 2.4 million in year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of reduced earnings at Funn IT AS, in which we had a 50% ownership interest.

Income Tax Expense/(Income) from Continuing Operations
Income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 was NOK 23.7 million compared to income of NOK 109.1 million in year ended December 31, 2011, which change was mainly driven by certain deferred income tax assets relating to a tax loss carry forwards we had in the year ended December 31, 2011 and which did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2012.

Profit/(Loss) for the Period from Continuing Operations
As a result of the factors discussed above, loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by NOK 94.4 million or 96.5% to NOK 190.1 million from NOK 96.7 million in year ended December 31, 2011.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. Our primary cash needs relate to capital expenditures for dry-dockings, maintenance and refurbishment of our ships, meeting debt service requirements and funding our working capital requirements. The most significant components of our working capital are cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and other current liabilities. We believe that, based on our current level of operations, as reflected in our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, these sources of liquidity, together with existing available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditures and debt service obligations for at least the next twelve months.

The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods indicated. Please refer to the relevant statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for more detailed information.

(a) A restatement in the amount of NOK 2.1 million occurred in 2013 in respect of 2012 figures due to the implementation of the amendments to IAS 19, Employee Benefits.

The principal factors affecting our net cash flows from operating activities in the periods presented are the change in our operating profit, the impact of changes in our working capital, the amount of interest paid and the movement with respect to our income taxes.

A number of our operating costs are fixed; however certain of our costs, such as costs of goods, vary on a seasonal basis in line with our peak season, which typically occurs in the second and third calendar quarters of each year. We also collect a portion of pre-booked revenues at the time of booking and our peak booking periods are from September to October and January to February. However, the amount of revenues collected in advance is relatively small as the amount payable generally accounts for approximately 10 to 30% of the total cost of the trip booked. Therefore, due to the seasonal nature of our business, we tend to have positive working capital during our peak season in the second and third calendar quarters, and negative working capital during the first and fourth calendar quarters (our non-peak period) when we collect less revenues. Our operating costs are

103

generally lower during our non-peak season. However, in addition to our fixed costs, the phasing of certain of our expenses do not track the seasonality of our revenues. For example, we typically schedule dry-docking of our ships during the winter season, and this has a negative effect on our working capital during our non-peak period.
Net cash flows from operating activities increased by NOK 89.3 million, or 20.1%, to NOK 534.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to NOK 445.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 reflecting higher operating results in the period, mainly driven by higher PCNs and Gross ticket revenues per PCN in our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast and MS Fram segments, as well as a decrease in the outflow for working capital and a decrease in interest paid. The decrease in the outflow for working capital was in part due to reduced trade and other payables.
Net cash flows from operating activities decreased by NOK 110.5 million, or 19.2%, to NOK 463.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to NOK 574.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the change in trade and other receivables due to the receipt of cash in an amount of NOK 221.0 million in 2012 in connection with the settlement of a dispute in connection with our Charter Business regarding the payment of our fees by our counterparty and a payment of NOK 87.6 million that we received under the Former Coastal Service Contract. Such payment was non-recurring and partially offset by increased operating profit in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year.
Net cash flows from operating activities increased by NOK 535.8 million to NOK 574.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to NOK 38.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase is primarily attributable to the non-recurring payment received in 2012 related to the settlement of the dispute in connection with our Charter Business, partially offset by the reversal of certain contractual revenues following the ruling by ESA in relation to the Former Coastal Service Contract.

Cash flows from investing activities principally relates to capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, less any proceeds from the sale or disposal of property, plant and equipment and shares and shareholdings.
Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by NOK 70.6 million, or 52.9%, to NOK 62.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to NOK 133.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, mainly as a result of proceeds we received from the sale of
104

our Fast Ferries Business in March 2014 and the sale of a property used by our Bus Business in May 2014, as well as a decrease in our capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures decreased by NOK 41.4 million, or 21.4% from NOK 193.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to NOK 151.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 due to a decline in expenses with respect to scheduled dry-docking of our ships during this period.
Net cash flows used in investing activities increased by NOK 114.9 million, or 96.8%, to NOK 233.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to NOK 118.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, principally as a result of an increase in our capital expenditures (excluding insurance proceeds discussed below), primarily related to upgrading our IT systems supporting the management of capacity inventory and pricing. In addition, in 2012, we released the cash collateral relating to the Former Coastal Service Contract and replaced this security with insurance sureties under the Coastal Service Contract. The resulting increase in net cash flow from investing activities in 2012 was not repeated in 2013. Our capital expenditures (including proceeds received in 2012 from the insurance settlement with respect to damage to MS Nordlys as a result of a fire in 2011) decreased by NOK 78.8 million from NOK 375.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to NOK 296.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013.
Net cash flows used in investing activities was NOK 118.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to net cash flows from investing activities of NOK 101.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to amounts received for the sale of the shares in Nor Lines AS and real properties in relation to the operation of our Bus Business during 2011. Our capital expenditures increased by NOK 131.5 million, or 53.9%, from NOK 244.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to NOK 375.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to an increase in refurbishment costs relating to the damage to MS Nordlys as a result of the fire and project costs related to the implementation of the Fidelio cruise management system used in relation to inventory management, onboard bookings and sales.
We expect our capital expenditures in 2015 and 2016 to be in the range of NOK 180 million to NOK 200 million per year. Such capital expenditure will be incurred primarily in relation to ongoing maintenance of our fleet including minor upgrades to public areas; work on the engines with respect to MS Finnmarken and MS Trollfjord and the propulsion systems with respect to MS Nordnorge and MS Kong Harald as part of our NOx saving projects in 2015; further development of our IT infrastructure, including our e-commerce channel; and the upgrade of our Spitsbergen hotels. In addition to this amount, in 2015 we expect to incur capital expenditures in the range of approximately NOK 80 million to NOK 90 million with respect to the 305 Classification rebuild, depending on the agreement we reach with the NMD. However, we expect that such capital expenditures would increase to an aggregate amount of approximately NOK 118 million and could require extended dry-docking times for each ship, possibly during our peak season, if the NMD does not agree to our alternative modifications and we are required to undertake modifications on all our single compartment ships that are similar in scope to the modifications we made to MS Richard With.

Cash used in financing activities reflects the interest paid on, and repayment of, our previously outstanding debt, including our senior facility, convertible notes and revolving credit facility, as well as
105

the indebtedness of the limited partners in the SPEs in 2011 and 2012 and our Former Financing Agreements in 2012 and 2013 and the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014.
Dividends paid to non-controlling interests relates to dividends payable to the minority shareholder of our former subsidiary AS TIRB and to the limited partners in the SPEs.
The increase of NOK 148.3 million in net cash flow used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was due to NOK 44.6 million of dividends paid to non-controlling interests and the increase of NOK 103.7 million in repayments of borrowings. Net cash flow used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2013, decreased by NOK 96.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, due to a number of factors, including borrowings under a shortterm seasonal credit in the fourth quarter of 2013, which were subsequently repaid in June 2014 and an increase in dividends paid to non-controlling interests in 2013 compared to 2012.
We repaid a total of NOK 389.2 million in loans during the year ended December 31, 2013. Proceeds from borrowings for this period reflects our drawings under a short-term seasonal credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2013. Dividends paid to non-controlling interests relates to dividends payable to the limited partners in the SPEs in the year ended December 31, 2013.
Net cash flow used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by NOK 195.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. In 2011, there were no scheduled repayments due under our former senior facility and revolving credit facility or under the debt agreements of the limited partners in the SPEs. The increase in net cash flow used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily driven by the increase in repayments under our debt agreements following our refinancing in March 2012, under which we were required to pay installments on a regular amortization schedule. Dividends paid to non-controlling interests relates to dividends payable to the minority shareholder of our former subsidiary AS TIRB and to the limited partners in Kirberg Shipping KS in the year ended December 31, 2012.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

A portion of the capital expenditure commitments related to our NOx saving projects in 2015 may be reimbursed by the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise's NOx fund. See "--Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities."
Other contractual obligations not included in the table above include outstanding purchase contracts with product suppliers and payments due to trade creditors.

Capital Resources
We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. As of September 30, 2014, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions and the Refinancing Transactions, we would have had total debt of NOK 4,005.2 million and 34.2 million available under our Revolving Credit Facility.

106

The Indenture governing the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain covenants significantly restricting our ability to, among other things:
· incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock of the Company's restricted subsidiaries;
· create or incur certain liens;
· make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of the Company or its restricted subsidiaries;
· prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;
· make certain investments;
· create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to and on the transfer of assets to the Company or its restricted subsidiaries;
· sell, lease or transfer certain assets including stock of restricted subsidiaries;
· engage in certain transactions with affiliates;
· enter into unrelated businesses or engage in prohibited activities;
· consolidate or merge with other entities;
· impair the security interests granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and
· amend certain documents.
Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. These covenants could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains a covenant, that is tested quarterly, on a rolling twelve months basis, requiring us to maintain EBITDA of not less than NOK 400 million in respect of each relevant period ending on or after June 30, 2015.
Our principal source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is our operating cash flow. Our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which in turn depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors discussed in "Risk Factors."
In addition, we have access to a Revolving Credit Facility to service our working capital and general corporate needs. The availability of this facility is dependent upon conditions, including ongoing compliance with a maintenance covenant tested quarterly, as mentioned above and as described further under "Description of Certain Indebtedness--Revolving Credit Facility Agreement."
Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts, including the Notes, when due or to fund our other liquidity needs.
We believe that the potential risks relating to our liquidity include:
· a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of net income from our operations, which could be due to a deterioration in our performance or a downturn in our industry as a whole;
· adverse working capital developments; and
· exposure to increased interest rates in relation to our borrowings which bear interest at a variable rate, including our Revolving Credit Facility and the Local Line Facilities.
If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:
· reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure;
· sell assets;
107

· reduce or delay any planned acquisitions;
· obtain additional debt or equity capital; or
· restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.
We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our existing debt, including the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives, as may the terms of any future debt.
We anticipate that our high leverage will continue for the foreseeable future. Our high level of debt may have important negative consequences for you. For more information, see the section entitled "Risk Factors-- Risks Related to Our Financial Profile--Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees." See also "Description of Other Indebtedness" and "Description of the Notes."

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risks
We are exposed to various market risks as part of our business activities, which are intrinsically linked to our business dealings. See "Risk Factors." We handle these risks using a risk management system, which forms an integral part of our business process and is a key factor in business decisions. It aims to identify potential risks in connection with our business activities at an early stage, to monitor them and to take suitable measures to limit them. The key elements of the risk management system include the planning system, internal reporting and integrated risk reporting.
The main risk areas that may have a material influence on our business performance as well as our financial position and results of operations are set out below. In addition, we also have exposure to bunker fuel price fluctuations, see "Risk Factors--Risks Relating to Our Business and Operations-- Increases in bunker fuel prices or other operating costs may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and liquidity."

Currency Risks
Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency which is not the entity's functional currency. We operate internationally and are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the euro, the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling. Our principal foreign currency exposures arise from the sale of tickets in foreign currencies and from our capitalized assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, our fuel costs are quoted in U.S. dollars.
We have some investments in foreign subsidiaries whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.
We terminated our former foreign currency exchange swaps as part of the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions at a cost of NOK 134.0 million, resulting in an impairment charge of NOK 82.5 million. Following the issuance of the Notes, which will be denominated in euros, we intend to use the euros we generate to service our obligations under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent it is drawn, and therefore we do not currently intend to hedge foreign exchange risks relating to such currency.

Interest Rate Risks

Our interest rate risk relates to non-current loans and borrowings issued at variable rates, which expose us to

cash flow interest rate risk. In connection with the refinancing of our long-term debt in March 2012, we adopted

a new strategy for hedging interest rates, whereby 40-60% of our total floating rate debt was hedged. We entered

into non-amortizing interest rate swaps corresponding to 58% of our interest bearing debt as of the date of

refinancing of such indebtedness in March 2012. We terminated our former interest rate swaps as part of the

Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions at a cost of NOK 82.0 million, resulting in an impairment charge of NOK

73.7

million.

Since

our

interest

expense

108

with respect to the Notes will be fixed, we do not intend to enter into any interest rate swaps with respect to the Notes.
Liquidity risk
Our business is seasonal in nature, with 63.3% of total revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 earned in the second and third calendar quarters of 2014. The first and fourth calendar quarters are weaker periods in revenue and working capital terms. We have a cash pool arrangement that ensures that part of the Group's liquidity is available to Hurtigruten and also optimizes our availability of cash for the Group and flexibility in cash management.
Credit Risk
Our credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to end users and agents, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. To assess this risk, we conduct diligence to assess the credit quality of our new agents, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.
Sales to our end users are settled in cash or with recognized credit cards. Sales to external agents are made either through prepayment/credit cards or through invoicing. We have procedures to ensure that credit is only extended to agents with a satisfactory credit rating. Individual risk exposure limits are set based on internal and external assessments of credit ratings.
The credit ratings of banks with which we have investments of cash surpluses, borrowings or derivative financial instruments are reviewed by management. Each bank is assessed individually with reference to the credit it holds and deposit limits are set, which are approved by the board and reconsidered if the Fitch, Moody's or S&P credit rating falls below an "A" rating.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and a provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Selected Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions, based on historical experience and various other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum comply with IFRS as at the date of such financial statements. In the future, the adoption of new or revised standards or interpretations relating to the presentation of net assets, our financial position or results of operations may have a material effect on our future consolidated financial statements. For example, new standards relating to the accounting for leases may result in significant shifts between "administrative expenses," "depreciation and amortization expenses" and "financial expenses" in our consolidated income statement as well as between "property, plant and equipment" and "financial liabilities" in our consolidated balance sheet.
We make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within our consolidated financial statements are discussed below.
Estimated Impairment of Goodwill
We perform annual tests to assess potential impairment of goodwill. The estimated recoverable amount is determined using the present value of budgeted cash flows for the cash-generating units. These calculations require the use of estimates to establish the required rate of return for the period, cash flows and the growth factor of the cash flows.
We do not apply a general growth factor beyond expected inflation for cash flows when testing goodwill for impairment. The required rate of return used to discount cash flows is calculated as a weighted average of the return on equity and the required rate of return on interest-bearing debt. This calculation utilizes an estimate of the risk-free interest rate, risk premium, beta and the liquidity premium.
109

Ships Useful Economic Lifetime
The level of depreciation depends on the estimated economic lifetime of the ships. These estimates are based on history and experience relating to our ships. The estimates are reviewed at regular intervals. A change in the estimate will affect depreciation in future periods.

Estimated Impairment of Ships
Where there are indications of such, we test whether ships have suffered any impairment. The estimated recoverable amount is determined using the present value of budgeted cash flows for the cash-generating units. Ships are considered within their segment as a collective cash-generating unit. These calculations require the use of estimates for the required rate of return for the period, cash flows and the growth factor of the cash flows.
We do not use a general growth factor beyond expected inflation for cash flows when testing ships for impairment. The required rate of return used to discount cash flows is calculated as a weighted average return on equity and the required rate of return on interest-bearing debt. This calculation utilizes an estimate of the risk-free interest rate, risk premium, beta and the liquidity premium.

Fair Value of Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments
The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques and information from the contract counterparty. We use our judgment to select a variety of methods and to make assumptions based mainly on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.

Pension Assumptions
We operate both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes. Measurement of pension costs and pension obligations for defined benefit plans involves the application of a number of assumptions and estimates, including relating to the discount rate, future salary levels, expected employee turnover rate, the return on plan assets, annual pension increases, expected adjustments to Grunnbeløpet (the National Insurance Scheme "basis amount") and demographic factors.
We have pension obligations in Norway and Germany. The discount rate used to calculate pension obligations in Norway is based on 15-year corporate covered bonds, with an additional provision taking into account relevant terms to maturity for the pension obligations. Covered bonds are primarily issued by credit institutions to listed Norwegian commercial and savings banks and are secured against loans directly owned by the credit institution. The discount rate we applied for our pension obligations in Norway as of December 31, 2013 was 4.1%. For obligations in Germany, the discount rate is determined based on the interest rates on highquality corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, with terms to maturity approximating to the term of the related pension obligation. The discount rate applied in Germany as of December 31, 2013 was 3.1%.
Changes in pension assumptions will affect the pension obligations and pension cost for the period. Pension obligations are significantly affected by changes in the discount rate, life expectancy and expected salary and pension adjustments.

Income Tax

Income tax is calculated based on results in the individual Group companies. We are subject to income taxes

in several jurisdictions. Calculation of the period's tax expense and distribution of tax payable and deferred

income tax for the period requires a discretionary assessment of complex tax regulations in several countries.

Consequently, there is uncertainty as to the final tax liability for many transactions and calculations. Where there

is a discrepancy between the final tax outcome and the amounts that were initially recognized, this discrepancy

will impact the recognized tax expense and provision for deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period

in

which

such

determination

is

110

made. Please refer to note 18 in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 for more information about income tax. Deferred Income Tax Assets
The basis for recognizing deferred income tax assets is based mainly on the utilization of tax loss carry forwards against our future taxable income. The assessment is made based on management's estimates of our future profits and includes an assessment of our future strategy, economic developments in the markets in which we operate and future tax regimes and our ability to deliver in line with our expectations. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, management has found the future taxable income to be sufficient to utilize the recognized deferred income tax assets. Please refer to note 18 the year ended December 31, 2013 for more information on deferred income tax assets recognized in the balance sheet. Disputes, Claims and Regulatory Requirements
We are a party to, or affected by, disputes, claims and regulatory requirements the outcome of which is to a large extent unknown. Management considers the probability of negative outcomes and opportunities for estimating any loss in the event of such negative outcomes. Unexpected events or changes to factors taken into consideration that have an impact on specific conditions, may result in increases or reductions to provisions. Such changes may also necessitate the recognition of provisions for conditions that were previously assessed as an unlikely outcome or for which it was previously not possible to make reliable estimates. Changes in Accounting Policies
For information regarding recent and pending changes to our accounting policies, see note 2.4 to our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 as well as note 1 to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Our Markets
We provide travel related services in both the market for tourism to Norway and Polar regions of the Arctic and Antarctic oceans and the market for local transportation in Norway.
Tourism accounted for 75% of our revenues in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, primarily in the form of cruise-based tourism. This included total revenues from our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment that were generated from travelers taking trips on our regular daily service along the Norwegian coast from Bergen to Kirkenes. Through our MS Fram segment, we also offer expedition-based cruises to Polar regions in both the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. Our Spitsbergen Travel segment provides land-based tourism services (including operation of hotels, restaurants and organization of tourist activities) in Spitsbergen, located on the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, situated north of the Norwegian mainland.
Port-to-port transportation also represents an important part of the business conducted through our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment, with our regular northbound and southbound service along the Norwegian coast from Bergen to Kirkenes, constituting a key piece of local transportation infrastructure, especially for remote areas of northern Norway. The public service element of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment is supported by the fixed fees we receive under the Coastal Service Contract as well as additional revenues from the transportation of local travelers and goods.
Tourism
Market Dynamics
We believe that the cruise tourism market and the Polar tourism market demonstrate the following attractive characteristics, especially in the sub-segments of the markets on which we focus:
Structural global growth in the cruise market reflecting growing penetration with continued scope for upside
The cruise tourism market is experiencing growth due to increased demand for cruise vacations. According to CLIA, passenger volumes in the global cruise market grew at a CAGR of 5.5% from the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to a CAGR of 3.2% for the tourism industry as a whole during the same period, according to tourist arrivals data from the World Tourism Organization.
112

Europe, which accounted for over 89% of our coastal voyage guests in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, is seeing stronger rates of growth. CLIA has estimated that the number of cruise passengers originating from Europe grew at a CAGR of 7.4% from the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2013.
Growth in the cruise market reflects the increasing penetration of cruises in the tourism market, especially in Europe. Based on cruise passenger data from CLIA and population data from the United Nations, the proportion of the European population taking a cruise holiday more than doubled between the year ended December 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2013, from 0.4% to 0.9%. We believe the potential for future growth can be illustrated by comparison to the North American market, where the proportion of the population taking a cruise holiday increased by approximately 30% from 1.9% to 2.5% between the year ended December 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2013, according to the same sources.
Activity-based tourism increasing in popularity globally
According to the Adventure Travel Trade Association, the tourism industry has experienced a growing demand for "adventure travel," including nature-based tourism and authentic local experiences. The Adventure Travel Trade Association estimates that the market for adventure travel generated approximately $263 billion in the Americas and Europe during the year ended December 31, 2012, with an average annual growth rate of 65% between the years end December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2012. Natural beauty was the most important factor (followed by available activities) for adventure travelers in choosing their latest destination, according to a study by the Adventure Travel Trade Association. We believe that demand for activity-based tourism will increase as the cruise industry matures and travelers seek new and differentiated experiences.
Growing awareness of Norway and Polar regions as holiday destinations
Passenger volumes for Norway as reported by Cruise Norway, have outgrown passenger volumes for the overall cruise market as reported by CLIA. Cruise Norway has reported growth in foreign cruise passengers to Norway at a CAGR of 10.2% between the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2013. We believe that recent growth in our MS Fram and Spitsbergen Travel segments reflects a similar trend for travel to Polar regions. We believe that, increasing access to these regions is also a key factor in increasing demand; for instance, an increase in the number of flights to the Svalbard archipelago in recent years has driven growth in our Spitsbergen Travel segment.
Slowing industry capacity growth creating reduced pricing pressure
According to Cruise Industry News, cruise fleet capacity in Europe has increased at a CAGR of 6.4% between the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2013 and is forecast to increase at a CAGR of 4.3% between the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2017 based on existing ship orders, known ship withdrawals and known deployment changes. This trend of lower capacity growth could help create a more favorable demand-supply balance for cruise operators and result in upward pricing pressure.
In recent years, demand has grown at a faster rate than capacity for Europe as a whole, with passenger cruise volumes in Europe increasing at a CAGR of 7.4% between the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2013, according to CLIA.
Resilient demand reflecting the nature of the customer base
We believe that demand in our industry is relatively resilient during economic downturns. CLIA estimated that, following the recent global economic downturn, the number of passengers going on European cruises increased by 12.8%, 12.5%, 8.5%, 1.3% and 2.7% in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, respectively. We believe that this trend demonstrates the effects of improving penetration in stimulating demand, even during periods of adverse economic conditions.
Competitive Positioning
There is no publicly available data measuring the market share of individual operators in the cruise industry in Norway. We have, accordingly, estimated our market share of the cruise industry
113

along the Western Coast of Norway on the basis of publicly available information regarding port arrivals in Norway, and our internal data relating to PCNs for our own operations. We have used information relating to port arrivals for 2013 prepared by Norwegian local port authorities and Cruise Norway to estimate the total number of cruise nights and have indicated our approximate market share based on our actual PCNs for the year ended December 31, 2013, as a percentage of total estimated passenger cruise nights for all cruise ships in 2013. Our calculation of total estimated passenger cruise nights for all cruise ships is based on the port arrivals data for ports in Norway in 2013, assuming that each ship arriving at a port had an occupancy rate of 100%. The berth data used to calculate the occupancy rate of each ship is based on publicly available information with respect to each relevant cruise operator. We also assumed that each ship made one port stop per day, which therefore corresponds to one cruise night. Our calculation of passenger cruise nights for our own ships is based on internal data.
We believe we are the leading cruise brand in Norway, with an estimated 18.2% share of passenger cruise nights for cruises visiting Norway in the year ended December 31, 2013 and an estimated 24.2% share of passenger cruise nights for cruises visiting the west coast of Norway above Bergen in the same period, according to our internal estimates. Our market share is particularly strong during the winter season, when the majority of our competitors reallocate ships to other regions or dry-docking, while we continue to operate under our regular daily schedule with our Northern lights themed winter offering.
Other leading cruise brands in the Norwegian coastal region include Costa Crociere, AIDA, P&O, MSC and Royal Caribbean Cruises. Several of these brands are owned by the same operators. For instance, Costa Crociere, AIDA and P&O are all owned by Carnival. While we believe we are the largest individual cruise brand in Norway based on our estimated share of passenger cruise nights, we believe we are the second largest cruise operator in Norway, after Carnival, when the market shares of all brands affiliated with each operator are aggregated.
We believe that we have a highly differentiated offering based on providing a trip to distinct locations of natural beauty with the feel of an authentic expedition that allows our guests to get close to nature. We believe that we target a niche set of customers, many of whom would be unlikely to go on a competitor cruise, even if we were not an option. Cruise Industry News categorizes us as part of the "niche" cruise market and estimates we had a 81.6% share of that segment of the cruise market in Europe in 2014. The majority of other players in the "niche" cruise segment operate outside of Norway.
We believe our distinct fleet of smaller ships differentiates us from our competitors (many of whom use large cruise ships with significantly more berths than our ships), by providing a more intimate feel to the voyage and by allowing us to maneuver closer to the coast. We believe our offering is further stimulated by our distinct heritage, our continued role as a local transportation provider, which creates opportunities for our cruise guests to interact with local culture, and our itinerary, which allows guests to visit remote regions in the far north of Norway. We believe it would be challenging for other operators to replicate these features, given the cost and lead time required for investment in a new fleet of smaller ships and the importance of Hurtigruten' s distinct brand and heritage to its offering.
Within our MS Fram segment, we face a different competitive environment, consisting mostly of smaller, specialized operators with a limited number of ships such as Companie du Ponant, G-Adventure, Hapag Lloyd, Lindblad Expeditions, Quark Expeditions and Silver Sea Expeditions. Large cruise operators tend not to operate in these regions due to the need for smaller specialized ships to accommodate landings. In practice, we believe that there is significant variety in the style of cruise offered by us compared to our competitors. We believe that we offer adventure travel at a premium price point, which gives us a differentiated positioning from competitors.
We believe we are also a leading provider of tourist services in Spitsbergen, as we own three hotels on the Svalbard archipelago.

Local Transportation Market Dynamics
We believe that the local transportation market offers the following attractive characteristic: Essential service for remote regions of Norway with few alternative transportation options We believe, our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment offers transportation services that are often the only convenient, public transportation link between southern Norway and the remote regions in the far north. As such, we believe we are an essential transportation infrastructure provider for a number of communities. Competitive Positioning We are currently the only operator providing local maritime transportation services both northbound and southbound along the Norwegian coast all the way from Kirkenes to Bergen, and we are the exclusive provider of services under the Coastal Service Contract with the Norwegian government. We believe that local maritime transportation services along our entire route would be less practicable without compensation from the government, and we accordingly do not anticipate material competition from any new market entrants providing comparable services for the duration of the Coastal Service Contact. After expiration of the Coastal Service Contract, we expect that the government will organize a public tender for a new transportation services provider along the Norwegian coast. Based on the current terms of our Coastal Service Contract, we believe a full fleet of 11 ships would be required to continue to provide the services stipulated by the current contract, and few industry players would have such a fleet, or our long established history and brand recognition.

BUSINESS
Overview
We are a cruise line, local transport, cargo shipment and exploration tourism operator centered around the Norwegian coast as well as Polar waters. We have been providing our services along the Norwegian coast since 1893. Originally established to provide transportation services linking the south of Norway to the inaccessible parts of the north, the earliest Hurtigruten ships transported cargo and local passengers between ports. As a result of our long-established presence, public service origins and association with a long and naturally distinct coast line, we believe that we are one of Norway's most recognized brands.
Today, our business operations are divided into three product segments: Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast, MS Fram and Spitsbergen Travel.
Our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment is our largest segment, accounting for 84.9% of our total revenues from continuing operations in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. 11 of our 12 ships provide services along the Norwegian coast under this segment, making 34 northbound and 33 southbound daily departures from ports located between Bergen in the south and Kirkenes in the north. Freight and passenger transport remain an important part of our offering, which includes basic transport infrastructure, carrying cargo and local residents across shorter distances, and for which we receive a fixed fee from the Norwegian government each year under the Coastal Service Contract. We leverage this vessel schedule and infrastructure to offer distinct expedition based services and activities to leisure seekers through our cruise voyage products. The ships that we use to provide local transport services and cargo shipments are also used to offer exploration based voyages for leisure travelers, including a high proportion of international guests. Unlike the traditional cruise ships of the Mediterranean or the Caribbean, our ships operate as both "working" ships and "cruise" ships, all while showcasing Norwegian nature and local culture, which we believe is a differentiated offering compared to traditional cruise operators. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated NOK 744.5 million, or 20.8% of our total revenues, under the Coastal Service Contract.
Our second largest segment, the MS Fram segment, accounted for 9.7% of our total revenues from continuing operations in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 and consists of our MS Fram explorer ship, which takes our guests on distinct Polar voyages year-round in Antarctic, Spitsbergen and Greenland waters.
Our Spitsbergen Travel segment comprises our activities in Spitsbergen, where we operate three hotels as well as an equipment store and a host of tourist activities. This segment accounted for 5.5% of our total revenues from continuing operations in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.
Our Other segment comprises a number of non-core operations which have been discontinued. Therefore, we do not describe our Other segment in this offering memorandum; however, unless otherwise indicated, our historical financial data includes the results of our Other segment for the periods presented in this offering memorandum before such non-core operations were discontinued.
Our Strengths
Positive industry fundamentals in a growing market
Our business benefits from favorable underlying market drivers, including growth in the tourism market and the increased proportion of cruises in the overall tourism market, particularly in Europe, as well as the increased popularity of Norway as a cruise destination. According to CLIA, passenger volumes in the global cruise market grew at a CAGR of 5.5% per year from the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to a CAGR of 3.2% for the tourism industry as a whole during the same period, according to tourist arrivals data from the World Tourism Organization. The number of cruise passengers originating from Europe grew at a CAGR of 7.4% from the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2013, according to CLIA. The higher growth in the cruise market reflects the increasing proportion of cruises in the tourism market, especially in Europe. Based on cruise passenger data from CLIA and population data from the
116

United Nations, the proportion of the European population taking a cruise holiday more than doubled between the year ended December 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2013, from 0.4% to 0.9%. We believe the potential for future growth can be illustrated by comparison to the North American market, where the proportion of the population taking a cruise holiday is higher than in Europe and is continuing to grow. In North America, the proportion of the population taking a cruise holiday increased by approximately 30% from 1.9% to 2.5% between the year ended December 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2013, based on cruise passenger data from CLIA and population data from the United Nations.
The increased popularity of Norway as a cruise destination is evidenced by the increased number of foreign cruise passengers visiting Norway, which grew at a CAGR of 10.2% from the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2013, according to Cruise Norway. We believe that this growth has been stimulated by the increased awareness of the Norwegian coast as a place of natural beauty, and therefore as an attractive destination for nature-based tourism and exploration.
As a long-established Norwegian transport infrastructure provider, we have been able to leverage our operating model to offer a distinct expedition experience and a wide range of land-based excursions and activities. We have maintained the public service component of our offering, while developing our offering of exploration based voyages on our smaller ships that offer more direct access to nature and interaction with local culture.
We believe that the nature of our offering differentiates us from conventional cruise operators and attracts travelers seeking adventure nature-based vacations and local cultural experiences, which we believe is an attractive segment of the market.
In addition, over 70% of our guests in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, were 50 years of age or older. As a result, we are positioned to benefit from the demographic trend of aging populations, particularly in Western Europe, which is a key customer market for us in terms of our existing client base.
Differentiated competitive positioning and high barriers to entry
We believe that our product offering is distinct from the offering provided by large cruise operators and is designed to target a customer segment not fully served by other operators. Rather than offering cruises to classic tourist spots on a "floating hotel" style cruise liner, we aim to provide our guests with an opportunity to visit areas of natural beauty and to experience local culture through "expedition" style voyages to more remote, natural Polar regions. Our main Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast offerings attempt to appeal to guests who prefer to be "closer to nature" and who value "authentic" Norwegian experiences over the experiences provided by conventional cruises. Our smaller ships can be more easily maneuvered and therefore allow us to get closer to the coast and the sites of natural beauty that our guests seek, and our itinerary of 34 port calls throughout Norway provides guests with an opportunity to interact with local culture and enjoy a wide range of land-based excursions and activities, including in remote parts of northern Norway.
In addition to our Norwegian coastal voyage offerings, our MS Fram segment offers the opportunity to travel on our purpose-built ship and participate in expeditions in remote Polar waters around Svalbard (an archipelago on the border of the Arctic Ocean and the Norwegian Sea), Greenland and Antarctica year-round. Our hotel operations in Svalbard offer guests opportunities to go dog-sledding, cross-country skiing, kayaking, snowmobiling, sample local foods and observe the Svalbard flora and fauna (including polar bears, walruses, seals and arctic birds). We believe these offerings appeal to our more adventurous guests, who are seeking to try new, exciting activities and experiences.
Our Hurtigruten brand, which the New York Times called "one of Norway's treasured national symbols," has been cultivated over our 120-year history and draws upon our Norwegian heritage, enhancing our credentials with customers seeking authentic Norwegian cruise experiences. We believe that our brand has high recognition in our key markets, such as the Nordic countries and Germany. We believe that, based on our strong brand recognition and authentic, adventurous product offering, a large proportion of our guests would not view a cruise with a large cruise operator as an alternative to our voyages.
117

Our competitive position is supported by high barriers to entry in the exploration and nature-based tourism markets, especially for cruises. We have invested a significant amount in our fleet of 12 small cruise ships, which are specially designed to serve our distinctive product offering. Any new entrant into our market, seeking to provide expedition and nature-based tourism services, would need to make substantial investments in similar small ships before it could compete with our product offering. Based on the current terms of our Coastal Service Contract, we believe a full fleet of 11 ships would be required to provide the services stipulated by the contract, and few industry players would have such a fleet, or our long established history and brand recognition.

Resilient revenues, EBITDA and cash flow generation
Our Normalized total revenues and Normalized Adjusted EBITDA have increased over recent years, and we had Normalized total revenues of NOK 2,859.5 million, NOK 3,262.6 million and NOK 3,303.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. In addition, we had Normalized Adjusted EBITDA of NOK 210.0 million, NOK 524.6 million and NOK 565.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. In addition to benefiting from the underlying growth in the European and Norwegian cruise markets during this period, we believe that this resilience can be attributed to a number of factors, including the relative economic stability of the countries from which we draw most of our guests and the infrastructure-like qualities of the local transportation service provided under our Coastal Service Contract, under which we receive a fixed fee, regardless of passenger volumes, and which accounted for 20.8% of our Normalized total revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 and 11.4%, 19.0% and 23.0% of our Normalized total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

The following charts show the nationality of our guests per PCN and the age range of our guests per PCN in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014:

Nationality of our guests per PCN

Other, 9% Netherlands,

As illustrated above, the majority of our guests are 50 years of age or older and are based in a number of countries with generally strong economies, including Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States. As a result, we draw guests from a variety of countries and economies, and we are not reliant on any single economy to drive our business. In addition, the older demographic profile of our guests, who tend to be retired or semi-retired and have more stable spending power because of their fixed pensions and accumulated savings, means that our guests should tend to be less affected by periods of economic downturn.

We believe that our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment was more resilient during the recent economic

downturn compared to select large cruise operators with operations in Norway, based on publicly available

information of such competitors. During the period from 2007 to 2010, this segment only experienced a decline

in revenues excluding revenues from the Former Coastal Service Contract ("non-contractual revenues") in one

year. Specifically, non-contractual revenues generated by our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment increased

by 3.2% in 2008 compared to 2007, decreased by 8.0% in 2009 compared to 2008 and increased by 4.2% in 2010

compared to 2009. The decline in non-contractual revenues for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment in

2009

compared

to

2008

is

118

attributable to a number of factors, including a 5% decrease in PCNs for our coastal voyage guests and a 10% decrease in PCNs for our port-to-port guests.
Our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast operating profit before depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 was NOK 227.7 million (resulting in a margin of 9.1% of Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment revenues), NOK 247.6 million (resulting in a margin of 10.8% of Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment revenues) and NOK 258.6 million (resulting in a margin of 10.9% of Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment revenues), respectively. Operating profit before depreciation for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment increased in the year ended December 31, 2009, despite a decline in revenue in that year, demonstrating resilience in this segment. Among other things, this was due to a significant reduction in certain operating costs in 2009, including a 5.1% decrease in payroll costs and an 11.7% decrease in certain other operating costs, including bunker fuel costs, which decreased during the recent economic downturn.
Since December 2012, we have been implementing a number of administrative and operational cost saving initiatives in connection with our Efficiency Improvement Program. Many of the measures we have implemented as part of the Efficiency Improvement Program have sought to streamline our operations and central functions in order to enhance our operational efficiency and profitability and to position us to achieve our growth strategies in the future. As a result, our Normalized total revenues and Normalized Adjusted EBITDA have consistently increased each year since 2011.

Revenue visibility
We accept bookings for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast and MS Fram segments up to 27 months in advance, and our Spitsbergen hotels accept reservations up to 30 months in advance. We typically require our guests to pay a non-refundable deposit ranging from 10% to 30% of the total amount payable at the time the booking is made. Our advanced customer bookings provide us with visibility into near term revenue across our business segments. Moreover, the payment of the non-refundable deposit reduces the risk of cancellation. The balance is typically payable 30 to 60 days in advance of the commencement of our product offering. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, 34.7% and 76.4% of our reservations for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast products and MS Fram products, respectively, were made six months or more in advance of the month of the departure date. As of December 31, 2014, our pre-bookings for the next twelve months in terms of PCNs for the Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment were 9.2% higher than our pre-bookings for the next twelve months for the Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment were as of December 31, 2013.

The following charts show, for each of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast and MS Fram segments, prebookings in terms of value for the next twelve months as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014:

Well invested and fit for purpose asset base
We own 10 of the 12 ships we operate. The ships in our fleet were primarily built from the 1990s onwards and according to the Valuation Report prepared by V.Ships, our 10 owned ships have a combined estimated market value of approximately 292 million to 311 million and a total estimated replacement value of 750 million to 820 million as of August 2014. See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information--Ship Valuation Data." Our ships have between 10 and 35 years of working life
119

remaining, except for our smallest ship, MS Lofoten, which we expect to continue to operate for the duration of the Coastal Service Contract. Our fleet is suitable for Polar waters and our expedition-based activities and the number, size and range of capabilities of our purpose-built ships operating along the Norwegian coast are wellsuited to our business objectives and distinct offering, including delivering the services we provide under the Coastal Service Contract, thus strengthening our position as the incumbent operator under such government contract. Our ship, MS Fram, is purpose-built, specially designed and fitted for expedition voyages. Furthermore, based on our occupancy rate of 62.3% for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we have the potential to increase PCNs without incurring significant development capital expenditures. We also own the buildings and leasehold interests in the land with respect to our three hotels in Spitsbergen.

Qualified and experienced management team
Our CEO, Daniel Skjeldam, and his team successfully began a transformation of our business in 2012, which has since continued. Mr. Skjeldam was recently recognized for his efforts and was awarded Best leader in the travel industry in the Norwegian Grand Travel Awards 2015. Amongst other initiatives, members of our current management team have devised and implemented our Efficiency Improvement Program, which we introduced in December 2012. Since his appointment in October 2012, Mr. Skjeldam has continued to develop our management team with the appointment of, among others, Magnus Wrahme, our Senior Vice President Global Sales, in April 2013, who was subsequently appointed as our Chief Commercial Officer in April 2014 and Svein Taklo, our Chief Operational Officer and Senior Vice President of Maritime Operations, who was appointed in May 2014. In addition, during 2013, a number of new divisional managers were appointed to drive implementation of our new strategy and Efficiency Improvement Program. Our seven-person senior management team has a combined experience of 106 years in the tourism and maritime transportation sector industries and has a well-balanced mix of strategic leadership and organizational development expertise, industry experience and financial management skills. Our senior management team is supported by a strong team of operational managers. Drawing upon substantial operational and managerial expertise from within the cruise sector and other leisure sectors, our management team has realigned our strategy to focus on cost discipline and brand differentiation, positioning us for growth in the expedition market going forward.

Our Strategy
Our primary strategy is the profitable organic growth of our business, which we intend to achieve by focusing on the following strategic objectives:

Operational initiatives capturing substantial margin benefits
Our Normalized Adjusted EBITDA has increased by 27.6% from NOK 524.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to NOK 669.5 million in twelve months ended September 30, 2014. The ongoing implementation of our four-phase Efficiency Improvement Program since December 2012 has been a key driver underlying such increase. We have established a strong operational focus on cost control and have introduced a number of administrative and operational cost saving initiatives, which sought to streamline our operations and central functions in order to enhance our operational efficiency and profitability and to position us to be able to achieve our growth strategies in the future. For example, in order to reduce costs and drive margins in our key markets and regions, we have introduced a new cost-effective infrastructure by relocating our headquarters, centralizing various administrative functions, reorganizing our global sales and marketing offices and our Customer Reservation Call Center in Tallinn, divesting certain non-strategic assets and developing and upgrading our IT operating platforms. As a result of our Efficiency Improvement Program, our operational costs have declined substantially since 2012, and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we achieved total efficiency improvements of NOK 96.5 million in connection with the Efficiency Improvement Program.

In December 2013, we commenced the implementation of several new cost saving measures as part of phase

four of our Efficiency Improvement Program. These initiatives include improved procurement processes, as well

as measures designed to enhance our bunker fuel efficiency. The new procurement processes involve the

introduction

of

a

purchasing

framework

designed

to

align

120

procurement contract pricing with prevalent, competitive market pricing for various procurement inputs. The bunker fuel efficiency measures primarily consist of cleaning the exterior of each of our ships to remove debris annually, which will reduce drag, as well as operating our ships at a more fuel efficient speed. In addition to the cost saving measures discussed above, we have also implemented a number of revenue generating measures including offering a wider selection of dining options including an à la carte menu in our restaurants, increasing the number of points of sale and suggesting room upgrades to passengers at the time of booking. Phase four of our Efficiency Improvement Program is expected to be fully implemented by mid-2015. We expect that the preliminary results of these initiatives will be reflected in our operating results for 2015 and the full effect will be reflected in our operating results for 2016.
Expand our customer base to drive revenue growth
We carried approximately 84,765 coastal voyage guests (guests travelling more than five nights) in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. We seek to increase occupancy rates by using our flexible pricing model to attract guests year round. A high proportion of our operating costs, particularly those which relate to the operation of our ships, are fixed. As a result, we are positioned to leverage our fixed cost base to increase profitability by increasing our utilization rates without a corresponding increase in our cost base. By optimizing excess capacity on board our ships, we can maximize our net revenues without substantial new investments. In recent years we have developed various seasonal concepts to complement our peak season theme, including, "Autumn Gold" in the fall, "Hunting the Light" in the winter and "Arctic Awakening" in the spring. We use such seasonal concepts to attract customers seeking a distinct travel and expedition experience that is only available during specific times of the year. Such specialty marketing campaigns and seasonal itineraries seek to expand our existing offering and to increase demand during non-peak seasons without incurring additional costs.
We also seek to expand the number of our guests through our marketing activities and to increase awareness of our distinct explorer based brand proposition. We are taking steps to achieve this by:
· continuing to seek new guests in non-European geographies, where there is demand for exploration style activities, such as through our new sales and marketing office in Seattle, Washington, which services North America and which we opened in January 2014;
· improving our marketing materials to appeal to customers, through emphasizing our explorer based brand proposition, the vast range of activities we offer and the distinct geographies in which we operate; and
· strengthening our position as a key player in the Norwegian tourism market by working with local travel, trade and government agencies to develop Norwegian tourism and market the country internationally. We plan to continue working with local travel, trade and government agencies to increase the number of direct international flights to coastal destinations in Norway in order to encourage growth in the short-break market and to make our products along the Norwegian coast more easily accessible.
Enhance our product offering
One of the key goals of our Efficiency Improvement Program has been to drive operational efficiencies in order to rationalize our expense base and also to prepare for future growth. We seek to enhance and expand our product offering and increase our number of guests through the following key initiatives:
· continuing to use our explorer brand proposition and mindset, particularly with respect to our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast business segment, in order to position our offerings in the niche Norwegian explorer leisure service industry. By marketing all of our voyages as explorer services, we intend to further distinguish ourselves from traditional cruise and hotel operators. We plan to achieve this by increasing the range of exploration and nature-based activities we offer;
· continuing to use our longstanding Norwegian heritage and brand to align our offerings to reflect our Norwegian identity. For example, we intend to continue to serve local food and provide nature and history based lectures onboard our ships;
121

· adding new voyage and expedition itineraries to expand our product offering and encourage repeat business;
· extending our existing operations to offer an extended range of expedition activities in new areas on an opportunistic basis. For example, we plan to introduce an expedition voyage exploring the area around Spitsbergen from June to August 2015, which combines a sea voyage with our existing hotel operations in order to expand our product offering and to attract customers through these new offerings;
· further developing our land-based activities such as local food tours, bird watching, Lapland (Sami) cultural tours and visits to land-based sights, including glaciers, the North Cape and city tours, and experience and activity-based products in Spitsbergen by focusing on year-round activities and experiences; and
· securing incremental revenue through add-on services and improving products and services offered onboard our ships to increase onboard revenues.
Further expansion of our e-commerce channels
We aim to reach our customers through our various e-commerce channels, including our websites, mobile platforms, search engine marketing, social media accounts and email communications. We operate seven country-specific versions and one global version of our website, and we have become increasingly focused on digital sales and marketing in recent years. We use our website to update customers and potential customers on our latest product offerings and promotions, and we have significantly increased our traffic to our website through search engine optimization and search engine marketing.
Over the course of 2015, we intend to launch a program for digitizing and streamlining our commercial processes in order to increase sales as well as to reduce our sales and distribution costs. Our aim is to increase our overall online sales through self-service solutions, both for travel agents and guests that book directly with us. The first stage of this e-commerce upgrade is expected to become operational during the second half of 2015 and will include a new website designed to increase interaction with users as well as more inspirational content to attract guests, and more effective booking functions. The second stage will introduce other improvements, including personal user profiles for every guest linked with our customer relation management system, which will enable us to directly provide our customers with targeted marketing materials, and enhanced functionality for offering various supplemental packages and additional services before, during and after a voyage. We intend to introduce mobile and tablet applications as part of our digital offering and a function allowing our port-to-port guests to book more quickly.
History and Development
The coastline between Bergen and Kirkenes is over 2,400 kilometers long, and prior to the 1890's the communication between the south and north of Norway was limited, both on land and at sea. Maritime maps were unreliable, and there were only a few lighthouses established, especially in the north. It was essential for the Norwegian government to establish a safe trade and passenger route to link the southern and northern regions of Norway.
Established by Richard With, what is now known as Hurtigruten commenced its operations in 1893 by transporting mail, cargo, local passengers and international tourists along the Norwegian coast. To this day, our ships continue to carry cargo, but the proportion of passengers has steadily increased. We believe that for many locals, as well as being a means of transport, the ships are part of Norwegian tradition and culture. Historically, we established our operations based on public services through the transportation of cargo and provision of public transport. We have continued to provide such public services under our Coastal Service Contract and have used our geographic operations, ships and operating model to create what we believe is a distinct coastal voyage offering, by offering explorer and nature-based voyages to a largely international customer base. We continue to be a transport infrastructure provider, and we have expanded our operations to offer vacation and tourist services through our coastal voyage offering as part of our increasing focus on growing and developing our tourist based business.
122

A few years after commencing the Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast service in 1893, Richard With established an additional route from the North Cape to Spitsbergen, with the steam ship DS Lofoten. In 1896, he built Spitsbergen's first hotel in the Advent Fjord, thus taking the first steps towards introducing tourism to the mining and hunting population of Spitsbergen. We now provide these tourism services through our Spitsbergen Travel segment, established in 1988.
In 2002, we entered the expedition segment by offering trips to Antarctica. In 2007, our new purpose-built expedition ship, MS Fram, was completed and embarked on its maiden voyage to Greenland.
In 2006, two shipping companies operating under the Hurtigruten brand, Ofotens og Vesterålens Dampskipsselskab and Troms Fylkes Dampskipsselskab, merged to become Hurtigruten ASA.
In 2008 and 2009, we implemented some initial measures aimed at reducing our operating costs. We integrated our sales office and commenced the process of corporate reorganization. We also divested most of our ferry and fast ferry operations, including a fleet of 45 smaller fast ferries in order to re-focus on our core business of exploration travel and coastal voyages.
In 2009, our shareholder Periscopus initially invested in Hurtigruten. This was followed by an investment by our shareholder Home Capital in 2011.
In 2012 and 2013, our new CEO, Daniel Skjeldam and his team implemented new cost efficiency measures through the introduction of our Efficiency Improvement Program. The program involved the continued disposition of non-core assets, including our Fast Ferries Business and Bus Business.
In December 2014, Hurtigruten and its subsidiaries were acquired by our current shareholders as part of the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions. Following the issuance of the Notes, Hurtigruten will be delisted from the Oslo Stock Exchange and will cease to be a publicly traded company. See "Summary--Recent Developments-- The Hurtigruten Acquisition and the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions."
Efficiency Improvement Program In December 2012, we initiated our four phase Efficiency Improvement Program at both the Group level
and at our global sales and marketing offices. Our Efficiency Improvement Program is aimed at optimizing our organizational structure, on land and at sea, reducing operational and administrative costs, refining and standardizing our hotel and maritime operations, increasing onboard revenues and revitalizing our voyage offerings by improving the customer experience in order to attract more guests and to further differentiate our offering from our competitors' offerings. The changes we have implemented relate to our overall organizational structure, with the main focus on our global sales organization, our 12-strong fleet of ships and capturing synergies through consolidation of our corporate headquarters.
We completed the implementation of phases one, two and three of our Efficiency Improvement Program by July 2014. We have commenced the implementation of phase four of our Efficiency Improvement Program and expect to complete that phase by mid-2015.
Phase one of our Efficiency Improvement Program commenced in December 2012 and was completed by July 2014.
The key initiatives under phase one included: · A new cost-effective organizational structure, including:
· Establishing our new corporate center in Tromsø: In order to consolidate our corporate headquarters and centralize administrative functions, we closed our former head office in Narvik, which involved the termination or relocation of a total of 65 administrative employees. We sold our office in Narvik in March 2013 and closed our leased office in Tromsø in December 2013, which was sold by its owner, ANS Havnebygningen, in which we had a 50% ownership interest. We also entered into a new lease for our new corporate headquarters in Tromsø in September 2013.
123

· Centralization and downsizing of our land-based central functions and organization: As part of our goal to centralize administrative functions and introduce more streamlined processes, we reduced headcount and integrated certain administrative roles and functions between December 2012 and April 2013.
· Divestment of non-strategic assets: We sold several non-strategic assets in 2013 and 2014. In addition to the sale of our former corporate offices in Narvik and Tromsø, we also sold a residential property we owned in Narvik in May 2013, our Fast Ferries Business in March 2014 and our Bus Business, in which we had a 71.3% ownership interest, in July 2014.
· Optimizing the commercial hotel and maritime operations: We have optimized our hotel and maritime operations with a focus on increased onboard revenues, and by offering a more personal and professional standard of service. For example, we offer local food in our restaurants together with storytelling, in order to provide an authentic Norwegian experience.
· Crew center established with a focus on development and crew planning: In August 2013, we established a crew center in Kirkenes and transferred all of our 1,600 crew employees to this center. Furthermore, we introduced measures to standardize procedures, protocols and service levels on all of our ships. We introduced initiatives aimed at improving our crew planning and staffing efficiency and also implemented crew rotation programs to ensure breadth of experience to enable our crew to develop professionally.
Phase two of our Efficiency Improvement Program commenced in May 2013 and was completed in November 2013. The key initiatives under phase two included:
· Optimizing our global sales and marketing offices and marketing functions and aligning our call center organization with our new corporate structure, including:
· A reorganized global sales organization, with Nordic sales conducted through our new sales and marketing office in Oslo: In mid-2013, we opened a new sales and marketing office in Oslo in order to centralize sales staff that were previously based in local branch offices. As a result, we sought to achieve more efficient operations through a results-driven organization, with a focus both on our local transport services and our commercial services.
· Reallocation of resources in line with our new corporate structure: We also reallocated certain resources between our corporate headquarters and global sales and our marketing offices to streamline certain functions by further centralizing land-based roles. For example, in connection with the elimination of certain local marketing roles, we reallocated certain people in these functions to new roles.
Phase three of our Efficiency Improvement Program commenced in mid-2013 and was completed by the end of 2013. The key initiatives under phase three included:
· Centralization and rebuilding our IT platforms and our central reservation infrastructure: We rebuilt and centralized our IT infrastructure systems and Customer Reservation Call Centers, including:
· Reorganization of our Customer Reservation Call Center in Tallinn: In the fall of 2013, we reorganized our Customer Reservation Call Center in order to reduce the number of staff and to better align our central reservation infrastructure with our new organization. We downsized our Customer Reservation Call Center in Tallinn by approximately 25% and focused on integrating our central reservation systems with our sales organization in order to increase the familiarity of our sales staff with our product offering, streamline processes and to optimize our revenues.
· Reorganization our IT operating platforms: Historically, we had multiple IT platforms for our administrative, accounting and finance and other operational functions. We introduced new software programs to maximize the functionality of these systems and reduce the number of operating systems.
· Taking control of (in-sourcing) key functions: We previously outsourced the majority of our IT functions. As part of phase three, we gradually in-sourced the day-to-day operations of our IT systems, thereby reducing our reliance on third parties. Such functions include management of our internal help desk and e-commerce platform. Our in-house IT team also took over primary responsibility for developing software for our needs and our strategic objectives, including developing our new e-commerce platforms.
· Upsizing number of IT personnel: In connection with in-sourcing key IT functions and our central reservation infrastructure, we increased the number of employees in our IT department, allowing us to decrease our use of external consultants at the same time.
124

Phase four of our Efficiency Improvement Program was launched in December 2013, and is expected to be fully implemented by mid-2015. The key initiatives under phase four include:
· Measures related to ship operation, including:
· Reductions in bunker oil consumption: We have introduced measures intended to increase bunker fuel efficiency, mainly through annual hull cleaning. Furthermore, we are currently renegotiating the terms of our agreements with third-party excursion providers to incentivize them to return guests to our ships on time, thereby reducing delays and the need to increase the speed of travel, which consumes extra bunker fuel.
· Training of crew: We have focused on the development of our crew by implementing performance measures, sales training and increased rotation of crew between ships to enhance experience and career progression prospects for our crew.
· Increased effects from purchasing: We have also introduced measures to standardize our procurement processes by implementing stricter purchase policies, including reducing the number of suppliers from whom we purchase goods and services. We have also negotiated more competitive terms with respect to the procurement of certain goods and services, including insurance and food and beverage.
· Increased onboard sales: We have introduced a number of revenue generating measures including offering a wider selection of dining options including an à la carte menu in our restaurants, increasing the number of points of sales and suggesting room upgrades to passengers at the time of booking.
As a result of our Efficiency Improvement Program, our operational costs have declined substantially since 2012, and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we achieved total efficiency improvements of NOK 96.5 million in connection with the Efficiency Improvement Program. We believe that our Efficiency Improvement Program has positioned us for the implementation of our strategic initiatives and the next phase of development of our operations.
Our Segments
Our business is currently divided into three product segments: Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast, MS Fram and Spitsbergen Travel.
Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast
Our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment is a cruise voyage, local passenger ferry and cargo transportation business that operates between Bergen and Kirkenes along the Norwegian coast. The Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment is our largest segment and accounted for 84.9% of our revenues from continuing operations in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.
Our route between Bergen and Kirkenes is operated by 11 ships, which make 34 northbound and 33 southbound daily departures from ports year-round. Ships leave Bergen (northbound) and Kirkenes (southbound) every day to cover the distance to Kirkenes (northbound) or Bergen (southbound) and back at an average speed of 15 knots, and a round trip is typically completed by each vessel every 12 days. We sold 1,075,251 PCNs within our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.
We are the exclusive coastal sea transport provider covering the full distance between Bergen and Kirkenes. We face limited transport competition from a domestic airline, as well as local bus and ferry services and the Norwegian State Railways. However, the trains operated by the Norwegian State Railways do not travel beyond Bodø and therefore cannot provide local transport and cargo transportation in the region north of Bodø.
In the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, the 11 ships in our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment had an occupancy rate of 62.3%.
We service two main guest groups along the Norwegian coast: coastal voyage guests and port-to-port guests. We offer a distinct and flexible operating model, which allows our guest to choose their itinerary, length of stay and type of transportation facilities.
125

The following map indicates our route along the Norwegian coast:
Coastal Voyage Guests Coastal voyage guests are holiday travelers that book a coastal voyage service for five or more nights, which includes accommodation on board the ship, meals, a wide range of exciting shore excursions and a number of stops in up to 34 ports of call northbound and in up to 33 ports of call southbound along the coast from Bergen to Kirkenes. We offer coastal voyages ranging from 5 to 11 nights. Our onboard facilities and activities include various dining options, panorama lounges, fully licensed bars and cafeterias where our guests can purchase hot and cold drinks and snacks, concession shops offering various gift items, including expedition clothing and souvenirs, as well as libraries. We also offer lectures by our expedition team. Meals on our ships are served at the restaurant where our chefs prepare either a three-course dinner or a buffet. In addition, many of our voyages provide our guests with the opportunity to try local specialties, such as reindeer meat and cloudberries, fresh fish, king crabs and local shrimp. Unlike most of our competitors, our onboard entertainment does not include commercial entertainment, such as casinos. Instead we focus on the distinct natural and cultural environment through which we travel and offer our guests lectures on the history, culture and biology relevant to the specific region. In addition, we also offer musical entertainment in the bar area on some stretches of certain voyages during peak seasons. Our onboard offerings cater to both our coastal voyage guests and our port-to-port guests, which allows us to offer flexible packages to both groups. For example, we operate a cafeteria primarily for our port-to-port ships guests but it is also open to our coastal voyage guests. Guests can also buy various supplemental packages either in advance or onboard the ship, such as wine packages.
126

When docking in one of the many ports in which we call during the cruise, we offer our guests the opportunity to participate in hikes and visits to local cultural or natural attractions arranged and led by our own expedition leaders. Tickets to these activities can be purchased either before boarding our ships or while onboard through our expedition leader. In addition, we work with many local excursion organizers along the Norwegian coast to offer more than 50 distinct shore excursions for our coastal voyage guests in order to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and to enhance the overall customer experience we offer. For example, we can arrange for our guests to participate in activities such as driving snowmobiles in Kjøllefjord, dog sledding in midTroms and Kirkenes, mountain hikes in Lofoten, Tromsø and Hammerfest and visiting a fish farm in Brønnøysund. Continuing to develop our distinctive character is important in order to differentiate our products from those offered by competitors. An experience based on natural wonders, close contact with Norway's coastal culture and ordinary life, and distinct travel experiences are the key elements we focus on. Both our employees on our ships and in support functions ashore are familiar with the Norwegian coast and what it can offer our guests.
We sold 713,319 PCNs, representing 66.3% of our total PCNs within our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 to coastal voyage guests.

Port-to-Port Guests
Port-to-port guests are guests travelling less than five nights on our ships and are mostly composed of Norwegian leisure travelers and some international leisure travelers. The provision of our services to local guests is governed under our Coastal Service Contract. See "--Coastal Service Contract."
Our port-to-port service is used as a means of transport over a shorter distance, often as an alternative form of local transport, for weekend outings with friends and family or for short-break vacations. As a result of our flexible operating model, which allows guests to choose their itinerary and length of stay, we attract both international and local guests.
Our port-to-port guests can enjoy the same services and facilities on board our ships. Guests traveling shorter distances tend to purchase a ticket for travel and to pay for other services as they go. In addition, such guests often purchase a ticket for the transportation of their vehicle. Our port-to-port guests also have the option to purchase services and packages similar to those we offer our coastal voyage guests in advance.
We sold 361,932 PCNs, representing 33.7% of our total PCNs within our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 to port-to-port guests.

Transportation of Cargo
In addition to passengers, we also transport a wide variety of cargo on the route between Bergen and Kirkenes, ranging from cars and fish to mail. The provision of our cargo transportation services to local guests is governed by our Coastal Service Contract. See "--Coastal Service Contract."
We carry cargo over long distances, and we believe we are often the only cargo carrier serving the coastal population in many of the remote areas we service for regular transport of fresh produce and products. We transported approximately 96,760 tons of goods, 95,942 tons of goods, and 97,773 tons of goods, in the year ended December 31, 2012, the year ended December 31, 2013 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, respectively. Almost half the cargo we carry is transported to Finnmark, and we have extended the time we spend in Havøysund in order to deliver fish which must reach the markets as quickly as possible.

Coastal Service Contract

Our operation of the coastal passenger and cargo transportation service between Bergen and Kirkenes is

governed by our current coastal service contract with the Norwegian government represented by the Ministry of

Transport and which was entered into in April 2011 and expires on December 31, 2019 (the "Coastal Service

Contract"), and which may be extended for an additional year at the option of the Ministry of Transport. Pursuant

to

our

Coastal

Service

Contract,

we

are

127

required to ensure 34 northbound and 33 southbound daily departures from ports throughout the year. We are required to provide local passenger transport on the entire route between Bergen and Kirkenes. In addition, we are required to offer cargo transport on the Tromsø-Kirkenes round-trip route. Under the Coastal Service Contract, our ships are required to have minimum capacity for 320 guests, berth capacity for 120 guests and cargo capacity of 150 euro pallets (in the cargo hold at standard cargo height). Our ships must also have passenger facilities, including food service.

Our fee under the Coastal Service Contract is based on an annual payment plan in an aggregate amount of NOK 5.1 billion over the term of the agreement. Both the duration of and the fee pursuant to the Coastal Service Contract are conditional upon the Norwegian parliament making the necessary funds available in the annual state budget. The agreed fee is subject to adjustment for increases in certain of our operating costs due to inflation as measured by Statistics Norway's cost index for coastal and interior travel sub-index for ferry operations. The price adjustments for each year are based on changes during the last twelve months measured as of February 15 of the prior year, which means that our recovery of increased costs could be delayed by almost two years. If the cited cost index is unavailable, Statistics Norway's consumer price index is used. In addition, under certain circumstances, the terms of the Coastal Service Contract may be subject to renegotiation. For example, in the event of unforeseeable changes in legislation that result in significant additional costs or savings under the Coastal Service Contract, either party may require extraordinary adjustments to be made to the terms of the Contract. Under the Coastal Service Contract a significant change includes any change that would result in an increase or decrease of more than 5% of the agreed annual remuneration for the current year. The fee under the Coastal Service Contract is payable by the Ministry of Transport in monthly installments on the first day of each month. If we do not fulfill the agreed service requirements the fee is also subject to downward adjustments. If for example, one of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships was to fall out of service for an extended period of time and we as a consequence were unable to ensure 34 northbound and 33 southbound daily departures from the required ports, the fee could be reduced by 1/6 of the daily fee attributable to that vessel for each cancelled port. In addition, we are obliged to pay liquidated damages equivalent to the fee per ship for the time out of service, unless the relevant off-hire period is due to documentable technical conditions or unforeseen repairs or maintenance. We are however entitled to cancel port departures without fee reduction or liability under the Coastal Service Contract for a period of up to 10 operating days per ship per year due to planned maintenance and unforeseen operational disturbances and two operating days per ship per year for use for cultural events. In addition, in instances of force majeure events (including adverse weather) we are entitled to suspend our performance without liability. However, we are not entitled to any fee for the period during which one of our ships is off-hire due to a force majeure event other than in the case of extraordinary weather conditions. The Ministry of Transport is entitled to demand liquidated damages for any breach of the contract which has not been remedied and may cancel the contract in the event of a material default, including repeated failures to meet obligations or repeated unfulfilled requests for remediation.

In connection with entering into the Coastal Service Contract, we have been issued a license from the Ministry of Transport to operate the entire route along the Norwegian coast between Bergen and Kirkenes. This license is valid for the same term as the Coastal Service Contract.

It is a requirement under the Coastal Service Contract that we provide an on-demand guarantee in an amount equal to at least 15% of the annual fee under the contract, at all times. In order to comply with such requirements, we have procured two guarantees in the aggregate amount of NOK 130 million from the insurance companies Tryg Garanti and Atradius (each of which has provided a guarantee for a sum of up to NOK 65 million). Such guarantees expire June 30, 2021 but may be terminated by the Tryg Garanti and Atradius, as applicable, at any time, subject to six months' prior written notice.

We are currently involved in discussions with the Ministry of Transport regarding the interpretation of

certain terms of the Coastal Service Contract, including our obligations to offer minimum berth capacity.

According to the Coastal Service Contract, our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships must have a minimum berth

capacity for 120 guests. We are currently involved in discussions as to whether it is sufficient to have a minimum

berth capacity for 120 guests on our ships or if these 120 berths are required to be reserved for certain categories

of short distance guests. We have only experienced shortages of berths with respect to our short distance guests a

few times a year, typically during our peak season, when all berths on board our ships are sold out and as a

consequence,

we

cannot

offer

a

128

berth to all our short distance guests. We have proposed a "space guarantee" solution to the Ministry of Transport, which under certain conditions would entitle short distance guests, who we cannot offer a berth, the choice between travelling on the originally scheduled voyage free of charge with the promise that if a berth becomes available during such voyage, it will be offered free of charge, or travelling on the next voyage free of charge, including a free of charge berth. We have implemented this proposal but it has not yet been formally approved by the Ministry of Transport. See also "Risk Factors--Risks Relating to Our Business and Operations--The Coastal Service Contract requires us to provide certain services and, accordingly, restricts our ability to offer other services that may be more profitable."
In the event of unforeseeable changes in legislation, regulations or governmentally imposed supplements, which impose additional significant costs or savings under the Coastal Service Contract, either party may require extraordinary remuneration adjustments, production changes or any other suitable measures.
Upon the expiration of the Coastal Service Contract, we expect any new coastal service contract to be subject to a public tender offer process. There may be competitive bids and we may not be awarded the new contract or license to operate the route along the Norwegian coast on commercially favorable terms, or at all. See also "Risk Factors--Risks Relating to Our Business and Operations--A significant portion of our revenue comes from passenger and cargo transportation services governed by the Coastal Services Contract, which expires in 2019."
MS Fram
Our MS Fram segment comprises the MS Fram explorer ship, which takes our guests on Polar expeditions year-round in Antarctic, Spitsbergen and Greenland waters. The MS Fram commenced its operations in 2007, is our newest ship, was purpose-built for this type of operation in cold weather conditions and can be adapted for use in our Norwegian coastal operations. It has a total of 276 berths and is designed for an optimum balance between comfort and Polar experience, with large panorama windows to allow our guests to observe their surroundings. The cabins on MS Fram tend to be more spacious and comfortable compared to many of the cabins operated under our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment.
We sold 67,521 PCNs onboard MS Fram in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. MS Fram is our second largest segment and accounted for 9.7% of our revenues from continuing operations in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.
We offer expedition itineraries ranging from nine days to three weeks, calling on multiple ports in four major Polar destinations, including Antarctica, Greenland, Iceland and Spitsbergen, and from April 2015, we will add Norway as a destination. MS Fram sails in the Antarctic waters of the southern hemisphere November through March and during this time, our customers primarily comprise German and United States guests. During the summer and fall months, MS Fram heads north to the Arctic seas around Greenland and Spitsbergen, where we have a more global customer mix. We change our itineraries every year to allow for variation and to appeal to our guests, including repeat customers. For the 2015 season, we have introduced a "Deeper into the Fjord" itinerary.
The package we offer for our MS Fram service is more inclusive compared to our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment and includes board and meals. We also offer optional extras, including flights and supplemental packages, such as wine packages. In addition to standard onboard facilities and activities, such as a restaurant, a panorama lounge, a fully licensed bar and observation and sun decks, MS Fram is equipped with a fitness room, on-deck open air jacuzzis and facilities where our expedition team host lectures. Meals on MS Fram are served at the restaurant or in the bistro where our chefs prepare either a three course dinner or a buffet. Unlike most of our competitors, our onboard entertainment does not include commercial entertainment, such as casinos. Instead, we focus on the distinct natural and cultural environment through which we journey and offer our guests lectures on the history, culture and biology relevant for the specific area visited. In addition, we also offer musical entertainment in the bar area on some stretches of certain voyages during peak seasons.
We offer our guests the opportunity to participate in hikes, small boat expeditions, kayaking and other maritime and land-based activities, as well as visits to local cultural or natural attractions arranged and lead by our expedition leaders. We also offer distinct expedition style adventures
129

including an overnight camping experience on Antarctic glaciers. MS Fram has been specially designed for Polar expeditions and we have a number of Polar circle landing boats, which offer a safer and more comfortable means of transporting guests from MS Fram to glaciers and other landings. Tickets to these activities can be purchased either before boarding our ships or while onboard.
Explorer cruises in Polar waters have become an important strategic focus for us.

Spitsbergen Travel
Our Spitsbergen Travel segment was established in 1988 and relates to our operations in Spitsbergen, including the operation of three hotels, as well as an equipment store and a host of tourist activities. Our Spitsbergen Travel segment accounted for 5.5% of our revenues from continuing operations in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014.

We operate three hotels in Longyearbyen, including onsite restaurants and retail stores. We have a license to operate one of these hotels under the Radisson Blu brand and another hotel under the Rica brand, which will become a Scandic brand company from February 2015. We operate the third hotel under our own brand, Spitsbergen Guest House, which we intend to rebrand as Coal Miners Cabins ("CMC") from March 2015. The Radison Blu hotel is open year-round, while the Rica hotel and the CMC are closed from four to six months during the winter season in Spitsbergen.

We operate the Radisson Blu hotel under a license agreement with Radisson Blu, under which we pay a monthly license fee based on revenues in exchange for the use of the Radisson Blu brand name. Our guests may use Radisson Blu's e-commerce channel and booking systems to make reservations at this hotel. Radisson Blu is obligated to list our Spitsbergen hotel in their directories and publications. The license agreement expires on December 31, 2021 and may not be terminated in the absence of a default. We hold the leasehold interest in the Radisson Blu hotel.

We operate the Rica hotel under a partner agreement with Rica, which allows us to use the Rica brand name and participate in marketing and promotional activities arranged by Rica. No fee is payable for the use of the Rica brand name, but, we pay for certain services, including booking fees for any bookings made through Rica's system. Such booking fees are based on commissions and transaction fees. The agreement may be terminated by either party with twelve months' notice. We hold the leasehold interest in the Rica hotel.

We also operate Spitsbergen Guest House and we intend to rebrand this under our own CMC brand in March 2015. CMC consists of four properties. We ground lease three of these four properties, each of which has 25 double hotel rooms. We lease the building on the fourth property, which houses our reception, bar and dining area, under a long-term lease agreement, which expires in 2022. See "--Property and Equipment."

We also ground lease a property called Camp Barentz, which we use as a destination for our guests to visit. The camp comprises a collection of camp buildings, including facilities for entertaining and dining in natural surroundings. The camp offers an opportunity for our guests to experience Spitsbergen's wilderness and features a dog yard with huskies, Barentz House and a large "gamme," a traditional northern Norwegian style of building, which can seat up to 70 guests. Barentz House accommodates up to 40 guests and offers traditional dining options and a wide range of lectures on Polar heritage.

We are responsible for all our Spitsbergen hotel operations, including the hiring and managing of personnel and the maintaining and repairing each of the properties. We employ all hotel employees through one corporate entity in order to maximize the use of our employees by staffing our personnel to work various shifts in each of our three hotels. We also typically employ additional staff on a seasonal basis between March and September to cover our peak season.

We offer a variety of tourist activities in Spitsbergen through our hotels and also through our equipment

store, Ingeniør G. Paulsen. We also offer a wide range of arctic experiences on snow-covered and snow-free

terrain, including short day trips on skis, dog sledding, snowmobile hire, boat or hiking excursions, and longer

expeditions in the archipelago. In addition, Ingeniør G. Paulsen sells leisure clothing and offers equipment hire,

including

snowmobiles

and

boats.

Ingeniør

G.

Paulsen

130

operates as an agent for different weapons manufacturers and several major snow equipment and snow transportation brands, such as Yamaha, Polaris Snowmobiles and Polar Circle Boats. These products are mainly sold to local residents and businesses, expedition members and local government entities.
We intend to offer an expedition voyage exploring the area around Spitsbergen from June to August 2015. We have entered into a charter agreement dated August 22, 2014 to charter MS Nordstjernen, a ship we previously owned, on a short-term basis to operate this service, and we have the option to extend this charter agreement for up to four additional terms for 2016 through 2019. By offering this service during summer months, we hope to expand the range of activities offered by our Spitsbergen Travel segment.

Our Fleet
Our fleet comprises of 12 purpose-built ships that sail along the Norwegian coast or in Polar waters. We seek to differentiate our offering through authentic Norwegian dining options based on local food, lounges with large panorama windows, observation decks and a wide range of comfortable cabins and suites with private balconies on some of our ships.

The table below provides a brief description of our ships and areas of operation based on itineraries as of September 30, 2014:

We are the registered owner of 10 of the 12 ships in our fleet. We lease MS Richard With and MS Nordlys under 15-year bareboat leases with Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, respectively, to whom we sold these ships in December 2002 and June 2003, respectively. The lease agreements expire in February 2018 for MS Richard With and August 2018 for MS Nordlys, in each case, with options to extend for up to an additional five years on market terms. Any redesign or physical changes to our two leased ships, except for changes to fulfil statutory requirements, are required to be approved by the owners before work commences. If the owners do not accept our proposed changes, we have a right to effect such changes, provided that we restore the ships to their former condition before redelivery upon the expiry of the lease. We are not liable for ordinary wear and tear. We are required to maintain these leased ships in operation as passenger ships in compliance with relevant regulation, including maintenance of all certificates and performing any upgrades required to obtain such certificates.

Each bareboat lease agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum amount of liquidity at all times, and non-compliance with the covenant is a default under the contract and could result in the relevant agreement being terminated. Accordingly, any failure to meet our minimum liquidity obligations under the leases could adversely affect our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast segment's ability to carry out its cruise operations or fulfill its obligations under the Coastal Service Contract, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
131

Ship Operations Maintenance
Pursuant to the requirements based on SOLAS and to some extent the International Load Lines Convention, we are required to dry-dock our ships twice every five years and the maximum duration between each dry-dock cannot exceed three years. We do not earn revenue while ships are dry-docked. Accordingly, we typically schedule such dry-dock work during non-peak seasons in our first and fourth calendar quarters in order to minimize the impact on our revenues. For MS Fram, such dry-dockings are scheduled between our Northern hemisphere and Southern hemisphere seasonal services.
Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships are generally taken out of service approximately every second or third year, for a period typically ranging between 11 and 22 days for scheduled maintenance work, repairs and improvements. Due to the age of the ship, MS Lofoten is required to undergo dry-docking every year, typically for the same period as our other Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships. On average, we dry-dock four to five ships each year.
MS Fram is required to dry-dock twice every five years and is typically out of service for a period of seven to 14 days each time. Capacity for MS Fram will be reduced in 2015 as a result of planned maintenance and changes to the sailing plan. Because MS Fram is the only ship servicing our MS Fram segment, the financial performance of the segment is weaker during years when we take the ship out of service for planned dry-docking.
In addition to the required dry-docking of our ships, we conduct ongoing, routine repairs and maintenance as necessary. Such ongoing maintenance is performed both while our ships are in operation, to the extent possible, and when our ships are in dry-dock. Certain maintenance work, such as maintenance on the propulsion systems, automations systems, main electrical systems and steam systems, as well as all underwater equipment on the ship's hull, is required to be completed during dry-docking due to limitations on the accessibility of equipment and certain parts of the ship that can only be accessed during dry-docking. In addition, we typically undertake maintenance work that may inconvenience our guests while our ships are in dry-dock.
Suppliers and Service Providers Our largest suppliers supply us with bunker fuel, food and beverage, shipyard and maintenance services,
port services, IT services, travel agent services, office services and advertising and marketing. Certain of our suppliers also provide us with office space and call center staffing, especially in our Seattle office. Most of the supplies and services that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices. In addition, owing to the large quantities that we purchase, we can negotiate favorable terms and prices for many of our supplies. Our purchases are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, Norwegian kroner and euros. Payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry.
Our ships are serviced by certain key service providers and require specific parts and technical capabilities. There is a limited number of shipyards and maintenance service providers that can provide the services we require to maintain our ships, especially given the fact that we typically seek to dry-dock our ships in proximity to their routes.
In addition, we depend on local port owners and operators in order to operate our services. Under the Coastal Service Contract, we are required to stop in the 34 ports along the coast from Bergen to Kirkenes. We are required to pay a fee for use of the port, as well as terminal services offered by larger ports such as Bergen. Such fees are typically based on the size of the ship and we may be subject to additional fees that are calculated based on the number of guests we carry. See "Risk Factors--Lack of continuing availability of attractive, convenient and safe port destinations on terms that are favorable or consistent with our expectations could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects."

Revenue Management Practices Coastal Voyage Guests and MS Fram Guests
Our base package includes accommodation and full board on the coastal voyage selected. Prices vary depending on the particular coastal voyage itinerary, cabin category selected, the time of year that the coastal voyage takes place and the utilization rate of the ship at the point of booking. We also offer a range of supplemental packages that may be purchased in advance or on board our ships. Depending on the product and the location, excursions, flights, hotels and transfers are sold as extras or part of a package. For example, our packages often include transport to remote areas where our ships depart. In addition, guests traveling on our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships can also transport their own vehicles on board our ships for an extra charge. The prices for our MS Fram products are higher compared to our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast products due to the remote and exotic voyages offered and higher demand for adventure-style expedition trips.
We operate a flexible pricing model, which seeks to maximize bookings at optimal prices and allows our guests to choose among various itinerary options. We monitor our booking developments and adjust our price matrix accordingly, depending on rates of utilization, season and time to departure. We encourage travelers to book early, and we look to build significant volume well before our sail dates so we can manage our occupancy rate. We perform extensive analyses of our databases in order to determine booking history and trends, cabin category, travel partner, market segment, and itinerary and distribution channel. In addition, we establish a set of cabin categories throughout each ship and price our fares on the basis of these cabin categories. In 2014, using our flexible pricing model, we sought to maximize occupancy by introducing additional promotions for shorter voyage bookings made within 30 days of the departure date and we have experienced an increase in last minute bookings as a result.
Typically, the initial published fares are established at least 15 months in advance of the commencement of a season. For example, our initial published fares for the season commencing in January 2016 were set in October 2014. If the booking trend at which cabin inventory is sold differs from expectations, we retain the flexibility to update our offers accordingly. These adjustments are implemented through various marketing activities including promotions, special rate codes, opening and closing cabin categories, or price changes.
We measure our available cabin inventory against predetermined milestones in order to determine when to increase our price matrix to the next level in our flexible pricing model. By regularly monitoring our bookings, we are positioned to optimize our booking curve and shorten the time required to implement pricing decisions.
Port-to-Port Guests Port-to-port tickets are either sold as deck space (travel ticket only), or with a cabin including breakfast. Our
port-to-port guests can also transport their own vehicles on board our ships for an extra charge. The maximum fares that we may charge for deck space tickets are regulated under the Coastal Service Contract and tend to increase each year. Under the Coastal Service Contract, we collect and retain revenues from deck space ticket sales and also receive a monthly fee from the Ministry of Transport. We are also required to offer public discounts such as military, senior and child discounts, which are based on the deck space price only. See "-- Coastal Service Contract."
Deck space tickets are sold based on a fixed price model, while itineraries with cabins are based on a flexible price model, which is adjusted depending on cabin category, rates of utilization, season and time to departure. Such adjustments are implemented through various marketing activities including promotions.
We also offer a range of add-on products that may be purchased in advance or on board our ships. Excursions, flights, hotels and transfers are sold as extras.
Cargo Under our Coastal Service Contract, we are required to maintain minimum cargo capacity on each of our
Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships; and we have entered into a space charter agreement
133

with Nor Lines regarding utilization of our cargo holds. Under our agreement with Nor Lines, they have purchased and agreed to operate the cargo space in each of our 11 Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships. Nor Lines was previously a subsidiary of the Group and was sold in December 2010. Nor Lines continues to operate our cargo holds under the terms of the original agreement. Nor Lines contracts directly with its cargo customers to pack and transport cargo including cars, fish, mail and other cargo. However, we are responsible for transporting cargo and are liable for any damage which is sustained from the time such cargo is loaded on our ships to the time such cargo is unloaded. Nor Lines will, according to the agreement, indemnify us for any third-party claims related to damage that occurs before or after loading or unloading cargo. However, should the time of the damage be impossible to prove, Nor Lines may hold us accountable for damages that are discovered before delivery, or in relation to delivery to Nor Lines customers.
Under this agreement, Nor Lines is required to pay a fixed annual fee to us, which is subject to adjustments based on our operating schedule. Our fees depend on the number of service days of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships. Dry-docks and the number of days each ship is out of service impacts this number. In addition, we are entitled to an additional bonus fee under certain circumstances where Nor Lines revenues from the agreement exceed certain thresholds. To the extent that we reduce the cargo-carrying capacity on our ships as a result of modifications to comply with the 305 Classification, Nor Lines may seek to amend the terms of the space charter agreement to reduce our charter hire fees in line with such reductions in capacity. Our space charter agreement with Nor Lines specifies the amount of cargo-carrying capacity for each of our ships and a reduction in capacity may result in a reduction of the fees payable to us under such agreement.
Our space charter agreement with Nor Lines expires in December 2019, in line with the expiration of our Coastal Service Contract.
Onboard and Other Revenue
We generate additional onboard revenue on our ships principally from beverage sales, specialty dining, shore excursions, gift shop purchases, cafeteria sales and other similar items. Onboard and other revenue is an important component of our revenue base representing 9.3% of our revenues from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. To maximize onboard revenue, we use various cross-marketing and promotional tools and are supported by point-of-sale systems that permit "cashless" transactions for the sale of these onboard products and services.
Spitsbergen Revenue Practices
Our Spitsbergen Travel segment derives revenues from the operation of our three hotels and our equipment store, Ingeniør G. Paulsen. Our hotel operations generate revenues primarily from room sales and food and beverage sales from restaurants at our hotels as well as sales of various adventure activities. We price our hotel rooms based on a flexible model, which allows us to adjust prices based on room category, season and utilization rates. These adjustments are implemented through various marketing programs including promotions and activities. Food and beverages are sold at fixed rates. We offer complete packages including meals and activities and also offer additional supplements for these products and services on site in order to optimize our sales.
Through our equipment store, we derive revenues from sale of unguided adventure activities, equipment rental and sale and repair of gear. Products and prices at our equipment store are based on products and services offered and season and can be adjusted through promotions or seasonal sales.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal in line with weather conditions, the holiday period in Europe and demand for coastal voyages. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated 65.0% of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast revenues during the second and third calendar quarters of 2014, which we promote as our "Midnight sun" season. Demand is strongest for cruises during Norway's summer months and holidays. Due to colder weather, we tend to generate comparatively lower revenues in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. Despite the seasonal nature of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast business, we are required by the Coastal Service Contract to operate daily between Bergen and Kirkenes throughout the year.
134

In recent years we have developed other seasonal concepts to complement our peak season theme, including, "Autumn Gold" in the fall, "Hunting the Light" in the winter and "Arctic Awakening" in spring. We use such seasonal concepts to attract customers seeking a travel and expedition experience that is only available during specific times of the year. For example, the number of PCNs we sold in January through March has increased by 9.3% in 2014 compared to 2011 and we believe this is largely due to the introduction of our seasonal concepts.
Our cruises through our MS Fram segment are operated on a seasonal basis. MS Fram sails in the Antarctic waters of the southern hemisphere November through March and during this time, our customers primarily comprise of German and United States guests. During the summer and fall months, MS Fram heads north to the Arctic seas around Greenland and Spitsbergen, where we have a more global customer mix. We change our itineraries every year to allow for variation and to appeal to our guests, including repeat customers. For the 2015 season, we have introduced a "Deeper into the Fjord" itinerary to strengthen our differentiation.
The main season for our three hotels in Spitsbergen under our Spitsbergen Travel segment is from March through August due to long sunlight hours during these months in this region and the European summer vacation period.
Our Guests For marketing and sales purposes and to develop the right products, we divide our guests (other than those
using our services for local transportation) into four categories, based on their main motivation for travelling as well as the activity levels they seek:
· Nature observers: "Nature observers" are mainly motivated to go on a Hurtigruten voyage or travel to Spitsbergen to observe the nature, scenery and wildlife in a relaxed atmosphere.
· Culture seekers: "Culture seekers" are mainly motivated to go on a Hurtigruten voyage or travel to Spitsbergen to experience and learn about the history, society and culture of a new and exotic destination.
· Activity engagers: "Activity engagers" are mainly motivated to go on a Hurtigruten voyage or travel to Spitsbergen to experience exciting activities.
· Expedition heroes: "Expedition heroes" are mainly motivated to go on a Hurtigruten voyage or travel to Spitsbergen to go on hikes, dog sledding, snowmobile and skiing expeditions over several days.
Despite differences between our main four guest categories, we believe that all our guests have similar traits, desire similar experiences on their vacation, and have similar interests. We aim to offer voyages and experiences that cater to these common interests, while utilizing our knowledge of their differences in our marketing campaigns to reach each segment through various channels of communication and messages.
Sales and Marketing Product Distribution Channels and Sales
We sell our product through our Norwegian and international travel agents as well as our own three customer reservation call centers ("Customer Reservation Call Centers") and, to a lesser extent, through our website. Travel agents can make bookings directly, either through our Customer Reservation Call Center or via our business online reservation systems ("B2B Reservation Systems"), which are exclusively available to our partnering travel agents. Our B2B Reservation Systems are used for bookings relating to coastal voyage guests, port-to-port guests, MS Fram guests, Spitsbergen Travel guests, group travels and excursions. Sales made by travel agents represent the majority of our ticket sales. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, bookings for our products were made through over 7,000 third parties, and therefore we are not dependent on any individual travel agent for a significant portion of our business. Our travel agents sell our itineraries on a nonexclusive, commission-based basis.
135

Our main Customer Reservation Call Center is based in Tallinn, Estonia. As part of our Efficiency Improvement Program, we established two smaller Customer Reservation Call Centers in order to better serve customers in specific regions. One of these two Customer Reservation Call Centers is based in Kirkenes, Norway, and serves our customers in Norway, and the other is based in Seattle, United States, as part of our sales and marketing office located there, and serves our customers in North America. In addition to travel agents, our Customer Reservation Call Center and sales and marketing offices are also used by our guests that would like to book directly with us. Bookings made through our Customer Reservation Call Centers account for the largest proportion of our overall bookings. The main function of our Customer Reservation Call Centers is to provide a phone booking service for our coastal voyages and MS Fram expeditions, as well as travel arrangements, including flights to the destinations from which we operate.
In the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated 70% of our pre-sold ticket revenues through third parties and 30% directly from end customers. Out of the 70% presold tickets through third parties, 73% were sold through our Customer Reservation Call Centers and the remaining 27% were made through our B2B Reservation Systems. Out of the 30% pre-sold tickets sold directly to end consumers, 66% were sold through our Customer Reservation Call Centers and the remaining 34% were sold through our B2B Reservation Systems.
In addition, we also operate five sales and marketing offices globally. Our sales and marketing offices are based in Hamburg, Oslo, London, Paris and Seattle. The prime focus for these sales offices is to develop and implement sales and marketing activities to enhance brand awareness and stimulate booking demand. Each sales and marketing office executes our global marketing plans on a local basis, by selecting activities and promotional materials in accordance with our global brand guidelines.
Marketing, Brand Communications and Advertising
We believe that we have a distinct tourist product and customer experience, which is based on a more extensive itinerary that offers a higher number of ports of call (including to some less-visited local ports), a cultural experience and a wide offering of nature-based and adventurous activities. Our advertising and communication strategy plays an important role in the promotion of our products and latest offers and in maintaining a distinct image for our brand.
Our global marketing department is based in Oslo and is responsible for working together with third-party advertising agencies to develop a global marketing and communications strategy, which strives to capture our brand proposition and to strengthen our global brand awareness. We adopt various marketing and communications strategies, which are tailored to appeal to each of our four categories of guests, as well as the geographies in which our guests are located. See "--Our Guests." Our global marketing and communications strategy is rolled out by each of our local sales and marketing offices using a selection of activities that appeal to their local markets.
Our global marketing department works to enhance our brand awareness and the appeal of our product offerings among guests, trade and travel partners. Core functions in our global marketing department include brand strategy, advertising and media, marketing communications, direct marketing, customer loyalty, ecommerce development and market research. Our marketing efforts seek to support our brand proposition of offering distinct, active and authentic exploration based voyages and experiences. We use various forms of media for our press and marketing activities and promotional offers including television, print, internet, social networking, radio, digital, e-mail and direct mail. In addition, our services are often reviewed by journalists and travel publications.
We customize our promotional activities for each of our product segments by producing individual marketing materials. We market each of our product segments according to its strengths and tailor our marketing campaigns to the preferences of the type of guests most likely to participate in that product segment. We create a specific marketing message for each of our segments and products; for example, Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast's products are named based on the season and what our guests will experience during the particular season, such as "Spring--Arctic Awakening," "Summer--Midnight Sun," "Autumn Gold" and "Winter--Hunting the Light."
Our e-commerce channel is operated through our websites, email communications and social media pages and accounts. We operate seven country-specific versions of our website, as well as one
136

global version. We are increasingly focused on digital sales and marketing communications. We provide updates regarding our latest product offerings and promotions and aim to increase traffic to our website. During 2015, we plan to launch a new e-commerce channel, including updated websites, a new booking platform, more information and content and increased functionality. We intend to introduce a more interactive and user friendly e-commerce platform that will facilitate the booking process for individuals and for the groups. Our new ecommerce channel will allow us to communicate with our guests before they sail on our ships as well as during and after their voyage with us. As part of this project, we will also establish digital channels for mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. We are establishing a direct dialog with our guests through email and chat communications, as well as maintaining social media communications through our own blogs, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. We believe that our social media presence facilitates interaction with our crew and explorer team members and improves brand awareness. We aim to make our e-commerce channel the primary sales and distribution channel and the primary source of information and marketing materials for our guests.
We believe we are one of Norway's longest established tourism providers and we work together with other travel and trade players as well as government agencies in Norway to develop Norwegian tourism internationally in order to attract more customers. We work with various airlines to try to increase the number of direct flights from abroad to coastal destinations in Norway in order to make the Norwegian coast more easily accessible. We seek to base our activities on sustainable and responsible behavior, which is important in maintaining the environmental stability of the geographies in which we operate.
Our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast product has won international recognition, including such accolades as the best specialist cruise company in the Travel Weekly Globe Awards of 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. We were named in the best niche cruise category of the British Travel Awards in 2008 (winner), 2009 (bronze medal), 2010 (silver medal) and in 2011 (bronze medal). In 2014, we received the Spa Travel Award for the Best Specialist Cruise Company, and in 2012, 2013 and 2014 we were named the Star Specialist Cruise Company in the Travel Bulletin Star Awards. In 2011, we received Hidden Gems and Best Shore Excursions Awards from Cruise International. In 2012, we won the Specialist Cruise Line of the Year award in the TTG Travel Awards and were recognized as the Best Specialist Cruise Line Operator for Groups in the Group Travel Awards. We were named Travel Product of the Year for 2013 and Best Ferry Operator in Norway in 2013 and 2014 in Norway's Grand Travel Awards. In 2014, we were recognized as the Best Specialist Cruise Operator of the Year by The Advantage Travel Partnership, named Best for Adventure in the Cruise Critic 2014, U.K. Editors' Picks Awards.
Insurance
Except for MS Lofoten and MS Vesterålen, we maintain hull and machinery insurance on all of our ships, based on market value. In the case of MS Lofoten and MS Vesterålen, due to the age of these ships, we maintain hull and machinery insurance for an amount less than their market value.
In addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery of our ships, we seek to maintain comprehensive, industry-standard insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business. The coverage includes:
· protection and indemnity insurance covering legal or contractual third-party liability arising from the operation of our ships, including insurance against liability for oil spills, cargo claims, collision, wreck removal as well as liability against personal injury and death (including of passengers and crew);
· war risk insurance on each ship in an amount equal to the total insured hull value, subject to certain coverage limits, deductibles and exclusions. The terms of our war risk policies include provisions whereby underwriters can give seven days' notice to the insured that the policies will be cancelled in the event of a change of risk or automatically in the event of any use of nuclear arms for war purposes or war between certain countries, which is standard for war risk policies in the maritime industry. Upon any proposed cancellation the insurer shall, before expiry of the seven day period, submit new proposed terms;
· off-hire insurance for our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships covering the period from April 15 through September 30 each year and for MS Fram throughout the year, covering lost income
137

up to certain maximum amounts resulting from a loss of income as a consequence of damage to a ship that prevents us from operating such ship;
· tour operator insurance; and
· insurance for our shore side property and general liability risks.
All of our insurance coverage is subject to market-standard limitations, exclusions and deductible levels.
We comply with Norwegian legislation implementing the Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea (1974) (the "Athens Convention"), the Protocol to the Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea (1976) (the "1976 Protocol"), the Protocol to the Athens Convention on November 1, 2002 (the "2002 Protocol"), which establishes a level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators with a right of direct action against the insurer, and the EU Passenger Liability Regulation, which requires us to carry a minimum level of financial responsibility per passenger per incident.

Employees
As of September 30, 2014 we employed 1,756 full time equivalent employees ("FTEs"), of which 824 were permanent employees in Norway, 695 temporary employees including apprentices and cadets accounted and the remaining 237 FTEs were employees of our sales organization outside Norway. The figures for Norway include Spitsbergen Travel and our Customer Reservation Call Center in Kirkenes, and the figures for our sales organization outside Norway include our Customer Reservation Call Centers in Tallinn and our sales and marketing offices in Hamburg, Oslo, London, Seattle (including the Customer Reservation Call Center) and Paris.

As of September 30, 2014, our 1,756 FTEs consisted of:

A large number of our employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. As of September 30, 2014, we were subject to five collective bargaining agreements, including three collective bargaining agreements for maritime crew and two collective bargaining agreements for land-based employees. One agreement was renegotiated at the end of 2013 and is scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. The other four agreements were renegotiated in 2014 and are scheduled to expire in April 2016. Such collective bargaining agreements cannot be renegotiated prior to their expiry.

In addition, pursuant to our Coastal Service Contract, all our employees who are directly engaged in fulfilling our obligations under our Coastal Service Contract are required to have employment terms equal to or better than the terms set out in national collective bargaining agreements for the relevant type of employee and common market practice.

We have not experienced any significant work stoppages in recent years. Certain of our employees are members of trade unions and we meet with certain union leaders on a quarterly basis. We believe we generally have good relationships with our employees and unions.

Property and Equipment
Information about our cruise ships, including their size and primary areas of operation, as well as information regarding our ship maintenance and estimated expenditures may be found under "--Our Fleet," "-- Ship Operations--Maintenance" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources--Net Cash Flows From Investing Activities." Information about environmental regulations may be found under "--Legal and Regulatory--Environment."

In addition to the properties we ground lease in Spitsbergen, we own three properties in Norway. Two of these properties were previously used as accommodations for our employees between voyages but since 2009 have been leased to an independent third party and are no longer used in our operations. The third property is used as a warehouse for spare parts for our ships.

We own all of the buildings used for our Spitsbergen Travel hotel and guest house operations in Longyearbyen, Svalbard, except for one of the four buildings used for the Spitsbergen Guest House, which we lease under a long-term contract, which expires in 2022. The buildings are located on land leased from the Norwegian government under long-term contracts.

As part of the Efficiency Improvement Program, we established a corporate center, including our head office, in new leased premises in the city center in Tromsø. We also lease sales and marketing offices and Customer Reservation Centers in Oslo, Kirkenes, Hamburg, Tallinn, Paris and London, and we receive office space in Seattle as part of a sales and marketing services agreement with one of our suppliers. Our lease agreements have varying payment terms, price adjustment clauses and renewal rights.

(1) Unless terminated at least six months prior thereto, the lease will automatically be renewed for a five-year renewal term, commencing on August 1, 2018.

As part of our ongoing initiatives in connection with the Efficiency Improvement Program, we constantly evaluate our property portfolio to determine whether certain leased offices meet our needs. As a result of such evaluation, we may relocate certain sale offices to more suitable properties over the course of 2015.

We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs, and that we are capable of obtaining additional facilities as necessary.

Intellectual Property
We own a number of registered trademarks and logos relating to, among other things, our brand name, corporate logo and domain name. We believe that such trademarks and logos are widely recognized and have considerable value. In particular, we own the trademark of Hurtigruten; we have not licensed this core trademark to any third parties and do not intend to do so in the future.

Legal and Regulatory
Registration of Our Ships
The Norwegian ship registries consist of the Norwegian Ordinary Ship Register ("NOR") and the Norwegian International Ship Register ("NIS"). Ships registered in NIS are not permitted to carry cargo or passengers between Norwegian ports or to engage in regular scheduled passenger transport between Norway and foreign ports.
Our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships are registered in NOR and are inspected at least annually pursuant to NOR requirements. MS Fram is registered in NIS and is inspected at least annually pursuant to NIS requirements. In addition, we hold a license to operate as a passenger transporter on the coastal route between Bergen and Kirkenes and all our ships are classified as "car ferries," which together allow us to offer our guests to bring their car with them when travelling on our ships.
For the past 10 years, we have been involved in ongoing discussions with the NMD regarding whether our single compartment ships are to be classified as "car ferries" or "passenger ships." The two classifications are subject to different regulatory requirements regarding safety and have separate minimum capacity requirements. The ships in question were built prior to the time the current requirements came into effect and we have sought to have our ships classified as "passenger ships", which, among other things, requires compliance with SOLAS requirements for such ships. If a reclassification of these ships as "passenger ships" is not approved, we may be required to reduce the passenger and crew count permitted to be transported on these ships. Alternatively, if the ships are classified as "car ferries," we could be required to redesign our ships, with estimated future rebuild costs of NOK 2.0 million to NOK 20.0 million per ship. The ongoing discussions with the NMD are related to the technical design solutions for these design modifications.
One of our ships, MS Richard With, has already been redesigned and approved by the NMD. For our other single compartment ships; MS Polarlys, MS Nordlys, MS Nordkapp, MS Kong Harald, MS Nordnorge and MS Vesterålen, we have proposed alternative modifications to improve safety levels and cargo utilization that can be undertaken at a lower cost compared to the modifications we have made to MS Richard With. In addition, any reduction of cargo-carrying capacity on our ships as a result of modifications to comply with the 305 Classification may result in an amendment to the terms of our space charter agreement with Nor Lines. Our space charter agreement with Nor Lines specifies the amount of cargo-carrying capacity for each of our ships and a reduction in capacity may result in a reduction of the fees payable to us under such agreement.
Our single compartment ships are required to be reclassified before October 2015 in order to comply with the requirements under the 305 Classification. We expect that the capital expenditures in 2015 related to the redesign of these five ships with respect to the 305 Classification rebuild be in the range of approximately NOK 80 million to NOK 90 million, depending on the agreement we reach with the NMD. However, we expect that such capital expenditure would increase to an aggregate amount of approximately NOK 118 million and could require extended dry-docking times for each ship, possibly during our peak season, if the NMD does not agree to our alternative modifications and we are required to undertake modifications on all our single compartment ships that are similar in scope to the modifications we made to MS Richard With. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Net Cash Flows From Investing Activities."

Crew and Passenger Safety
Our entire fleet is subject to the health and safety laws and regulations of the various port locales where the ships dock. Norway is a member of the International Maritime Organization ("IMO") and has ratified and implemented the IMO conventions relating to ocean-going passenger ships.

We place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and crew. We prepare monthly health, safety

and environment reports that are presented to our corporate leadership team comprising of our CEO and six

members of our senior management team. Furthermore, through our quality assurance system, deviations from

established protocols, accidents and other safety incidents or concerns are reported and monitored. Our quality

management system is an approved ISM Code (as defined below) safety management system. We review safety

incident reports in order to detect any issues or concerns, to review safety recommendations, as well as to

implement

preventative

140

measures. We conduct internal and external audits, both onboard and in our headquarters, focusing on the safety and wellbeing of our guests and employees to monitor the effectiveness of our quality management system.
We operate all of our ships to comply with all applicable requirements for the safe operation at sea, including requirements of the SOLAS convention and the IMO International Safety Management Code ("ISM Code") as well as the International Convention for the Prevention of Oil Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), all as implemented in Norway. Our ships are required to comply with the ISM Code. In order to continue our ship operations, and to evidence our compliance with the ISM Code, our ships are required to undergo an annual inspection in order to obtain a renewed passenger ship safety certificate issued by the NMD. Our passenger ship safety certificate is subject to annual review of compliance conducted by the NMD, during which the NMD may identify items which need to be improved or addressed for us to operate in compliance with the ISM Code.
Furthermore our business operations are subject to an annual review by NMD in order to obtain a document of compliance. During such audits the NMD may identify items which need to be improved or addressed for us to operate in compliance with the ISM Code.
Every crew member undertakes safety training, participating in regular safety drills onboard every one of our ships. Pursuant to the rules of the ISM Code, we are required to have a "Designated Person Ashore," who has direct access to the highest level of management and whom any employee can contact regarding any material safety related issues on board the ship.
Pursuant to provisions adopted by the IMO and enacted in Norway, all passenger ships operating in Norwegian waters are required to comply with the requirements of the ISM Code. We have obtained certificates certifying that our ship safety management system is in compliance with the ISM Code. Each such certificate is granted for a five-year period and is subject to periodic verification.
We believe that our ships currently comply with all requirements of NOR, in the case of our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships, and NIS, in the case of MS Fram, including but not limited to legislation based on SOLAS. The international requirements are amended and extended by the IMO from time to time. For example, the International Ship and Port Facility Code ("ISPS Code"), which applies to our operation of MS Fram but not our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships, was adopted by the IMO in December 2002, and subsequently enacted in Norway. It provides new requirements for governments, port authorities and shipping companies in relation to security issues on ships and in ports. We comply with the ISPS Code for MS Fram.
IMO has also adopted an amendment to SOLAS which requires partial bulkheads on cabin balconies to be made of non-combustible construction. Existing ships are required to comply with this SOLAS amendment by the first statutory survey after July 1, 2008; all of our ships are in compliance with the SOLAS amendment.
Another new SOLAS regulation, on Long-Range Identification and Tracking ("LRIT"), applies to ships trading internationally and is therefore relevant to our operation of MS Fram but not our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships. It came into effect on January 1, 2008, and allows SOLAS contracting governments, including Norway, one year to set up and test the LRIT system, and ship operators one year to start fitting the necessary equipment or upgrading so that their ships can transmit LRIT information. MS Fram is fitted with this equipment and we are therefore in compliance with these requirements.
Our Captains are experienced and certified seafarers. To assist our Captains and Officers while at sea, we have extensive navigation protocols in place. Our bridge operations are based on a two-person team approach. Accordingly, there are always two officers present on the bridge, mandating strict adherence to operating procedures. Furthermore, our bridge teams follow pre-set voyage plans, which are thoroughly reviewed by the Captain and bridge team prior to port departures and arrivals.
For MS Fram, prior to every cruise setting sail, we hold a mandatory safety drill for all guests during which important safety information is reviewed and demonstrated. For the coastal fleet, we show an extensive safety video, which runs on television screens located in public areas. Our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire prevention and control systems.

Environment
Like all other transport and tourist activities, our operations have a direct influence on the natural environment. We are conscious of our responsibility for safe operation and environmental protection, and work continuously to improve our environmental performance. Our Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast ships are subject to requirements set out in SOLAS and Norwegian laws, and MS Fram is subject to international requirements, including under SOLAS. We are subject to review on a regular basis by both the NMD and the classification society, Det Norske Veritas Germanischer Lloyd, and we strive to comply with all such requirements in addition to environmental requirements on account of public opinion.
The scope of our business, and thereby our consumption of fossil fuel, is governed to a great extent by the public procurement contract for transport services with the Ministry of Transport for the Bergen-Kirkenes coastal service. Daily departures year-round and 11 ships in constant operation mean substantial fuel consumption and consequent discharges of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide ("NOx"). On the other hand, our substantial cargo business helps to reduce the burden on the Norwegian road network by carrying the equivalent of approximately 10,000 lorry-loads of goods in the year ended December 31, 2013. Increased cargo transport by sea is a national goal, and we work systematically together with Nor Lines to increase the volume of goods carried on our ships.
Pollution at sea from ships, including air pollution, is regulated by the IMO through the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships ("MARPOL"), and particularly Annex VI of MARPOL ("Annex VI"). Annex VI limits the permissible emissions of certain major air pollutants that originate from ships' exhaust gases, including SOx and NOx. It also prohibits deliberate emission of ozone depleting substances, including refrigerants such as Freon. MARPOL has been ratified by Norway and, by way of an EU/ EEA Directive, given the force of law in Norway. Compliance with the requirements of Annex VI is the responsibility of the ship owner and non-compliance could have significant legal and financial consequences for the owner.
We carefully monitor fuel consumption and emissions, and report on defined indicators at executive management meetings and board meetings. Choice of fuel is an important element in reducing emission risk. In compliance with the latest amendment to Annex VI, which came into effect on January 1, 2015, we are required to use fuel that does not exceed a sulphur content of 0.10% on the part of our route along the Norwegian coast which is located south of latitude 62 degrees north. The prior regulation under Annex VI allowed exhaust gas emissions up to a maximum of 1.5% sulphur for passenger ships. This recent amendment to Annex VI is expected to have little impact on our bunker fuel costs since we had previously used marine gas oil, which complies with the latest amendment, for all of our voyages.
We are a member of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise's ("NHO") NOx fund, which has an overall goal of achieving a reduction in such emissions from Norwegian industry and commerce. Through this fund, we have applied for support for more than 20 NOx-related projects. A number of measures have been implemented and completed. The estimated annual gain in terms of emissions from these measures is about 330 tons of NOx. As a member of the NHO NOx fund and signatory to an environmental agreement covering the period 2011­ 2017, we and the other signatories have undertaken to reduce our overall NOx emissions by 16,000 tons and to maintain the emission reductions achieved for the entire period. The NHO NOx fund has also reported that the targets for 2011 and 2012 were satisfied and that the achieved reductions to meet the 2013 and 2014 commitments are on track.
The Norwegian Environment Agency monitors whether individual reduction targets have been achieved. Deviations of more than 10.0% from reduction targets trigger a collective fine, under which businesses must pay the nitrogen oxide tax for their pro rata share of the target that has not been satisfied. However, the businesses will never pay more than the official government rate for nitrogen oxide tax.
Our explorer activities off Greenland, Spitsbergen and Antarctica are subject to guidelines from the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators ("IAATO") and the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators ("AECO"). We play an active role in both these organizations to champion a safe and environmentally conscious tourism industry in these distinct and vulnerable areas.
142

Legal Proceedings We currently are, and from time to time we may become, involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in
the ordinary course of our business, such as employee claims and disputes with port authorities. We are currently involved in a dispute with Stranda Hamnevesen KF regarding an increase in port taxes and fees charged by Stranda Hamnevesen KF in relation to the port in Geiranger. We successfully challenged the increase in port taxes and fees in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal. In December 2014, Stranda Hamnevesen KF appealed parts of the Court of Appeal's decision to the Supreme Court of Norway. If the appeal is accepted and the Supreme Court ultimately decides in favor of Stranda Hamnevesen KF, we could be liable for an amount of approximately NOK 2 million for outstanding fees for the period from 2012 to 2014 as well as legal costs. The final outcome of the dispute is also likely to impact the amount of port fees we will be charged in future periods at the port in Geiranger and elsewhere.
ESA State Aid Investigation In June and July 2014, the EFTA Surveillance Authority (the "ESA") contacted the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries (the "Ministry of Trade") regarding anonymous complaints the ESA had received regarding Hurtigruten. All the complaints relate to the provision of state aid to Hurtigruten under the Coastal Service Contract. In particular, such complaints alleged that Hurtigruten had not reserved the minimum number of berths required for the port-to-port guests, that Hurtigruten has reduced the service on a number of harbors in Finnmark without a corresponding reduction in fees payable to us under the Coastal Service Contract and that Hurtigruten has been overcompensated for the services we provide to the port-to-port guests under the Coastal Service Contract. To date, we have cooperated with the Norwegian government's requests for information in relation to the ESA inquiry; however no formal proceeding or investigation has been initiated. Any inquiry or proceeding would be made against the Ministry of Trade. However, to the extent that a formal proceeding or investigation is launched and the ESA finds that unlawful state aid has been granted to Hurtigruten, we may be required to modify our current practices, to agree to new terms and conditions or to pay a settlement amount, fee or penalty, in an amount representing the amount, which could be significant, of the illegal state aid received as determined by the ESA, plus interest, any of which may adversely impact our operations and financial position.

DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS
The following contains a summary of the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. Terms not otherwise defined in this section shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the same meanings set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement We are party to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement which provides for a committed 65 million
multicurrency senior revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), of which NOK 250.0 million was drawn on January 22, 2015 to be used in connection with the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions. The Revolving Credit Facility is available for utilization by way of revolving loans and letters of credit, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are used to finance or refinance the general corporate and working capital purposes of the "Restricted Group" (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) subject to certain prohibitions, such as on repayment of certain of our other indebtedness and payments of dividends.
The original borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility is the Company. The facility agent (the "Agent") under the Revolving Credit Facility is Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC.
Ancillary Facilities Subject to an aggregate limit of 50% of the total commitments (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) for the use of ancillary facilities under the Revolving Credit Facility, a lender may make available to a borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility all or part of that lender's undrawn commitment in the Revolving Credit Facility by way of ancillary facilities such as overdrafts, guarantees, short term loan facilities, derivatives and foreign exchange facilities, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent.
Repayments and Prepayments The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate on the six year anniversary of the Closing Date. Any amount
still outstanding at that time will be immediately due and payable.
Subject to certain conditions, we may voluntarily prepay our utilizations and/or permanently cancel all or part of the available commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by giving five business days' prior notice to the Agent.

Interest and Fees The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR/NIBOR/LIBOR (as
applicable) plus a margin of 3.75% per annum, subject to a margin ratchet based on the "Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio" at each quarter end. We are also required to pay a commitment fee, in arrears on the last day of each financial quarter during the availability period, on available but unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 40% of the applicable margin applicable to borrowings in euros under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.
We are also required to pay fees related to the issuance of ancillary facilities, letters of credit, and certain fees to the Agent and the Security Agent in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility.
Security and Guarantees Within 70 days of the Hurtigruten Tender Offer Settlement Date, the Revolving Credit Facility will be
guaranteed subject to certain customary limitations and agreed security principles, on a joint and several basis, by each of our subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the Notes.
151

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also provides that that as soon as practicable and in any event within 45 days of the date of delivery of a compliance certificate relating to the annual financial statements, the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of the guarantors is required to represent not less than 80% of the consolidated EBITDA of the "Restricted Group" (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), and the consolidated gross assets of the guarantors are required to represent not less than 80% of the consolidated gross assets of the "Restricted Group" (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).
On the Issue Date, the Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by the Issue Date Collateral and within 70 days of the Hurtigruten Tender Offer Settlement Date, the Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by the PostIssue Date Collateral (see "Intercreditor Agreement--Collateral").
Covenants
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains customary information and negative covenants (including restrictive covenants that largely replicate those contained in the Indenture), subject to certain agreed exceptions. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires the Company, each other Borrower (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and each guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to observe certain customary affirmative covenants and certain specific covenants in relation to the Hurtigruten Tender Offer.
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains a minimum EBITDA financial maintenance covenant.
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement allows members of the Restricted Group to prepay, purchase, defease or redeem (or otherwise retire for value) (each a "Repurchase") any of the Notes, any part of the Bridge Facility, Replacement Debt (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Term Debt (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) provided that (i) the aggregate value of all Repurchases does not exceed 35% of the total aggregate amount of the Notes, the Bridge Facility, the Replacement Debt and the Term Debt issued by the Restricted Group; and (ii) any prepayment, purchase, defeasement or redemption (or other retirement) of any part of the Bridge Facility, any Notes, Replacement Debt or Term Debt made solely with the proceeds of Additional Indebtedness (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) permitted to be incurred under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be treated as a Repurchase. In the event that the 35% threshold is exceeded (and only to the extent that that threshold is exceeded), the Restricted Group is obliged to match the Repurchase by a simultaneous cancellation and, if necessary, prepayment of an equal amount under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. No Repurchase may be made while an event of default is continuing or would result from such Repurchase.
Events of Default
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to agreed grace periods, thresholds and other qualifications), including a cross default with respect to an event of default under, and as defined in, the Notes Indenture, the occurrence of which would allow the lenders to accelerate all or part of the outstanding utilizations, terminate their commitments, declare all or part of their utilizations payable on demand and declare that cash cover in respect of letters of credit and ancillary facilities is immediately due and payable.
Governing Law
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with it will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English law, although the restrictive covenants, which are included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and largely replicate those contained in the Indenture, will be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by English law).
Intercreditor Agreement
The following summary of the Intercreditor Agreement refers to the Notes and the Indenture as they are defined in this offering memorandum.
152

In connection with entering into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and the Indenture, the Company and Silk Midco AS, among others, entered into an Intercreditor Agreement on October 6, 2014, as amended by an amendment agreement on January 9, 2015.
The Intercreditor Agreement governs the relationships and relative priorities among (i) the creditors of the Revolving Credit Facility (the "Lenders") and the creditors of the Bridge Facility; (ii) upon execution of an Intercreditor Accession Deed, the Trustee on behalf of itself and the holders of the Notes; (iii) future hedge counterparties under certain hedging agreements (the "Hedge Counterparties"); (iv) certain future creditors of the Restricted Group; (v) certain intra group creditors and debtors; (vi) various creditor representatives; and (vii) U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as the original Security Agent.
The Company and each of its subsidiaries that incur any liability or provide any guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture or the Pari Passu Debt (as defined below) documentation are referred to in this description as "Debtors."
The Intercreditor Agreement sets out:
1. the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;
2. the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors;
3. when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;
4. when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of certain indebtedness;
5. when enforcement action can be taken in respect of Notes Collateral;
6. the terms pursuant to which certain indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events;
7. turnover provisions; and
8. when security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of the Notes Collateral.
The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions relating to future indebtedness that may be incurred by the Debtors, provided that it is permitted by the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture, which may rank pari passu to the Notes and be secured by the Notes Collateral (the "Pari Passu Debt"), subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Creditors of the Pari Passu Debt (the "Pari Passu Creditors") have rights under the Intercreditor Agreement, which are summarized below.
The Intercreditor Agreement also allows (after all Credit Facility Liabilities (as defined below) have been fully and finally discharged) for the Debtors to enter into a new super senior credit facility, provided that the total amount outstanding under such facility is permitted under the Indenture. For the purposes of this description, any references to the Revolving Credit Facility or Lenders or Credit Facility Liabilities should be read as including any such other super senior credit facility.
By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement.
The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety nor does it describe provisions relating to the rights and obligations of holders of other classes of our debt. As such, we urge you to read the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines the rights of the holders of the Notes. Copies of the Intercreditor Agreement are available to holders of the Notes upon request. See "Listing and General Information."
Ranking and Priority
The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to the provisions regarding permitted payments and application of proceeds below, that the right and priority of payment of all present and future liabilities and obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility (the "Credit Facility Liability"), the hedging agreements entered into by the Hedge Counterparties (the "Hedging Liabilities"), the Notes (the "Notes Liabilities") and the Pari Passu Debt (the "Pari Passu Liabilities") rank pari passu in right and priority of payment without any preference or payment between them.
153

These liabilities rank ahead of any liabilities of the Debtors to the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Intra Group Liabilities") or any debt to a holding company, including Silk Midco AS (the "Structural Liabilities" and together with the Intra Group Liabilities, the "Subordinated Liabilities"). The Intercreditor Agreement does not rank the Subordinated Liabilities as between themselves.
Collateral
The Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties, the holders of the Notes and the Pari Passu Creditors will benefit from a common guarantee and security package and no such secured creditor may take the benefit of any guarantee or security from the Restricted Group, Silk Midco AS or the Company (other than any cash cover permitted under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or the Bridge Facility) unless such guarantee or security is also offered (to the extent legally possible and consistent with the Agreed Security Principles) for the benefit of the other secured creditors. The Notes Collateral shall rank and secure the liabilities owed to the Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties, the holders of the Notes and the Pari Passu Creditors pari passu and without any preference between them.
In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the guarantees and Notes Collateral will be released in certain circumstances described further below in "--Release of Security and Guarantees--Non-Distressed Disposals" and "--Release of Security and Guarantees--Distressed Disposals."
Permitted Payments
Prior to an acceleration event or enforcement of the Collateral, the Intercreditor Agreement will permit payments to be made by the Debtors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture and any Pari Passu Debt documentation and certain payments in respect of the Hedging Liabilities (provided that such payments are permitted under such documents) and does not limit or restrict any payment by any Debtor in the ordinary course of business. The Intercreditor Agreement also permits payments to lenders of Intra Group Liabilities, provided that there has been no acceleration or enforcement of the Collateral. Payments may be made in respect of Structural Liabilities to the extent not expressly prohibited by the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture and the Pari Passu Debt documentation, provided that there has been no acceleration or enforcement of the collateral. There are also restrictions on payments to Hedge Counterparties except for certain specified permitted payments.
The Debtors may not make payments in respect of the Hedging Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities or the Pari Passu Debt after an acceleration event or enforcement of the Notes Collateral unless in accordance with the enforcement proceeds waterfall described below under "--Application of proceeds."
The Intercreditor Agreement does not restrict the Debtors from making payments in respect of the Credit Facility Liabilities after an acceleration event or enforcement of the Notes Collateral.
An acceleration event includes the relevant creditor representative exercising any or all of its rights under the acceleration provisions of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (which includes placing on demand of liabilities thereunder), the Indenture or the Pari Passu Debt documentation.
Limitations on Enforcement
For the purposes of enforcement of the Notes Collateral, the Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties (to the extent they are owed Hedging Liabilities (i) in respect of the Bridge Facility or the Notes (the "Senior Notes/ Bridge Hedging Liabilities") or (ii) (a) not exceeding an aggregate maximum amount of 30 million (excluding the Senior Notes/Bridge Hedging Liabilities) (the "Super Senior Hedging Amount") and (b) in respect of each such Hedge Counterparty, not exceeding the portion of the Super Senior Hedging Amount as has been allocated to such Hedge Counterparty by the Company, each calculated by reference to the mark-to-market valuation of the Hedging Liabilities, as at the date the calculation is required to be made under the Intercreditor Agreement (together, the "Super Senior Hedging Liabilities")) (the "Super Senior Hedge Counterparties") and their creditor representatives are referred to as the "Super Senior Creditors."
154

Subject to the Notes Collateral becoming enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Instructing Group (as set out in "--Conflicting Enforcement Instructions" below) may give instructions to the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the Notes Collateral provided they are consistent with the security enforcement principles. If a Creditor Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) wishes to enforce the Notes Collateral, either (a) 662/3% by commitment value of the Super Senior Creditors (the "Majority Super Senior Creditors"); or (b) the Senior Secured Required Holders (as set out below) must give notice of the proposed enforcement instructions to their respective creditor representatives; such creditor representatives are required to deliver a copy of such notice (the "Initial Enforcement Notice") to the Security Agent and the Security Agent is required to forward such notice to the creditor representatives for the other creditor classes and the Hedge Counterparties.
If the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Senior Required Holders (acting reasonably) consider that the Security Agent is not enforcing the Notes Collateral in a manner which is consistent with the security enforcement principles, notice of this shall be delivered by the relevant Creditor Group's creditor representative to the other creditor representatives. The giving of this notice triggers a 10 day consultation period during which time the creditor representatives for each of the creditor classes shall discuss with a view to agreeing the manner of enforcement.
The "Senior Secured Required Holders" are determined as follows:
(a) if there are no Pari Passu Creditors, it will be a simple majority of a combined class of holders of the Notes and the Non-Super Senior Hedge Counterparties (as defined below); or
(b) in any other case, it will be a simple majority of a combined class of holders of the Notes, the Non-Super Senior Hedge Counterparties and Pari Passu Creditors (provided that any Pari Passu Creditors in respect of any tranche of Pari Passu Debt with aggregate Pari Passu Liabilities owed to them or undrawn commitments under that tranche of less than 25 million shall not be entitled to vote in such class).
"Non-Super Senior Hedge Counterparties" means each Hedge Counterparty to the extent it is owed Hedging Liabilities which are not Super Senior Hedging Liabilities.
Conflicting Enforcement Instructions
The Security Agent must act on the instructions of the Instructing Group. The Instructing Group consists of (i) the Majority Super Senior Creditors and (ii) the Senior Secured Required Holders.
If there are conflicting enforcement instructions given to the Security Agent by the different classes of creditors who can constitute the Instructing Group, then provided such enforcement instructions are consistent with the security enforcement principles, the enforcement instructions from the Senior Secured Required Holders will prevail over those of the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Required Holders will constitute the Instructing Group. Failure by a class of creditors to give instructions will not be deemed to be an instruction that conflicts with any other enforcement instructions. After the Security Agent has commenced enforcement over the Collateral, it will not accept any subsequent instructions from anyone other than the Instructing Group that instructed it to take such action, except as described in the paragraph below.
If the relevant creditor group is the Senior Secured Required Holders and either:
1. within three months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Senior Secured Required Holders have not either (i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue (and in writing notified the Security Agent of that determination), or (ii) appointed a financial advisor to assist them in making such a determination; or
2. the Super Senior Creditors have not been repaid in full within six months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice; or
3. (a) the Senior Secured Required Holders have not either (i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue (and in writing notified the Security Agent of that determination), or (ii) appointed a financial advisor to assist them in making such a determination; and
(b) the Majority Super Senior Creditors (i) determine in good faith that a delay to issuing instructions as to enforcement could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
155

effect on the ability to effect a distressed disposal or on the expected realization proceeds of any enforcement and (ii) deliver enforcement instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the security enforcement principles, before the Security Agent has received any enforcement instructions from the Senior Secured Required Holders; or
4. an insolvency event (other than an insolvency event directly caused by any enforcement action taken by the Security Agent) is continuing with respect to a Debtor, then to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors elect to provide enforcement instructions,
any enforcement instructions given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will then prevail, provided that they are consistent with the security enforcement principles.
Any enforcement instructions given must comply with certain security enforcement principles including the following:
1. the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement is to achieve the security enforcement objective, namely to maximize, so far as consistent with prompt and expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the Notes Collateral, the recovery of all of the secured parties (provided that the security enforcement objective shall cease to be operative six months after the date of the first enforcement instructions unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree);
2. all enforcement proceeds will be received in cash by the Security Agent or sufficient enforcement proceeds will be received in cash by the Security Agent to ensure that after distribution in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit Facility Liabilities will be repaid in full (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise));
3. to the extent that the enforcement is over Notes Collateral with an aggregate book value exceeding 2.5 million or over shares in any member of the Restricted Group, the Security Agent shall obtain an opinion from a recognized independent investment bank or other reputable independent third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing valuations of the relevant type and size of assets, that the consideration from such enforcement is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances (the "Financial Advisor Opinion");
4. the Financial Advisor's Opinion will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Principles have been met; and
5. if any enforcement action is conducted by way of public auction in any jurisdiction, no Financial Advisor needs to be appointed in respect of such enforcement action.
Turnover
Subject to certain exclusions, if any holders of the Notes, Lender, Pari Passu Creditor, Hedge Counterparty (or any of their respective creditor representatives) receives or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of any Collateral except in accordance with "--Application of Proceeds" below, that person must:
1. in relation to amounts not received or recovered by way of set off, hold that amount on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay an amount equal to that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and
2. in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set off, promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Trustee shall only have an obligation to turn over or repay amounts received or recovered by it as described above (a) (i) if it had actual knowledge that the receipt or recovery is an amount received in breach of a provision of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) to the extent that, prior to receiving that knowledge, it has not distributed the amount of that receipt to the holders of the Notes in accordance with the Indenture or (b) if, prior to distribution of the relevant amount, it has received at least two Business Days' prior notice that an acceleration event or insolvency event has occurred in relation to any Debtor or that the receipt or recovery is subject to the turnover obligations in the Intercreditor Agreement. A similar protection exists for any trustees of Pari Passu Debt.
156

There is also a general turnover obligation on the subordinated creditors to turnover all amounts not received in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.
Application of Proceeds
All amounts from time to time recovered by the Security Agent in connection with the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the Notes Collateral or distressed disposal shall be held by the Security Agent on trust and applied in the following order:
1. first, pro rata and pari passu, in payment of all unpaid costs, expenses and liabilities owing to the Trustee, the creditor representative for the Pari Passu Creditors, the Security Agent, each other creditor representative and any receiver or delegate
2. second, pro rata and pari passu, in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Super Senior Creditors in connection with the enforcement of the Notes Collateral or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent;
3. third, pro rata and pari passu, in payment to the agent of the Lenders for its own behalf and on behalf of the arrangers of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Lenders for application towards the discharge of the Credit Facility Liabilities and to each Super Senior Hedge Counterparty for application toward the discharge of the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities;
4. fourth, pro rata and pari passu, in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the holders of the Notes each Non-Super Senior Hedge Counterparty and the Pari Passu Creditors in connection with the enforcement of the Collateral or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent;
5. fifth, pro rata and pari passu, in payment to (i) the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes for application towards the discharge of the Notes Liabilities in accordance with the Indenture ; (ii) each Super Senior Hedge Counterparty for application towards the discharge of any Hedging Liabilities in excess of the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities; (iii) each Non-Super Senior Hedge Counterparty for application of the discharge of the Hedge Liabilities which are not Super Senior Hedging Liabilities; and (iv) the creditor representatives of the Pari Passu Creditors for application towards the discharge of the Pari Passu Debt; and
6. sixth, after all the secured creditors have been repaid in full, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant Debtor or other person entitled to it.
Option to Purchase
The holders of the Notes and Pari Passu Creditors, which are holders of certain issued debt securities, may, after delivery of an Initial Enforcement Notice by any Lenders, and subject to various conditions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (including the grant of an acceptable indemnity against claw back to the Lenders and Pari Passu Loan Creditors), exercise an option to purchase the Credit Facility Liabilities in full and at par.
Release of Security and Guarantees--Non-Distressed Disposals
In circumstances where a disposal is not a distressed disposal (and is otherwise permitted by the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture and any Pari Passu Debt documentation), the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent is authorized:
(a) to release the Notes Collateral or any other claim over the relevant asset; and
(b) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or a holding company of a Debtor, to release the Notes Collateral or any other claim over that holding company's or Debtor's assets and the assets of any of their subsidiaries,
provided that in the case of a disposal to another member of the Restricted Group, any required replacement security is granted by the transferee before or at the same time as the release.
If required by the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture or Pari Passu Documents, any proceeds from a disposal that does not constitute a distressed disposal shall be applied in mandatory prepayment of the relevant debt.
157

Release of Security and Guarantees--Distressed Disposals
In circumstances where a distressed disposal is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent is authorized:
(a) to release the Notes Collateral or any other claim over the relevant asset;
(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release (a) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, guaranteeing liabilities (including in relation to the Notes) and certain other liabilities; (b) any Notes Collateral granted over that Debtor's assets and the assets of any of its subsidiaries; and (c) any other claim of a Debtor or intra group lender over that Debtor's assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor;
(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor, to release (a) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, guaranteeing liabilities (including in relation to the Notes) and certain other liabilities; (b) any Notes Collateral granted over the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company; and (c) any other claim of a Debtor or intra group lender over the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company;
(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding company of a Debtor, to dispose of all or any part of that Debtor's or the holding company that Debtor's borrowing liabilities, guaranteeing liabilities (including in relation to the Notes) and certain other liabilities; and
(e) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding company of a Debtor, to transfer Intra Group Liabilities and debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding company of a Debtor to another Debtor.
Any net proceeds of the disposal must be applied in accordance with the enforcement proceeds waterfall described above under "--Application of Proceeds."
Amendment
The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended with the consent of only the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the required percentage of the combined class of the holders of the Notes and the Non-Super Senior Hedge Counterparties (as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement), the required percentage of Pari Passu Creditors (as set out in the relevant Pari Passu Debt documentation), the Company and the Security Agent unless the proposed amendment relates to certain specified matters such as ranking, priority, subordination, turnover, enforcement, disposal proceeds, amendments or the payment waterfall. Such amendments require consent from all Super Senior Creditors, the required percentage of holders of the Notes (as set out in the Indenture), the required percentage of Pari Passu Creditors (as set out in the relevant Pari Passu Debt documentation), and each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent such amendments adversely affect it or relate to the nature or scope of Collateral), the Company and the Security Agent.
No amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement may impose new or additional obligations on or withdraw or reduce the rights of any party (other than in a way which affects creditors of that party's class generally) to the Intercreditor Agreement without the prior consent of that party.
The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended without the consent of the holders of the Notes in certain circumstances set out further in "Description of the Notes--Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements" below.
To the extent the Debtors wish to enter into Pari Passu Debt or other additional or replacement indebtedness ("Additional Indebtedness") which is permitted to share in the Notes Collateral pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture and any other Pari Passu Debt documentation, then the parties to the Intercreditor Agreement may be required to enter into a replacement intercreditor agreement as set out further in "Description of the Notes--Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements" below on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement.
158

The Intercreditor Agreement also permits the Security Agent (subject to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) to enter into new or supplemental security and/or release and retake the Notes Collateral if certain conditions are met, set out further in "Description of the Notes--Certain Covenants--Impairment of Security Interest" below. Bridge Facility Agreement
A Bridge Facility Agreement in the committed amount of up to 455.0 million was entered into on October 6, 2014 between the Company as borrower, Silk Midco AS, as parent, Goldman Sachs International as mandated lead arranger, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC as agent and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as security agent. The Bridge Facility Agreement contains covenants that are similar to the Revolving Credit Facility. The borrowings under the Bridge Facility will be repaid with the proceeds of this Offering. See "Use of Proceeds."
159

DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES
The Company issued and the Guarantors guaranteed 455 million aggregate principal amount of 7.50% senior secured notes due 2022 (the "Notes") in this Offering. The Notes were issued by Silk Bidco AS (the "Company"), a private limited company incorporated under the laws of Norway, which has no operations and no assets other than the shares of Hurtigruten ASA ("Hurtigruten") and its rights under the on-loans of proceeds to Hurtigruten pursuant to the Proceeds Loan Agreement (as defined herein).
The proceeds of the Offering sold on the Issue Date are used by the Company to repay existing indebtedness under the Bridge Facility Agreement owed by the Company and to pay fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing Transactions, as set forth in "Use of Proceeds."
Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes are obligations of the Company. Within 70 days from the Hurtigruten Tender Offer Settlement Date (the "Backstop Date"), the Guarantors specified below under "--Notes Guarantees" became a party to the Indenture (as defined herein) and guaranteed the Notes on a senior secured basis.
The Company issued the Notes under an indenture dated as of the Issue Date (the "Indenture") among, inter alios, the Company and the Trustee. The Guarantors will become parties to the Indenture upon their accession thereto. The Notes will be issued in private transactions that are not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See "Transfer Restrictions." The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate provisions by reference to or otherwise be subject to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
The Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) entered into in the future pursuant to "--Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements." The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. Please see "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement " for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement. This description does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement will be available as set forth below under "Where You Can Find More Information."
Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under "--Certain Definitions " have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading "--Certain Definitions." In this "Description of the Notes," the "Company" refers only to Silk Bidco AS and any successor obligor to Silk Bidco AS on the Notes and not to any of its subsidiaries and "Hurtigruten " refers only to Hurtigruten ASA and any successor obligor to Hurtigruten ASA on its Notes Guarantee (as defined below) and not to any of its subsidiaries. Hurtigruten is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under the Indenture.
Summary Description of the Notes
The Notes
· are senior obligations of the Company and rank equal in right of payment with any existing or future Indebtedness of the Company that is not expressly subordinated to the Notes;
· are secured by the Collateral described below, along with obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (although any liabilities in respect of obligations under the
160

Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other future Indebtedness that are secured by the Collateral will receive priority over the Holders with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over the Collateral);
· are senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined herein) of the Company;
· are effectively senior in right of payment to any existing or future unsecured obligations of the Company to the extent of the value of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes; and
· following the Backstop Date, will be unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors, which guarantees may be subject to the guarantee limitations described in this Offering Memorandum.
Principal and Maturity
On the Issue Date, the Company will issue 455 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes will mature on February 1, 2022. The repayment price of the Notes is 100.000%. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of 100,000 and in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.
Interest
Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 7.50% per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable, in cash, semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on August 1, 2015 to holders of record on the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15, respectively. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.
Additional Notes
The Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, but this issuance of Notes is limited to 455 million aggregate principal amount of Notes (the "Initial Notes").
From time to time, subject to the Company's compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenants restricting the incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below under the heading "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Indebtedness "), the Company is permitted to issue additional Notes, which shall have terms substantially identical to the Initial Notes except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer's Certificate supplied to the Trustee (the "Additional Notes"):
(1) the title of such Additional Notes;
(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;
(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;
(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;
(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be payable;
161

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;
(7) if other than denominations of 100,000 and in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and
(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional Notes.
Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other series of Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for such series. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this "Description of the Notes," references to "Notes " shall be deemed to include references to the Initial Notes as well as any Additional Notes. For all purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Initial Notes and any Additional Notes shall be deemed to form one series, and references to the "Notes " shall be deemed to refer to the Initial Notes as well as any Additional Notes. In the event that any Additional Notes are not fungible with any Notes previously issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such non-fungible Additional Notes shall be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number, as applicable, so that they are distinguishable from such previously issued Notes.
Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes
Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (as defined under "--Additional Amounts "), if any, on the Global Notes (as defined under "--Transfer and Exchange ") will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents (as defined under "--Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes "); provided that all such payments with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held by the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.
Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities ("Definitive Registered Notes ") will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents in the city of London maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by check mailed to the Person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See "--Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes."
Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes
The Company will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a "Paying Agent ") for the Notes, including a Paying Agent in London, United Kingdom. The Company will also undertake to maintain a Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC regarding the taxation of savings income or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meetings of 26 and 27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income (the "Taxation Directive "), or any law implementing, or complying with or introduced in order to conform to the Taxation Directive. The initial Paying Agent for the Notes will be Elavon Financial Services Limited, UK Branch.
The Company will also maintain (i) one or more registrars (each, a "Registrar") with offices in Dublin, Ireland and (ii) a transfer agent in London, United Kingdom (the "Transfer Agent "). The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services Limited. The initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial Services Limited, UK Branch. The Registrar, the Paying Agent and the Transfer Agent, as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Company. The Transfer Agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.
The Company may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the "LxSE") and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF of the LxSE and the rules of such exchange so require, the Company will publish a notice of any change of Paying
162

Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a daily newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.
Transfer and Exchange
The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as follows:
· Each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "144A Global Notes").
· The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.
· Each series of Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "Regulation S Global Notes" and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the "Global Notes").
· The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.
Ownership of interests in the Global Notes ("Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to Persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under "Transfer Restrictions." In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.
Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.
Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Book-Entry Interests in Regulation S Global Notes will be limited to Persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a Person who the transferor reasonably believes is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under "Transfer Restrictions" and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.
Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of 100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry
163

Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under "Transfer Restrictions."
Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of 100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes:
(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Notes;
(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Notes to be redeemed in part;
(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable to such Notes; or
(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer (as defined under "--Change of Control") or an Asset Disposition Offer (as defined under "-- Certain Covenants--Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock").
The Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent will be entitled to treat the Holder as the owner of it for all purposes.

Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries
Immediately after the issuance of the Notes, all the Company's Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. In the circumstances described below under the definition of "Unrestricted Subsidiary," the Company will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants contained in the Indenture.

Notes Guarantees
The obligations of the Company pursuant to the Notes will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior basis by Hurtigruten and each subsidiary of Hurtigruten that is a guarantor under the Revolving Facility Agreement (each a "Guarantor" and such guarantee, a "Notes Guarantee").

The initial Guarantors and their respective jurisdictions of incorporation will be as follows:

Norway Norway Norway Norway Norway

Each of the initial Guarantors will guarantee the Notes on or prior to the Backstop Date. As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, the Guarantors generated 113% and 101% of the consolidated revenues and EBITDA of the Restricted Subsidiaries, respectively, and represented 104% of the consolidated total assets of the Restricted Subsidiaries.

164

In addition, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, if the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries acquires or creates a Restricted Subsidiary (other than an Immaterial Subsidiary) after the Issue Date or any Restricted Subsidiary guarantees or becomes liable for certain Indebtedness, the Company will cause such new Subsidiary to provide a Subsidiary Notes Guarantee. The new Guarantor will also, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, be required to pledge its material assets that are of the same type as any of the Company's or the Guarantors' assets that are required to be part of the Notes Collateral as of the Issue Date or the Backstop Date, as applicable, in favor of the Notes Guarantees as described under "--Security."
The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, "thin capitalization" rules, retention of title claims and similar matters.
In particular, Norway has mandatory restrictions on financial assistance, which means the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees will not effectively secure any part of the Notes which has been (or will be) used to refinance any part of the existing indebtedness originally incurred and used to acquire the share capital of Hurtigruten. The Notes Guarantees are limited by mandatory provisions of law applicable to Guarantors formed in Norway limiting the legal capacity or ability of such Guarantors to provide Notes Guarantees pursuant to, inter alia, Sections 8-7 and 8-10, cf. 1-3 and 1-4, of the Norwegian Companies Acts of 1997. As a consequence of the above restrictions, the value of a Notes Guarantee and any security provided by a Norwegian guarantor may be reduced to zero to the extent it secures obligations relating to the acquisition of shares in itself or its parent company. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor's obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. The Notes Guarantees to be granted by Guarantors organized under the laws of Norway will be limited by financial assistance, among other limitations, which may substantially limit their value. The Notes Guarantees given by the Guarantors organized under the laws of Norway will be limited to the principal amount of the Notes less an amount of 133.7 million, reflecting the Notes proceeds which will be used to refinance acquisition debt drawn under the Bridge Facility in order to finance the Hurtigruten Acquisition.
Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor's obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor's obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See "Risk Factors-- Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure--The Notes Guarantees will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability."
The Notes Guarantees of a Guarantor will terminate and release upon:
(1) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor or of a Parent thereof, such that such Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the relevant Guarantor (other than to the Company, a Successor Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case in a transaction otherwise permitted by the Indenture;
(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the relevant Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;
(3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in "--Defeasance" and "--Satisfaction and Discharge ";
(4) to the extent that the relevant Guarantor is not an Immaterial Subsidiary solely due to the operation of clause (i) of the definition of "Immaterial Subsidiary," upon the relevant release of the guarantee or discharge of Indebtedness referred to in such clause;
(5) upon full payment of all obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes; or
(6) in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain of our Secured Indebtedness as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement.
165

Substantially all the operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company, including Holders or the claims made under the Proceeds Loan. The Notes, each Notes Guarantee and the Proceeds Loan therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of any future Subsidiaries of the Company that do not become Guarantors.
Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by the Company or Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture and does not impose any limitation on the issuance by the Company of any Preferred Stock. See "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Indebtedness."
Security
The Collateral
On the Issue Date, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, the Company will grant in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the secured parties (which includes the Trustee on behalf of the Holders), security on a first ranking basis, over substantially all of the assets of the Company, including: shares of capital stock of Hurtigruten; certain bank accounts, certain intra-group receivables (including the rights of the Company under the Proceeds Loan); the securities register account of the Company opened with Verdipapirsentralen ASA; and an assignment of claims under the settlement agreement in connection with the Hurtigruten Acquisition, and Silk Midco AS will grant in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the secured parties (which includes the Trustee on behalf of the Holders), security on a first ranking basis, over substantially all of the assets of Silk Midco AS, including: shares of capital stock of the Company and certain intra-group receivables (together, the "Initial Collateral ").
On or prior to the Backstop Date, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, Hurtigruten, Spitsbergen Travel AS, Ingeniør G Paulsen AS, Hurtigruten Sjø AS and Hurtigruten Pluss AS will grant in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the secured parties (which includes the Trustee on behalf of the Holders), security on a first ranking basis over its material assets, including: shares of capital stock of the Guarantors; certain bank accounts; intra-group receivables; an assignment of insurance claims in respect of certain ships and any other insurance claims the Guarantors may have (if applicable); claims under the Coastal Service Contract; a pledge of customer receivables (factoring), inventory and machinery and plant (including intellectual property); and mortgages over certain ships owned by the Guarantors (collectively with the Initial Collateral, the "Collateral").
Each of the Security Documents will be governed by Norwegian law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets may not be secured or such security may not be perfected in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including:
· if the cost of providing security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders and the other secured parties;
· if the asset is subject to a third party arrangement, which is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement, that prevents such security from being taken; provided that reasonable endeavors are taken to obtain consent for taking such security;
· if providing such security would be prohibited by general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance rules, fraudulent preference, "thin capitalization" rules or similar matters or entering into the Security Documents would conflict with fiduciary duties of directors, contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of directors or officers;
· if perfecting such security would have an unreasonable adverse effect on the ability of such Subsidiary to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Indenture (in which case, security will not be perfected prior to an acceleration event);
166

· if in certain jurisdictions it may not be possible to create security over certain assets, security will not be taken over such assets; and
· in the case of bank accounts, notices to the banks with whom the accounts are maintained will only be served after a "Relevant Acceleration Event " (as defined in the Agreed Security Principles).
Norway has mandatory restrictions on financial assistance, which means the Collateral will not effectively secure any part of the Notes which has been (or will be) used to refinance any part of the existing indebtedness originally incurred and used to acquire the share capital of Hurtigruten. The Collateral will be limited by mandatory provisions of law applicable to Guarantors formed in Norway limiting the legal capacity or ability of such Guarantors to provide security pursuant to, inter alia, Sections 8-7 and 8-10, cf. 1-3 and 1-4, of the Norwegian Companies Acts of 1997. See "--Notes Guarantees".
Administration and Enforcement of Security
The Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by a Security Agent (or in certain circumstances a receiver or delegate) pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of all the secured parties. For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement."
The ability of Holders to realize the Collateral will be subject to various insolvency law limitations in the event of the Company's insolvency and various contractual limitations set out in the Intercreditor Agreement. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure--The insolvency laws of Norway may not be as favorable to holders of Notes as U.S. insolvency laws or those of another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar" and "Risk factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure--The Notes Guarantees will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability."
The Security Documents will provide that the rights of the Holders with respect to the Collateral must be exercised by the Security Agent. Since the Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. Under the Note Documents, the Holders may only act through the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable. The Security Agent will agree to release a security interest created by the Security Documents that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the Holders. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, the Holders will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to direct the Trustee to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action under the Security Documents. Please see "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement."
The concept of a security trustee, as it is understood under U.S. law, does not exist under Norwegian law. In Norway, a security trustee would be considered to be acting as a security agent. In practice in Norway, in an arrangement with a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties, as these exist from time to time, it is generally recognized under Norwegian law that the security agent will be able to enforce the security on behalf of the secured parties and apply any proceeds to the secured parties. In order to commence any legal action regarding a claim (for enforcement purposes or otherwise) against the debtor, the security agent may be required to disclose to the court the identity of the creditors and have the creditors join in or participate as claimants in the proceedings. It has been established by the Norwegian Supreme Court that a bond trustee for an undisclosed number of noteholders can, based on the provisions in the relevant bond agreement or indenture, take legal action against the issuer on behalf of and in lieu of the noteholders without having to disclose the identity of the noteholders. However, the relevant Norwegian court would have to examine the relevant indenture together with the other relevant agreements relating to the Notes and this Offering to determine whether the Trustee would be able to act in such capacity.
Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Company and the Guarantors will have the right to remain in possession and retain control of the Collateral securing the Notes (other than as set
167

forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.
No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral remaining after the payment of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or other super priority obligations would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders as well as any other obligations secured on a pari passu basis. By its nature, some or all the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all. See "Risk factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure--No appraisals of any of the Notes Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the issuance of the Notes. The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Notes Collateral that has been granted as security for the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, and the Notes Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes and the Notes Guarantee."
The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and, by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have:
· irrevocably appointed U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as Security Agent, in each case to act as its security agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which the security agent is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents);
· irrevocably authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to each of them under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which the Security Agent and/or the Trustee is a party, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document expressed to be executed by the Security Agent and/or the Trustee on its behalf; and
· accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
In addition, the terms of the Security Documents and/or the nature of the security interest granted may provide for (or result in) certain assets originally the subject of a security interest being released from that security without the need for a formal release. Further, assets which may not be validly secured or assets which are already subject to certain types of Permitted Liens may be excluded from the security created by certain Security Documents.
Release of Liens
To the extent a release is required by a Security Document, the Security Agent shall release, and the Trustee (as applicable) shall release and if so requested direct the Security Agent to release, without the need for consent of the Holders, Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes:
(1) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes issued under the Indenture or discharge or defeasance thereof;
(2) upon release of a Notes Guarantee (with respect to the Liens securing such Notes Guarantee granted by such Guarantor);
(3) in connection with any disposition of Collateral to any Person (but excluding any transaction subject to "--Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation--The Company "); provided that if the Collateral is disposed of to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, the relevant Collateral becomes immediately subject to a substantially equivalent Lien in favor of the Security Agent securing the Notes; provided, further, that, in each case, such disposition is permitted by the Indenture;
(4) if the Company designates any Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property, assets and Capital Stock of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;
(5) in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain of our Secured Indebtedness as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement, or otherwise in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement;
168

(6) as may be permitted by the covenant described under "--Certain Covenants--Impairment of Security Interest"; and
(7) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance, transfer or other business combination conducted in compliance with the covenant described under "--Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation".
Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee.
Intercreditor Agreement
On the Issue Date, the Trustee shall accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other future Indebtedness that are secured by Collateral that also secures our obligations under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets. Any remaining proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral, after all obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other future Indebtedness have been repaid from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in repayment of all obligations under the Indenture and the Notes and any other indebtedness of the Company and the Guarantors permitted to be Incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements
The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Company, in connection with the Incurrence or refinancing by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness secured or permitted to be secured on the Collateral, the Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall enter into an intercreditor or similar agreement or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement (an "Additional Intercreditor Agreement ") with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or on terms that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company are not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to the application of the proceeds of the collateral held thereunder and the means of enforcement, it being understood that an increase in the amount of Indebtedness being subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not be deemed to be less favorable to the Holders and will be permitted by this covenant if the Incurrence of such Indebtedness and any Lien in its favor is permitted by the "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Indebtedness " and "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Liens" covenants; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. As used herein, the term "Intercreditor Agreement " shall include references to any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that supplements or replaces the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Indenture will provide that, at the written direction of the Company and without the consent of the Holders, the Trustee or the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (ii) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Company that is subject to any such agreement (provided that such Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the Indenture), (iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes Incurred in compliance with the Indenture), (v) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes Incurred in compliance with the Indenture or to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens or (vi) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Company shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding,
169

except as otherwise permitted below under "--Amendments and Waivers" or as permitted by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and the Company may only direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture relating to the Notes or any Intercreditor Agreement.
The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of any Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement as contemplated above.

The Proceeds Loan
On January 14, 2015 the Company, as lender, and Hurtigruten, as borrower, entered into the Proceeds Loan Agreement pursuant to which the Company loaned to Hurtigruten amounts used to repay the Former Financing Arrangements in connection with the Hurtigruten Acquisition.
After the Issue Date, the Proceeds Loan will bear interest at a rate equal to the interest rates of the Notes. Interest on the Proceeds Loan is payable semi-annually in arrears on or prior to the corresponding date for the payment of interest on the Notes.
The Proceeds Loan Agreement provides that Hurtigruten will pay the Company interest and principal due and payable on the Notes and any Additional Amounts due thereunder. All amounts payable under the Proceeds Loan will be payable to such account or accounts with such Person or Persons as the Company may designate. The maturity date of the Proceeds Loan will be at such times as will allow the Company to redeem, repay or repurchase the proportion of the Notes to be redeemed, repaid or repurchased by the Company, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, up to the principal amount of the Proceeds Loan. Except as otherwise required by law, all payments under the Proceeds Loan Agreement will be made without deductions or withholding for, or on account of, any applicable tax. In the event that Hurtigruten is required to make any such deduction or withholding, Hurtigruten shall gross up each payment to the Company to ensure that the Company receives and retains a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
The Proceeds Loan Agreement provides that Hurtigruten will make all payments pursuant thereto, up to the principal amount of the Proceeds Loan on a timely basis in order to ensure that the Company can satisfy its payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture, taking into account the administrative and timing requirements under the Indenture with respect to amounts payable on the Notes.
The Company's rights under the Proceeds Loan Agreement will be assigned by way of security to the Security Agent and comprise part of the Collateral, as described above under "--Security--The Collateral."

Optional Redemption
Except as set forth herein and under "--Redemption for Taxation Reasons," the Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Company.

At any time and from time to time on or after February 1, 2018, the Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at its option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice at a redemption price equal to the applicable percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

At any time and from time to time prior to February 1, 2018, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, the Company may redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional Notes) at a redemption price equal to (i) 107.50% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, with an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that:
(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 120 days after the closing of the related Equity Offering, and
(2) not less than 60% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes) remains outstanding immediately thereafter.
At any time prior to February 1, 2018, the Company may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes plus the relevant Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).
General
Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under "--Selection and Notice" below. If the Company effects an optional redemption of Notes of a series, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF of the LxSE, inform the LxSE of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of that series that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.
Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Company's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent (including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the consummation of such Equity Offering).
If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.
Sinking Fund
The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
Selection and Notice
If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the Registrar will select the Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, as certified to the Trustee by the Company, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear and/ or Clearstream, or if the Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear and/or Clearstream or Euroclear and/or Clearstream prescribes no method of selection, on a pro rata basis; provided, however, that no Note of 100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part. Neither the Trustee nor the Registrar shall be liable for selections made under this paragraph.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF of the LxSE and the rules of such exchange so require, the Company shall publish notice of redemption on the official website of the LxSE or in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) and in addition to such publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the
171

redemption date, mail such notice to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar; provided that, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, notices of redemption to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream (and such delivery will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph), each of which shall give notices to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests.
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption, unless the redemption price is not paid on the redemption date.
Redemption for Taxation Reasons
The Company or Successor Company (as defined herein) may redeem, and a Guarantor may cause the Company or Successor Company to redeem, the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption (a "Tax Redemption Date") (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (see "--Additional Amounts"), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if as a result of:
(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under "--Additional Amounts") affecting taxation; or
(2) any change in, or amendment to, the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including pursuant to a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a "Change in Tax Law");
the Company, Successor Company or Guarantor are, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Company, Successor Company or Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable and, in the case of a payment by a Guarantor, having the Company or another Guarantor make the payment, but not including assignment of the obligation to make payment with respect to the Notes). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change in Tax Law reflecting the proposals of the independent Tax Commission in their report, "Capital Taxation in an International Economy," published on December 2, 2014, "reasonable measures" shall be deemed to include, where it would be lawful to do so and would not subject the Company to any material unreimbursed cost, changing the domicile of the Company to, or having the obligations under the Notes assumed by an entity (that will hold, immediately after the assumption, all or substantially all of the Company's assets) domiciled in, a jurisdiction which does not, as of the date of the redomiciliation or assumption, impose withholding tax on payments under the Notes and, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, granting a first-ranking security interest over the shares of such entity to the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of this Offering Memorandum. In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (or, in the case of a Successor Company, on or after the date of assumption by the Successor Company of the Company's obligations hereunder). Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
172

"--Selection and Notice." Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor (as defined under "--Additional Amounts") would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Company, Successor Company or Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer's Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that it would not be able to avoid the obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Company, Successor Company or Guarantor has or have been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept such Officer's Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.
The foregoing of this "Redemption for Taxation Reasons" section will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Company, Successor Company or any Guarantor is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.
Additional Amounts
All payments made by or on behalf of the Company or a Successor Company under or with respect to the Notes, or any Guarantor (each of the Company, Successor Company and Guarantor, a "Payor") with respect to any Notes Guarantee, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:
(1) Norway or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having power to tax;
(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Notes Guarantee is made by the Company, Successor Company, Guarantor or their agents, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or
(3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clauses (1), (2) and (3), a "Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction"),
will at any time be required from any payments made with respect to any Note or Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the "Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holders or the Trustee, as the case may be, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:
(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, being a citizen or resident or national or domiciliary of, or the existence of a business, a permanent establishment, a dependent agent, a place of business or a place of management present or deemed present in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or Notes Guarantee, the enforcement of rights hereunder or under a Notes Guarantee or the receipt of any payment in respect thereof;
173

(2) any Taxes that are imposed, withheld or deducted by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or the beneficial owner, after reasonable notice, to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder or such beneficial owners or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirement relating to such matters, required by applicable law, regulation, treaty or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax; provided in each case the Holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so;
(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Notes Guarantee;
(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;
(5) any Taxes that are required to be imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to the Taxation Directive or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to the Taxation Directive;
(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;
(7) any Taxes which would not have been imposed if the Holder had presented the Note for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the Holder (except for Additional Amounts with respect to Taxes that would have been imposed had the Holder presented the Note for payment within such 30-day period);
(8) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment to a Holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or any Person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment or Note, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment or Note would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the actual Holder of such Note;
(9) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a Note pursuant to Sections 1471 to 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), any successor law or regulation implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Sections or any intergovernmental agreement or any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or
(10) any combination of the above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Company, and will provide such certified copies to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Registrar if the Notes are then listed on the Euro MTF of the LxSE. The Payor will attach to each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such withholding Taxes paid per 1,000 principal amount of the Notes.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any

payment made on any Note or Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will

deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the

amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts

to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises, or the Payor

becomes

aware

of

such

obligation,

less

174

than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer's Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate without further inquiry, as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes Guarantees or this "Description of the Notes" there are mentioned, in any context:
(1) the payment of principal;
(2) purchase or redemption prices in connection with a purchase or redemption of Notes;
(3) interest; or
(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or Notes Guarantee,
such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise, property or similar Taxes that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of any Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer or exchange of the Notes) excluding any such Taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction.
The foregoing obligations of this "Additional Amounts" section will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Company or any Guarantor is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.
Change of Control
If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or part (equal to 100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Company shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this "Change of Control" section in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described under "--Optional Redemption" or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.
Unless the Company has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described under "--Optional Redemption" or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Company will send a notice (the "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of any such Notes, by mail or otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee:
(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Company to purchase all or any part of such Holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the "Change of Control Payment");
(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent) (the "Change of Control Payment Date");
(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control;
(4) describing the procedures determined by the Company, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and
175

(5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered;
(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Company in the Change of Control Offer;
(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Company; and
(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Company.
If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee or an authentication agent appointed by the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the aggregate unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least 100,000 or an integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the LxSE and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF and the rules of such exchange so require, the Company will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of the Change of Control Offer as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort), or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the LxSE.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control; provided that the purchase date will be no earlier than 30 days from the date a notice of such Change of Control Offer is mailed.
The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder's right to require the Company to repurchase such Holder's Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Company or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.
The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.
The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and
176

regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.
A Change of Control will result in a mandatory prepayment under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Future debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries, including the Company, may prohibit the Company from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or may require repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Company.
Finally, the Company's ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Company's and the Company's then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See "Risk factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure--We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control."
The definition of "Change of Control" includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.
The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Company's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.

Certain Covenants
Limitation on Indebtedness
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, provided that the amount of Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this paragraph by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors shall not exceed 40.0 million.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers' acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate amount of Indebtedness then outstanding not exceeding (i) the greater of (x) 75.0 million and (y) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (ii) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making

Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6), (10) and (14) of the third paragraph of the

covenant described below under "--Limitation on Restricted Payments" to the extent the Company and its

Restricted

Subsidiaries

Incur

Indebtedness

in

179

reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (12) to the extent the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under the first paragraph and/or clauses (1), (6), (10) or (14) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below under "--Limitation on Restricted Payments" in reliance thereon; and
(13) Indebtedness Incurred by a Receivables Subsidiary in a Qualified Receivables Financing.
For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:
(i) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; provided that (i) Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant may not be reclassified and (ii) Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement incurred or outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided in clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant;
(ii) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of, letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;
(iii) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7) or (11) of the second paragraph or pursuant to the first paragraph, in each case, of this covenant, and the letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;
(iv) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;
(v) for the purposes of determining "Consolidated EBITDA" under clause (1)(i), (7) and (11) of the second paragraph of this covenant, (x) pro forma effect shall be given to Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (y) in relation to clause (1)(i) of the second paragraph of this covenant, Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured on the most recent date on which new commitments are obtained (in the case of revolving facilities) or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of term facilities) and for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to such date for which such internal consolidated financial statements of the Company are available;
(vi) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and
(vii) the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be calculated as described under the definition of "Indebtedness," provided that the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.
Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant.
If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date.
180

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Company, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the "Initial Lien"), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Notes Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured (provided that a Lien to secure Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) or (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "-- Limitation on Indebtedness" may have priority not materially less favorable to the Holders than that accorded to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date), and (b) in the case of any property or assets that constitute Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.
Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged (i) upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth under "Security--Release of Liens."
Limitation on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries
The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:
(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock to the Company or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company;
(B) make any loans or advances to the Company; or
(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company,
provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.
The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:
(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, (b) the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents or (c) any other agreement or instrument in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date, including, in each case, any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings, provided that the amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above, as applicable (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company);
(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on
186

which such Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;
(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an "Initial Agreement ") or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company);
(4) any encumbrance or restriction:
(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract;
(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements; or
(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;
(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property so acquired or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;
(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;
(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;
(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order (including encumbrances or restrictions on making distributions in cash or Cash Equivalents as a dividend or otherwise that arise or exist by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order) or encumbrances or restrictions required by any regulatory authority;
(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;
(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Agreements;
(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the
187

provisions of the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness " if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, together with the security documents associated therewith as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company) and where, in the case of clause (ii), the Company determines at the time such Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Company's ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes;
(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted by the covenant described under "--Limitation on Liens "; or
(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Receivables Financing.

Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition unless:
(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap); and
(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments.

Within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may apply an amount equal to such Net Available Cash at the option of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) (i) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph

of the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness," or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect

thereof; provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of

Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a) (except in the case of any revolving Indebtedness, including but not

limited to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire

such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to

the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed; or (ii) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem

Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu

Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or

redemption; provided that the Company shall redeem, repay, repurchase or redeem Pari Passu Indebtedness

that is Public Debt pursuant to this clause (ii) only if the Company makes (at such time or subsequently in

compliance with this covenant) an offer to the Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the

provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Notes at least

equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the

sum of the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount

outstanding of such Pari Passu Indebtedness; or (iii) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness

of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured on

assets

which

do

not

constitute

Collateral

(in

each

case,

188

other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary); or (iv) to purchase the Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repayment or purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);
(b) to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day;
(c) to make a capital expenditure pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company; provided, however, that any such capital expenditure made that is executed or approved within such time will only satisfy this requirement so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day; or
(d) any combination of the foregoing;
provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.
If an amount less than the Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions is applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested, or offered to be applied or invested, as provided in the preceding paragraph, an amount equal to the difference will be deemed to constitute "Excess Proceeds " under the Indenture. On the 366th day (or the 546th day, in the case of any Net Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or commitment approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of the second paragraph of this covenant) after the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier date that the Company elects, if the aggregate amount of "Excess Proceeds" under the Indenture exceeds 10.0 million, the Company will be required to make an offer (or procure an offer is made) ("Asset Disposition Offer ") to all Holders of Notes issued under the Indenture and, to the extent the Company so elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the "Excess Proceeds," at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes and 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable.
To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the "Excess Proceeds," the Company may use any remaining "Excess Proceeds" for general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of "Excess Proceeds," the "Excess Proceeds" shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis or by use of a pool factor on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, or by such other method in compliance with applicable legal, depositary and exchange requirements. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date
189

selected by the Company that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined herein). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of "Excess Proceeds" shall be reset at zero.
To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated that is actually received upon converting such portion of Net Available Cash into such currency.
The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the "Asset Disposition Offer Period "). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the "Asset Disposition Purchase Date"), the Company will purchase (or procure the purchase of) the aggregate principal amount of Notes and, to the extent they so elect, any Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the "Asset Disposition Offer Amount ") or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.
On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and, in the case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of 100,000 and in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver (or procure the mail or delivery) to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted for purchase, and the Company will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the Global Note), and the Trustee, upon delivery of an Officer's Certificate from the Company, will (via an authenticating agent) authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) such new Note to such Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of 100,000 or in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book-entry) by the Company to the Holder thereof.
For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:
(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;
(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;
(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;
(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and
(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with
190

all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed 4% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).
The Company will comply (or procure compliance), to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Company will comply (or procure compliance) with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.
Maintenance of Listing
The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the LxSE for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Company is unable to obtain admission to such listing or if at any time the Company determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain (where the Notes are initially so listed, prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the LxSE), and thereafter use its best efforts to maintain a listing of such Notes on another recognized stock exchange.
Limitation on Affiliate Transactions
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with or for the benefit of any Affiliate of the Company (such transaction or series of related transactions being an "Affiliate Transaction") involving aggregate value in excess of 3.0 million unless:
(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm's length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;
(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of 12.0 million, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above; and
(3) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate consideration in excess of 25.0 million, the Company has received a written opinion from an Independent Financial Advisor that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries or that the terms are not materially less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's length basis from a Person that is not an Affiliate.
The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:
(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under "--Limitation on Restricted Payments," any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under "--Limitation on Restricted Payments") or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in clauses (1)(b), (2), (11), (15) and (17) of the definition thereof);
(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee
191

benefits or consultants' plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case in the ordinary course of business;
(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;
(4) any transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or any Receivables Subsidiary;
(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);
(6) the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions, the Refinancing Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company and the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement in connection with any Public Offering;
(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement and the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of business;
(8) transactions with customers, clients, landlords, lessors and lessees of ships and suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, which, in each case, are in the ordinary course of business and are either fair to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;
(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;
(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of the Company or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company in their reasonable determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;
(11) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (12) hereof, (a) payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent) of annual management, consulting, monitoring or advisory fees and related expenses to an aggregate amount not to exceed 2.0 million in each twelve month period commencing on the Issue Date and (b) customary payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent) for financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities, including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which payments in respect of this clause (b) are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company in good faith;
(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all reasonable out of pocket expenses Incurred by such Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Company and its Subsidiaries; and

(13) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing.

Reports
For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will provide to the Trustee the following reports:
(1) within 120 days after the end of the Company's fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company or its predecessor as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Company or its predecessor for the two most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; provided that in the event of any change in the Company's fiscal year, the first annual report that is prepared in respect of such new fiscal year shall also include an unaudited consolidated balance sheet and an unaudited consolidated income statement and statement of cash flow of the Company as of and for the comparable prior period; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance sheet information of the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year; (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, EBITDA and liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (d) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; and (e) a description of material risk factors and material recent developments;

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or

financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods

presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a

change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as provided for below, no

report needs to include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Company. At the Company's

election it may also include financial statements of a Parent or of Hurtigruten in lieu of those for the Company;

provided that, if the financial statements of a Parent or of Hurtigruten are included in such report, a reasonably

detailed description of the material differences between the financial statements of the Parent or of Hurtigruten,

as

the

case

193

may be, and the Company shall be included for any such period. Following an Initial Public Offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity and/or the listing of such Capital Stock on a recognized stock exchange, the requirements of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange; provided that (x) the IPO Entity shall, in any case, provide financial statements consistent with the requirements of clause (2)(a) above for any applicable quarterly period pursuant to clause (2) above after the Issue Date and (y) to the extent such IPO Entity relies on such stock exchange reporting requirements to fulfill the requirements of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above, a reasonably detailed description of material differences between the financial statements of such IPO Entity and the financial statements of the Company shall be included for any period after the Issue Date.
At any time that any of the Company's Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Company, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise) together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the following items: operating revenue, EBITDA, profit/(loss), cash, total assets, total debt, shareholders equity, capital expenditures and interest expense.
Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports on such password protected website as may be then maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable public availability of such reports (as determined by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Notes.
The Company will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the LxSE and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF of the LxSE and the rules of such exchange so require, at the offices of the Registrar or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such reports on the official website of the LxSE.
In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Company shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.
Merger and Consolidation
The Company
The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless (and subject to the other terms of the Indenture):
(1) the Successor Company (if not the Company) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any Permissible Jurisdiction and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company, under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) to the extent required by applicable law to effect such assumption, all obligations of the Company under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and all rights and claims under any Proceeds Loan, subject in each case to any limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles;
(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a
194

result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be permitted to Incur at least an additional 1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness " or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Successor Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and
(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture, and that all conditions precedent therein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company and the Notes constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Successor Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (2) and (3) above.
Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness."
For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, which properties and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company, as the case may be.
The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the Indenture and the Notes but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.
Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant and the provisions described below under "--The Guarantors " (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Company and (b) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets to, an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Company, reincorporating the Company in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Company.
The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant) will not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the Company has complied with the covenant described under "-- Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock " or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company.
There is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person.
The Guarantors
No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:
195

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person, or
(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person, or
(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor,
unless:
(A) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor; or
(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes (a) all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee and (b), to the extent required by applicable law to effect such assumption, the obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which it is a party and, if applicable, any Proceeds Loan Agreement, in each case subject to any limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles; and
(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and is continuing; or
(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture.
Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B) and the provisions described under "--The Company" (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any Guarantor and (b) any Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Guarantor. Notwithstanding the preceding clause B(2) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), any Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such Guarantor, reincorporating such Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such Guarantor.
There is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person.

Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status
If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a "Suspension Event "), then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to such Notes: "--Limitation on Restricted Payments," "--Limitation on Indebtedness," "-- Limitation on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries," "--Limitation on Affiliate Transactions," "-- Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock," "--Additional Notes Guarantees and Collateral " and the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under "--Merger and Consolidation-- The Company," and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first

day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with

regard to actions of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the

Suspension Event, and the "--Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in

effect since the date of the Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a

Restricted

Payment

made

while

that

covenant

was

196

suspended. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at the Company's option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness" or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be Incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness," such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness." The Company shall notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of the covenants set forth above to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify Holders of such event.
Additional Notes Guarantees and Collateral
Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Company will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to Guarantee or otherwise become liable for any Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (or other Indebtedness that is Incurred under clause (1) or (6) of the second paragraph of "-- Limitation on Indebtedness"), any Public Debt and any Refinancing Indebtedness thereof or any other Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor exceeding 2.0 million in principal amount, in whole or in part unless, in each case, such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such other Guarantee or obligation is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture or other appropriate agreement pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the Indenture, which Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary's Guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided that if the Indebtedness Guaranteed by such other Guarantee is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or a Notes Guarantee, then such other Guarantee must be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary's Guarantee of the Notes to at least the same extent as such other Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or the Notes Guarantee, as the case may be.
A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee.
Following the provision of any additional Guarantees as described above, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (if such security is being granted in respect of the other Indebtedness), any such Guarantor will provide security over its material assets that are of the same type as any of the Company's or the Guarantors' assets that are required to be part of the Collateral as of the Issue Date or the Backstop Date, as applicable (excluding any assets of such Guarantor which are subject to a Permitted Lien at the time of the execution of such supplemental indenture if providing such security interest would not be permitted by the terms of such Permitted Lien or by the terms of any obligations secured by such Permitted Lien) to secure its Guarantee on a first priority basis consistent with the Collateral.
Each additional Guarantee or security will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs, the Company shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee the Notes or provide security to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee or the grant of such security would be inconsistent with the Intercreditor Agreement or the Agreed Security Principles.
197

Impairment of Security Interest
Silk Midco shall not, the Company shall not, and the Company shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action, which action or omission would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and Silk Midco shall not, and the Company shall not, and the Company shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any Lien over any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the covenant described under "--Limitation on Liens"; provided, that Silk Midco, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenant described under "--Limitation on Liens," including Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged or released in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any Lien in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
Subject to the foregoing, the Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated or otherwise modified or released to (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; or (iv) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that (except where permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or to effect or facilitate the creation of Permitted Collateral Liens for the benefit of the Security Agent and holders of other Indebtedness Incurred in accordance with the Indenture) no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated or otherwise modified or released, unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement or modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Company delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or investment bank which confirms the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or release, (2) a certificate from an Officer of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), or (3) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any qualifications customary for this type of opinion of counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Security Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, modified or released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or release and retake and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject. In the event that Silk Midco, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.

Further Assurances

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will, at their own

expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may

reasonably require (i) for registering any Security Documents in any required register and for perfecting or

protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security Documents and (ii) if such Security Documents

have become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such

Security Documents and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the

Security

Agent

or

in

any

receiver

of

all

198

or any part of those assets. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will execute all transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give all notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may reasonably request.
Limitations on Amendments to the Proceeds Loan
The Company will not, except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, (a) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest on any Proceeds Loan; (b) reduce the rate of interest on any Proceeds Loan; (c) change the currency for payment of any amount under any Proceeds Loan other than to euro or another currency in which Notes are denominated; (d) prepay or otherwise reduce or permit the prepayment or reduction of any Proceeds Loan (except to facilitate a payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes); (e) assign or novate any Proceeds Loan or any rights or obligations under any Proceeds Loan Agreement (other than to grant any Permitted Collateral Lien or in connection with a transaction that is subject to the covenant described under "--Merger and Consolidation" and is completed in compliance therewith); or (f) amend, modify or alter any Proceeds Loan or any Proceeds Loan Agreement and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement related to the Proceeds Loan in any manner materially adverse to the rights of the holders of the Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Proceeds Loan may be prepaid or reduced to facilitate or otherwise accommodate or reflect a repayment, redemption or repurchase of Indebtedness outstanding under the Notes and (ii) to the extent not having a materially adverse effect to holders of the Notes, the Proceeds Loan may be novated and/or assigned to any Guarantor or Successor Company.
Limitation on Company Activities
The Company will not engage in any business or undertake any other activity, own any material assets or incur any material liabilities other than: (a) ownership of the Capital Stock of Hurtigruten, debit and credit balances with its Restricted Subsidiaries and other credit and cash balances in bank accounts and Investments in Cash Equivalents, Temporary Cash Investments or Investment Grade Securities; (b) the provision of administration services and management services to its Subsidiaries of a type customarily provided by a holding company to its Subsidiaries and the ownership of assets necessary to provide such services; (c) the entry into and performance of its obligations (and incurrence of liabilities) under the Indenture, the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, any Hedging Obligations, other Indebtedness (including any Additional Notes), any Public Debt or any other obligations, in each case as otherwise permitted by the Indenture, any Security Document to which it is a party and the Intercreditor Agreement; (d) the making of any payments or other distributions in compliance with the covenant described under "--Limitation on Restricted Payments" and the making of any Permitted Investments; (e) reorganizations for bona fide corporate purposes in compliance with the covenant described under "--Merger and Consolidation"; provided that any successor entity resulting from any such reorganization is subject to this covenant; (f) the granting of security interests, indemnities and overhead costs or taxes and the entry into of any Security Document to which it is a party, the Intercreditor Agreement or any proceeds loans relating to the foregoing, in each case as otherwise permitted by the Indenture; (g) professional fees and administration costs in the ordinary course of business as a holding company; (h) related or reasonably incidental to the establishment or maintenance of its or its Subsidiaries' corporate existence; (i) any liabilities under any purchase agreement or any other document entered into in connection with the issuance of the Notes or any other Indebtedness as otherwise permitted under the Indenture; (j) pursuant to or in connection with the Hurtigruten Acquisition Transactions or the Refinancing Transactions, and under any management, advisory, monitoring or similar agreement, in each case as otherwise permitted by the Indenture; and (k) any other activities which are not specifically listed above and (x) which are ancillary to or related to those listed above or (y) which are de minimis in nature.
The Company will not undertake any transaction that will require the Company to register as an "investment company " as defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
199

Payments for Consent
The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to all Holders and is paid to all Holders that so consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes, to exclude Holders in any jurisdiction where (i) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an exchange offer or an offer to purchase for cash, or (ii) the payment of the consideration therefor would (A) require the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its member states), which the Company in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) would be materially burdensome; or (B) otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.
Events of Default
Each of the following is an "Event of Default " under the Indenture:
(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;
(2) default in any payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;
(3) failure to comply for 30 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any of the Company's obligations under the covenants described under "--Change of Control " above or the obligations of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the covenants described under "--Certain Covenants " above (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under clause (2) above);
(4) failure to comply by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with the Company's or the Guarantors' other agreements contained in the Indenture;
(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any Indebtedness for money borrowed by Silk Midco, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by Silk Midco, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:
(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness ("payment default "); or
(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "cross acceleration provision ");
and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the aggregate principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates 15.0 million or more;
(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Silk Midco, the Company or a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the "bankruptcy provisions");
200

(7) failure by the Company, a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of 15.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final and due (the "judgment default provision");
(8) any security interest under the Security Documents on any Collateral having a fair market value in excess of 15.0 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release or amendment of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or such Security Document or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable in a final non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or the Company shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days (the "security default provisions"); and
(9) any Notes Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture), or a Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Notes Guarantee in writing, other than in accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of the Notes Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture.
However, a default under clause (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) and (7) the Company does not cure such default (or arranges that such Default has been cured) within the time specified in clause (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) of this "Events of Default" section has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.
If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to (i) nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any and (ii) a covenant or provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holders of at least 90% of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, each of which may only be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least 90% of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or
201

powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:
(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;
(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and
(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.
Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.
The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and a responsible officer of the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 90 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (and within 14 days upon request at any time after the 120 days), an Officer's Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.
The Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its satisfaction in its sole discretion. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.
Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
Amendments and Waivers
Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
202

outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes). However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes), or if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend, waive or modify one series of the Notes, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes of such series amended, waived or modified, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes, held by a non-consenting Holder:
(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or modification;
(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;
(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;
(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under "--Optional Redemption" or "-- Redemption for Taxation Reasons";
(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;
(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder's Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder's Notes;
(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under "--Additional Amounts" that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;
(8) release all or substantially all the Guarantors from their obligations under their respective Notes Guarantees or the Indenture, except otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
(9) release the security interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the material Collateral, other than pursuant to the terms of the Security Document or the Indenture, as applicable, except as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
(10) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); or
(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders' consent described in this sentence.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:
(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;
(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company or the Guarantors under any Note Document;
(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the
203

Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 4701(b)(1)(B) of the Code) or change the minimum denominations for the Notes;
(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;
(5) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or does not adversely affect the rights of or benefits to the Trustee or any Holder in any material respect;
(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company) for the issuance of Additional Notes;
(7) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the covenant described under "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Indebtedness" and "--Certain Covenants-- Additional Notes Guarantees and Collateral" to add Notes Guarantees, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Notes Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;
(8) conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes Guarantees, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this Description of the Notes to the extent that such provision in this Description of the Notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, a Notes Guarantee, the Security Documents or the Notes;
(9) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Note Document; or
(10) in the case of the Security Documents, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of parties to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, in any property which is required by the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture and the covenant described under "--Certain Covenants--Impairment of Security Interest" is complied with.
The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer's Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.
The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder given in connection with a tender of such Holder's Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect the amendments authorized by clauses (2), (4) and (7) of the second paragraph of this covenant in respect of providing a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Company, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF of the LxSE and the rules of such exchange so require, the Company will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver on the official website of the LxSE or in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort).
Acts by Holders
In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, any Notes owned by the Company or by any Person
204

directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Company will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.
Defeasance
The Company at any time may terminate all its and each Guarantor's obligations under the Notes and the Indenture ("legal defeasance ") and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Company in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).
The Company at any time may terminate all its and each Guarantor's obligations under the covenants described under "--Certain Covenants" (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under "--Merger and Consolidation--The Company " and clauses (A), (B) and (C) of the covenant described under "--Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation--The Guarantors ") and "--Change of Control " and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under "--Events of Default" above, the operation of the cross default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions, the judgment default provision, the guarantee default provision and the security default provision described under "--Events of Default " above ("covenant defeasance ").
The Company at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of the covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under "--Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation--The Company "), (4), (5), (6) (other than with respect to the Company), (7), (8) or (9) under "--Events of Default " above.
In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the "defeasance trust ") with the Trustee (or such other entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euro, euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euro and euro-denominated European Government Obligations in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company, for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:
(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the Issue Date);
(2) an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company;
(3) an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;
(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and
(5) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.
205

Satisfaction and Discharge
The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Company) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company; (2) the Company has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose), cash in euro, euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euro and euro-denominated European Government Obligations in an amount sufficient, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company, to pay and discharge the outstanding aggregate principal amount of indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the funds deposited towards the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the "--Satisfaction and Discharge" section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders
No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company, any of the Company's Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company or the Guarantors under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents
U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such

terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in

principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the

Company and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest in its capacity as Trustee

that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain eligibility requirements or (c) becomes incapable of acting as

Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Company may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has

been

a

bona

fide

Holder

for

not

less

206

than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.
Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.
The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and expenses Incurred without negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

Notices
All notices to Holders will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, for so long as any of the Notes are listed on the LxSE and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF of the LxSE and the rules of the LxSE so require, notices with respect to the Notes listed on the Euro MTF will be published on the official website of the LxSE or in a leading newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the LxSE. For so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, each of which will give such notices to the holders of Book-Entry Interests.
Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail, cause to be delivered or otherwise transmit a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

Prescription
Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes or any Notes Guarantee will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

Currency Indemnity
The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Company and the Guarantors under or in connection with the Notes and the relevant Notes Guarantees, as the case may be, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Company, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Company or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Company or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any

Note, the Company and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the

Trustee as a result. In any event, the Company and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on

a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency

indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder or the Trustee to

certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Company (indicating the sources of information used) the loss

it

Incurred

in

making

any

such

207

purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Company's and the Guarantor's other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or to the Trustee.
Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a currency other than euro shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.
Enforceability of Judgments
Since substantially all the assets of the Company and the Guarantors are held or located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Company or any Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.
Consent to Jurisdiction and Service
In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, the Company and each Guarantor will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.
Governing Law
The Indenture and the Notes, including any Notes Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

TAXATION
If you are a prospective investor, you should consult your tax advisor as to the possible tax consequences of purchasing, holding or selling any Notes under the laws of your country of citizenship, residence or domicile, including the effect of any local taxes applicable to you. The discussions that follow do not purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or sell Notes. In particular, these discussions do not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to you. The discussions that follow for each jurisdiction are based upon the applicable laws and interpretations thereof as in effect as of the date of this offering memorandum. These tax laws and interpretations are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect.
Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Notes as of the date hereof. This summary deals only with Notes that are held as capital assets by a U.S. holder (as defined below) who acquires our Notes upon original issuance at their "issue price" (i.e. the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public for cash, excluding to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers).
As used herein, a "U.S. holder" means a person that is for United States federal income tax purposes any of the following:
· an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
· a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
· an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
· a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury Regulations ("Treasury Regulations") to be treated as a United States person.
This summary is based upon provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxes and does not address the effects of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or foreign, state, local or other tax considerations that may be relevant to U.S. holders in light of their particular circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address:
· tax consequences to holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, investors in partnerships or other pass-through entities for United States federal income tax purposes, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies;
· tax consequences to persons holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or conversion transaction or a straddle;
· tax consequences to U.S. holders whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar; or
· alternative minimum tax consequences, if any.
If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) holds our Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding our Notes, you should consult your tax advisors.
239

If you are considering the purchase of Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.
Payments of Interest
Subject to the discussion below, interest on a Note will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. In addition to interest on the Notes (which includes any foreign tax withheld from the interest payments you receive), you will be required to include in income any Additional Amounts paid in respect of such tax withheld. You may be entitled to deduct or credit this tax, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest income (including any Additional Amounts) on a Note generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the United States foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances.
If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the interest received, determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment of interest.
If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on:
· the last day of the accrual period,
· the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year, or
· the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period.
This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"). You should consult your own tax advisor as to the advisability of making the above election.
In addition, if you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note (including amounts received upon the sale of a Note attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), you will recognize ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment.
Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement and Other Taxable Disposition of Notes
Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid interest, which will be treated as interest income to the extent not previously included in income) and your tax basis in the Note. Your tax basis in a Note generally will be your U.S. dollar cost for that Note.
240

If you purchased your Note with foreign currency, your cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency paid for such Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase. If your Note is sold, exchanged, redeemed, retired or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for foreign currency, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency received on the date of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. If you are a cash method taxpayer and the Notes are traded on an established securities market, foreign currency paid or received will be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. An accrual method taxpayer may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.
Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, your gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, you have held the Note for more than one year. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, derived with respect to capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized by you on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note would generally be treated as United States source gain or loss.
Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates relating to the principal amount of such Note will be treated as exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be United States source gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price for the Note calculated in foreign currency on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date you purchased the Note. The amount of exchange gain or loss will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Note.
Exchange Gain or Loss with Respect to Foreign Currency
Your tax basis in any foreign currency received as interest on a Note or on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will be the U.S. dollar value thereof at the spot rate in effect on the date the foreign currency is received. Any gain or loss recognized by you on a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of the foreign currency will be ordinary income or loss and generally will be United States source gain or loss.
Reportable Transactions
Treasury Regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS including, in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note, or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note to the extent that such sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. Holders considering the purchase of Notes should consult with their own tax advisor to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
Generally, information reporting requirements will apply to all payments of principal and interest on a Note, or the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of a Note, unless you are an exempt recipient. Additionally, if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number, or in the case of interest payments fail either to report in full dividend and interest income or to make certain certifications, you may be subject to backup withholding.
241

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. You are urged to consult your own tax advisors regarding backup withholding and information reporting requirements relating to your ownership and disposition of the Notes.
United States Return Disclosure Requirements for Individual U.S. Holders
Certain U.S. holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions), by attaching a complete IRS Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, with their tax return for each year in which they hold an interest in the Notes. You are urged to consult your own tax advisors regarding information reporting requirements relating to your ownership of the Notes.
EU Directive on the Taxation of Savings Income
EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the "Savings Directive") requires EU Member States to provide to the tax authorities of other EU Member States details of payments of interest and other similar income paid by a person established within its jurisdiction to (or for the benefit of) an individual resident, or certain other types of entity established, in that other EU Member State, except that Austria will instead impose a withholding system in relation to such payments, deducting tax at a rate of 35% for a transitional period (subject to a procedure whereby, on meeting certain conditions, the beneficial owner of the interest or other income may request that no tax be withheld) unless during such period it elects otherwise.
The Council of the European Union has adopted a Directive (the "Amending Directive") which will, when implemented, amend and broaden the scope of the requirements of the Savings Directive described above. The Amending Directive will expand the range of payments covered by the Savings Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities, and the circumstances in which payments must be reported or paid subject to withholding. For example, payments made to (or for the benefit of) (i) an entity or legal arrangement effectively managed in an EU Member State that is not subject to effective taxation, or (ii) a person, entity or legal arrangement established or effectively managed outside of the EU (and outside any third country or territory that has adopted similar measures to the Savings Directive) which indirectly benefit an individual resident in an EU Member State, may fall within the scope of the Savings Directive, as amended. The Amending Directive requires EU Member States to adopt national legislation necessary to comply with it by January 1, 2016, which legislation must apply from January 1, 2017. Investors who are in any doubt as to their position should consult their professional advisers.
The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax ("FTT")
On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's Proposal") for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "participating Member States").
The Commission's Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.
Under the Commission's Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.
A joint statement issued in May 2014 by the participating Member States (other than Slovenia) indicated an intention to implement the FTT progressively, such that it would initially apply to transactions involving shares and certain derivatives, with this initial implementation occurring by January 1, 2016. However, full details are not available. The FTT, as initially implemented on this basis, may not apply to dealings in the Notes.
242

The proposed FTT remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States and the timing remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.
Certain United Kingdom Taxation Considerations
The comments below are of a general nature based on current United Kingdom tax law as applied in England and Wales and HM Revenue & Customs ("HMRC") practice (which may not be binding on HMRC), which may be subject to change, sometimes with retrospective effect, and are not intended to be exhaustive. They assume that there will be no further issues of securities that will form a single series with the Notes, and do not address the consequences of any such further issue (notwithstanding that such further issue may be permitted by the terms and conditions of the Notes). They assume that neither interest on the Notes nor payments in respect of the Notes Guarantees have or will have a United Kingdom source and, in particular, that neither the Company nor any successor company nor the Guarantors are or will be United Kingdom resident or act or will act through a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom in relation to the Notes. They do not necessarily apply where the income is deemed for tax purposes to be the income of any other person. They relate only to the position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of their Notes and any interest payable on their Notes. In particular, they only relate to persons holding the Notes as an investment. Certain classes of persons such as dealers, certain professional investors, or persons connected with the Company may be subject to special rules and this summary does not apply to such Noteholders.
This summary is a general guide for information purposes and should be treated with appropriate caution. It does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all the potential United Kingdom tax consequences of acquiring, holding or disposing of the Notes and is not intended to be, nor should it be considered legal or tax advice.
Any holders of Notes who are in doubt as to their own tax position, or who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, should consult their professional advisers.
Withholding or Deduction of Tax on Payments of Interest by the Company or under the Notes Guarantees
Payments of Interest by the Company
Payments of interest on the Notes by the Company may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax.
Payments under the Notes Guarantees
Any payments in respect of the Notes Guarantees may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax.
Exchange of Information
HMRC has powers to obtain information relating to securities in certain circumstances. This may include details of the beneficial owners of the Notes (or the persons for whom the Notes are held), details of the persons to whom payments derived from the Notes are or may be paid and information and documents in connection with transactions relating to the Notes. Information may be required to be provided by, amongst others, the holders of the Notes, persons by (or via) whom payments derived from the Notes are made or who receive (or would be entitled to receive) such payments, persons who effect or are a party to transactions relating to the Notes on behalf of others and certain registrars or administrators. In certain circumstances, the information obtained by HMRC may be exchanged with tax authorities in other countries.
Taxation of Disposal (Including Redemption) and Return (Including Interest)
Holders of Notes Subject to Corporation Tax
Holders of the Notes within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax (including non-resident Noteholders whose Notes are used, held or acquired for the purposes of a trade carried on in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment) will be subject to United Kingdom tax as income
243

on all profits and gains from the Notes broadly in accordance with their statutory accounting treatment. Such holders of the Notes will generally be charged in each accounting period by reference to interest and other amounts which, in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice, are recognized in determining the Noteholder's profit or loss for that period. Fluctuations in value relating to foreign exchange gains and losses in respect of the Notes will generally be brought into account as income.
Other Holders of Notes
Taxation of Interest
Holders of the Notes within the charge to United Kingdom income tax (including holders of the Notes who are either individuals or trustees and are resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or who carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable) will generally be liable to United Kingdom tax on the amount of any interest received in respect of the Notes.
Taxation of Disposal
Dependent, among other things, on the discount (if any) at which the Notes are issued and the premium which is or may be payable upon redemption, the Notes may be deemed to constitute "deeply discounted securities" for the purposes of Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005. If the Notes are so categorized, any profit made on a disposal (including redemption) of a Note by an individual or trustee (i) who is resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or (ii) who is subject to United Kingdom income tax by virtue of carrying on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable, will be taxed as income. In calculating any gain or loss on disposal of a Note, sterling values may be compared at acquisition and transfer. Accordingly, a taxable profit may arise even where the foreign currency amount received on a disposal is less than or the same as the amount paid for the Note.
If the Notes are not deemed to constitute deeply discounted securities, (i) if the Notes are "qualifying corporate bonds" within the meaning of Section 117 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 ("Qualifying Corporate Bonds"), on a disposal of the Notes neither chargeable gains nor allowable losses should arise for the purposes of taxation of capital gains, however (ii) if the Notes are not Qualifying Corporate Bonds, a disposal of a Note by a holder of the Note who is either an individual or a trustee and who is resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or who carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Note is attributable may give rise to a chargeable gain or allowable loss for the purposes of taxation of capital gains. In calculating any gain or loss on disposal of a Note, sterling values are compared at acquisition and transfer. Accordingly, a taxable profit can arise even where the foreign currency amount received on a disposal is less than or the same as the amount paid for the Note. A transfer (within the meaning of Chapter 2 of Part 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (Accrued Income Profits and Losses)) of a Note by a Noteholder who is either an individual or a trustee and who is resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or who carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Note is attributable may however give rise to a charge to tax on income in respect of an amount representing interest on the Note which has accrued since the preceding interest payment date under the provisions of Chapter 2 of Part 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (Accrued Income Profits and Losses).
Taxation of Premium on Early Redemption
It is possible that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity at a premium (including at the option of the Company). Payment of such premium may constitute a payment of interest. Payments of interest are subject to UK withholding tax and reporting requirements as outlined above.
HOLDERS OF NOTES ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN PROFESSIONAL ADVISERS IF THEY REQUIRE ANY ADVICE OR FURTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO DEEPLY DISCOUNTED SECURITIES.
Certain Norwegian Taxation Considerations
The following section is a summary of certain Norwegian tax consequences resulting from the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion does not purport to be a
244

comprehensive description of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the Notes. In particular, this discussion does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser subject to special tax regimes, such as banks, insurance companies or tax-exempt organizations. The following summary is based on the laws currently in force and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum in the Kingdom of Norway which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.
PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF THE NOTES ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ANY STATE OR LOCAL TAXES UNDER THE TAX LAWS AND TAX TREATIES APPLICABLE IN THE KINGDOM OF NORWAY AND EACH COUNTRY OF WHICH THEY ARE RESIDENTS OR WHOSE TAX LAWS APPLY TO THEM FOR OTHER REASONS.
Please note that for the purpose of the summary below, a reference to a Norwegian or Non-Norwegian holder of Notes refers to the tax residency, and not the nationality, of the holder of the Notes.
Taxation of interest
Norwegian holders of Notes
Both corporate and individual holders of Notes who are residents of Norway are subject to Norwegian tax on interest received with a flat tax rate, currently at 27%. Interest income is taxable on an accrual basis, so that all interest paid or accrued during the income year is taxable. Where a Note is sold during the income year, the seller will be taxed for any unpaid accrued interest prior to the date of sale, and the buyer will be taxed for interest accrued from the date of acquisition of such Note.
When calculating the taxable interest income, interest in foreign currency under the Notes is calculated in Norwegian kroner based on the exchange rate at the date of payment, or at the exchange rate as of December 31 for interest that is accrued but not paid during the income year.
Non-Norwegian holders of Notes
In general, payments of interest on Notes issued to holders of Notes who are not resident in Norway for tax purposes are, under present Norwegian law, not subject to Norwegian tax. Payments to Non-Norwegian holders of Notes may therefore be made without any withholding tax or deduction for any Norwegian taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges.
However, if the Notes are held by an individual or by a company not resident in Norway but that carries out a business activity that is taxable in Norway, and the Notes are effectively connected with such business, interest received will be taxed in Norway with a tax rate of 27%, calculated as described above for Norwegian holders of Notes and assessed as part of the total taxable income of such business.
If Notes are held by a partnership, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner of a partnership that holds Notes should consult its tax advisor.
Taxation of capital gains or losses on disposal of Notes
Norwegian holders of Notes
Capital gains realized by Norwegian holders of Notes upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable realization of a Note will be subject to Norwegian taxation at the rate of 27%. Losses will be tax deductible.
The taxable gain/deductible loss is calculated per Note and is equal to the sales price less the Norwegian holders of Notes' cost price of the Note, including costs incurred in relation to the acquisition or realization of the Note. Any amount of unpaid interest accrued at the time of a transfer of a Note is subtracted from the sales price, reducing the seller's taxable gain/increasing the seller's deductible loss, provided that the unpaid interest accrued is taxed as interest for the seller. The buyer's cost price is reduced correspondingly.
245

Any gain received or loss incurred in foreign currency when realizing Notes shall be calculated in Norwegian kroner based on the exchange rate at the date of realization when calculating the taxable gain. The cost price shall be calculated in Norwegian kroner based on the exchange rate at the time of acquisition of the Notes, whereas the sales price is calculated in Norwegian kroner based on the exchange rate at the time of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable realization.
Non-Norwegian holders of Notes Capital gains or profits realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other realization of Notes by nonNorwegian holders of Notes are not subject to Norwegian taxes or duties. However, if the Notes are held by an individual or by a company not resident in Norway but that carries out a business activity that is taxable in Norway, and the Notes are effectively connected with such business, gains will be taxed, and losses will be deductible, in Norway with a tax rate of 27%, calculated as described above for Norwegian holders of Notes and assessed as part of the total taxable income of such business. If Notes are held by a partnership, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner of a partnership that holds Notes should consult its tax advisor. Net wealth tax Corporate holders of Notes who are resident of Norway are not subject to Norwegian net wealth tax. Individual holders of Notes who are residents of Norway are subject to net wealth tax, taxable on an annual basis. The taxable value of a Note is the listed price on December 31 of the income year, calculated in Norwegian kroner, based on the exchange rate as of the same date, and is included in the basis for the computation of net wealth tax imposed on Norwegian individual Note holders. The marginal net wealth tax rate is 0.85% of the value assessed. Non-resident holders of Notes are not liable to pay net wealth tax in Norway on the holding of Notes, unless the holder is an individual carrying out a business activity that is taxable in Norway and the Notes are effectively connected with such business.

CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY
Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests relating to the Notes, and of certain insolvency law considerations in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company, the Guarantors and the providers of security (as of the date hereof) are organized or incorporated. It is a summary only. Bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or a similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and/or in the jurisdiction of organization or incorporation of a future guarantor under the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction's law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and any security securing the Notes.
European Union
The Company and the Guarantors are organized or incorporated under the laws of EU Member States. Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the "EU Insolvency Regulation"), the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its "center of main interest" (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its "center of main interest" is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.
The term "center of main interest" is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its "center of main interests" in the EU Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the "center of main interests" of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and "is therefore ascertainable by third parties." In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the perception of the company's creditors as regards to the center of the company's business operations may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its "center of main interests."
If the "center of main interest" of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation with these proceedings being governed by the lex fori concursus (the local laws of the court opening such main insolvency proceedings). Insolvency proceedings opened in one EU Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized automatically in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark). If the "center of main interests" of a debtor is in one EU Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open "territorial proceedings" only in the event that such debtor has an "establishment" in the territory of such other EU Member State. If the main insolvency proceedings have been opened by the court of the EU Member State where the center of main interest of the debtor is situated, and are outstanding, then the territorial proceedings (entitled "secondary" proceedings) can only be winding-up proceedings. If no such main insolvency proceedings are outstanding, the territorial proceedings could still be opened in another EU Member State (except Denmark) under certain circumstances as set forth in Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other EU Member State. If the company does not have an establishment in any other EU Member State, no court of any other EU Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation.
In the event that any one or more of the Company, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Company and the Guarantors.
247

Norway
Financial assistance
Pursuant to Section 8-7 of the Norwegian Private Limited Companies Act of 1997 No. 44 (Aksjeloven) and the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act of 1997 No. 45 (Allmennaksjeloven) (together, the "Acts" and each an "Act") a Norwegian private or public limited liability company is prohibited from providing financial assistance (including placing funds at disposal, granting loans or providing security or guarantees) to physical shareholders, shareholders outside the group of companies that the relevant company belongs to or shareholders that do not have a controlling interest in the company, (other than assistance on ordinary commercial terms in connection with commercial contracts of the Group (kreditt med vanlig løpetid i forbindelse med forretningsavtaler) unless the value of such financial assistance is within the company's distributable reserves, satisfactory security for repayment of such financial assistance has been established and the financial assistance is provided on ordinary business terms and principles and for fully paid shares.
Pursuant to Section 8-10 of the Acts, a Norwegian private or public limited liability company is prohibited from providing financial assistance (including placing funds at disposal, granting loans or providing security or guarantees) in connection with the acquisition of its shares or in connection with the acquisition of shares in a parent company (including any intermediate parent company) unless the value of such financial assistance is within the company's distributable reserves, satisfactory security for repayment of such financial assistance has been established and the financial assistance is provided on ordinary business terms and principles and for fully paid shares.
The practical restriction in respect of financial assistance referred to above applies irrespective of whether such parent company is a Norwegian or a foreign company, and there are no general exemptions available except for special cases of real property financing and employee share purchase programs.
The restriction applies not only to the granting of loans, guarantees and security, but also to making assets available and other transfers that are not lawful distributions in accordance with the Acts. The assistance is restricted if made "in connection with the acquisition of shares," which may also cover financial assistance after completion of the acquisition (such as the refinancing of an acquisition loan facility or the subsequent merger of the target company and the acquiring entity).
This means that in practice a Norwegian guarantor cannot guarantee or provide security for any loans or notes, which have been used to finance the acquisition of the shares of that guarantor or a parent company (including any intermediate parent company) or the Norwegian guarantor.
As a consequence of the above restrictions, the value of a Notes Guarantee and any security provided by a Norwegian guarantor may be reduced to zero to the extent it secures obligations relating to the acquisition of shares in itself or its parent company. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor's obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. The Notes Guarantees of the Notes to be granted by Guarantors organized under the laws of Norway will be limited by financial assistance, among other limitations, which may substantially limit their value. The Notes Guarantees given by the Guarantors organized under the laws of Norway will be limited to the principal amount of the Notes less an amount of 133.7 million, reflecting the Notes proceeds which will be used to refinance acquisition debt drawn under the Bridge Facility in order to finance the Hurtigruten Acquisition. In addition, a Notes Guarantee or security interest infringing on the limitations set forth in Section 8-10 of the Acts will be void, and any funds paid out will have to be repaid. Finally, an illegal arrangement of this kind may give rise to directors' liability issues.
The Notes Guarantees and the security interests provided by Norwegian companies the Security Documents will be subject to the limitation language set forth in the Indenture.
Creation and Enforcement of Security
Norwegian law provides for effectively creating security over a range of closely defined asset types (a floating charge may be established over certain types of assets owned by a Norwegian company).
248

As a main rule, a secured creditor does not have a general step-in right to security assets in an enforcement situation and agreements on enforcement cannot validly be entered into prior to the occurrence of an event of default. Instead, enforcement must be sought through the Norwegian courts or the Norwegian enforcement authorities. However, this is different for shares in a Norwegian limited company. If the secured party is a financial institution, the shares are considered financial collateral, and the parties are free (within reasonable limits) to agree on the enforcement process in the share pledge agreement.
Also, for specific security assets, and under certain circumstances, a creditor may take possession or directly enforce its rights upon enforcement. This is the case for security established over receivables (such as trade receivables or bank account claims) whereby the secured party may instruct the relevant debtor to pay the outstanding amounts directly to the secured party instead of the chargor.
The concept of a security trustee, as it is understood under U.S. law, does not exist under Norwegian law. In Norway a security trustee would be considered to be acting as a security agent. In practice in Norway, in an arrangement with a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties, as these exist from time to time, it is generally recognized under Norwegian law that the security agent will be able to enforce the security on behalf of the secured parties and apply any proceeds to the secured parties. In order to commence any legal action regarding a claim (for enforcement purposes or otherwise) against the debtor the security agent may be required to disclose to the court the identity of the creditors and have the creditors join in or participate as claimants in the proceedings. It has been established by the Norwegian Supreme Court that a bond trustee for an undisclosed number of noteholders can, based on the provisions in the relevant bond agreement or indenture, take legal action against the issuer on behalf of and in lieu of the noteholders without having to disclose the identity of the noteholders. However, the relevant Norwegian court would have to examine the relevant indenture together with the other relevant agreements relating to the Notes and this Offering to determine whether the trustee would be able to act in such capacity.

Insolvency
Norwegian insolvency legislation is regulated by the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act of June 8, 1984 No. 58 (Konkursloven) the "Bankruptcy Act"), which sets forth the various procedures to be followed both in the case of court-administered debt negotiations and bankruptcy proceedings, and the Creditors Recovery Act of June 8, 1984 No. 59 (Dekningsloven) (the "Recovery Act") containing provisions on, among other things, the priority of claims.

The key features of the Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are (i) the seizure and subsequent disposal of the debtor's assets, (ii) the assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) the testing and revocation of transactions (including the securing of existing claims) made prior to bankruptcy, (iv) the handling of the debtor's contractual relationships and (v) the distribution of funds (if any) in accordance with the priority rules. If the business operations of the bankrupt company are continued, they are in practice continued at the risk of, and only to the extent guaranteed by, the creditors.

Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened provided that the debtor is insolvent. Both the debtor and the creditors (holding or alleging to hold a claim) can petition for bankruptcy.

There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent: (i) the debtor must be unable to service its debts as they becomes due (the "liquidity test") and (ii) the debtor's debts must exceed the sum of its assets and revenue, based on real, not book, values (the "balance sheet test").

During bankruptcy proceedings the debtor's assets are controlled by the court-appointed liquidator (usually a lawyer), on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. The main task of the liquidator is to turn all the debtor's assets into cash in the manner assumed to be most profitable for the estate (the creditors), and then distribute the available cash to the rightful creditors.

In the case of bankruptcy, all of the debtor's assets will be seized by the bankruptcy estate, and the debtor

may not dispose of the seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The bankruptcy

estate may also seize assets held by third parties, if these assets are acquired from the debtor in an unlawful

manner,

if

the

acquisition

lacks

legal

protection,

or

if

the

249

transaction can be reversed according to the Recovery Act. The bankruptcy estate is a separate legal entity, which is authorized to exercise all ownership interests and rights with respect to the seized assets, including but not limited to the realization of assets.
Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value of the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured creditors may, in principle, realize the security, and cover their claims; however, the realization of a number of categories of security during the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy estate (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate has the right, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, to realize the security and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and other creditors holding legal rights in the assets.
Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien on up to 5% of the estimated value or sales value of all assets secured by the debtor for its own debt or by a third-party for the debtor's indebtedness, but limited to NOK 602,000 (which is 700 times the ordinary Norwegian court fee of NOK 860). Such statutory lien is not applicable to financial security (cash deposits and financial instruments) established pursuant to the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act no. 17/2004 (the "Financial Collateral Act") or the Norwegian Liens Act no. 2/1980 section 6-4 (9).
Any under-secured amount (any amount of debt exceeding the value of the assets securing it) will be deemed to be an ordinary (unsecured) trade claim.
In a Norwegian bankruptcy, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority:
· secured claims (valid and perfected security covered up to the value of the secured asset, either after the realization by the secured creditor itself or after realization undertaken by the bankruptcy estate);
· super priority claims (claims that arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidator's costs and obligations of the estate);
· salary claims (within certain limitations);
· tax claims (such as withholding tax and value-added tax within certain limitations);
· ordinary unsecured claims (all other claims unless subordinated, including unsecured debt, trade creditor claims and indemnity claims); and
· subordinated claims (including interest incurred after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, claims subordinated by agreement, liquidated damages and penalty claims).
Pursuant to the Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions carried out in the three to twelve-month period (and, in respect of transactions in favor of related parties, up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy, such as extraordinary payments of certain creditors, security established for existing debt and transactions at an under-value. The bankruptcy estate may also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently which in an improper manner increase the debtor's debt, favor one or more creditors at the expense of others or deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors' claims, in which case the time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to ten years.
Solvent Enforcement
Enforcement of security normally requires that the pledgee or chargee files an application to the enforcement authorities for the enforcement of the security. Certain types of security may, however, be enforced without the involvement of the enforcement authority or a court, typically security established pursuant to the Financial Collateral Act and charges over monetary claims. A provision granting the secured party such right of enforcement is typically included in any security agreement between the pledgor/chargor and the secured party.
Enforcement of a guarantee claim against a solvent guarantor will in principal require a final, legally binding judgment by a court (unless the guarantee is made as an enforceable promissory note). Thereafter the creditor may apply to the enforcement authorities for enforcement of his or her claim.

BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM
General
On the Issue Date, the Notes will be deposited with, and registered in the name of, the nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear Bank SA/NV ("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme ("Clearstream"). The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by one global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "144A Global Notes"). The Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S will initially be represented by one global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "Regulation S Global Notes"). The 144A Global Notes together with the Regulation S Global Notes will be referred to herein as the "Global Notes."
After the closing date, book-entry interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and/or Clearstream or their respective participants. Ownership of interests in the Global Notes ("book-entry interests", and each a "book-entry interest") will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through those participants. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of book-entry interests will not be considered the owners or "holders" of Notes for any purpose.
So long as the Notes are held in global form, the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will be considered the sole holder of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture governing the Notes. Accordingly, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of the participants through which they own book-entry interests, to transfer the interests or in order to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture governing the Notes.
Neither we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, nor the Registrar, the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream nor any of our or their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the book-entry interests.
Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes
The book-entry interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear or Clearstream will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant's account with the interest beneficially owned by that participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including some states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge book-entry interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, "holders" of book-entry interests will not be considered the owners or "holders" of Notes for any purpose.
Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, to the extent permitted by Euroclear or Clearstream, owners of book-entry interests will receive definitive Notes in registered form ("Definitive Registered Notes"):
· if Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act and we do not appoint a successor within 90 days; or
· if the owner of a book-entry interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.
In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, in each case as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of the book-entry interests). Those Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend described under "Transfer Restrictions" unless that legend is not required at the time by the Indenture governing the Notes or applicable law.
251

Redemption of Global Notes In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their
respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the book-entry interests in that Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of the Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of the book-entry interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of the Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants' accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on any other basis that they deem fair and appropriate (including the pool factor); provided, however, that no book-entry interest of less than 100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.
Payments on Global Notes Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes will be made by us in euro to the Paying
Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn, make payments to Euroclear or Clearstream which will distribute those payments to participants in accordance with its procedures. Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, we and the Trustee will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes as the owner of the Notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we nor the Trustee nor any of our or its agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:
· any aspect of the records of (or maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of) Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a book-entry interest;
· any other matter relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participants or indirect participants; or
· the common depositary, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.
Payments by participants to owners of book-entry interests held through participants are the responsibility of those participants, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in "street name."
To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Notes as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Company, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.
We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the book-entry interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.
Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
Noteholder only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the book-entry interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes for which the participant or participants has or have given direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the relevant Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute those Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.
252

Transfers The Global Notes will bear a legend as described under "Transfer Restrictions." Book-entry interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to restrictions on transfer described under "Transfer Restrictions."
Book-entry interests in the Rule 144A Global Note ("restricted book-entry interests") may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of book-entry interests in the Regulation S Global Note ("unrestricted book-entry interests") only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture governing the Notes) to the effect that the transfer is made in accordance with Regulation S and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction.
Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, any sale or transfer of interests to U.S. persons will not be permitted unless the resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A.
Unrestricted book-entry interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of restricted book-entry interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture governing the Notes) to the effect that the transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction.
Any book-entry interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a book-entry interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a book-entry interest in the former Global Note and become a book-entry interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all Transfers, if any, and other procedures applicable to book-entry interest in that other Global Note for as long as that person retains the book-entry interest.
Definitive Registered Notes, if any, may be transferred and exchanged for book-entry interests in a Global Note only pursuant to the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture governing the Notes) to the effect that the transfer will comply with the appropriate Transfers applicable to those Notes.
Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System Initial Settlement
Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-entry interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-entry interests will be credited to the securities custody account of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.
Secondary Market Trading The book-entry interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the sale determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any book-entry interests where both the purchasers' and seller's accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.
Trustee's Powers In considering the interests of the holders of Notes, while title to the Notes is registered in the name of a
nominee of a clearing system, the Trustee may have regard to, and rely on, any information provided to it by that clearing system as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its accountholders with entitlements to Notes and may consider such interests as if such accountholders were the holders of the Notes.
253

Enforcement For the purposes of enforcement of the provisions of the Indenture against the Trustee, the persons named in
a certificate of the holder of the Notes in respect of which a Global Note is issued shall be recognized as the beneficiaries of the trust set out in the Indenture to the extent of the principal amounts of their interests in the Notes set out in the certificate of the holder, as if they were themselves the Noteholders in such principal amounts. Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream
We understand the following with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: · Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in accounts of those participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. · Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.
254

TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS
The following restrictions will apply to the Notes. You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of the Notes. See "Description of the Notes."
None of the Notes have been registered under the U.S. Securities Act, and they may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Accordingly, the Notes are being offered and sold only (A) to qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A and (B) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S. A non-U.S. person shall include any dealer or other professional fiduciary in the United States which is acting on a discretionary basis for non-U.S. beneficial owners (other than an estate or trust) in reliance upon Regulation S. As used in this section, the terms "United States" and "U.S. person" have the meanings given to them in Regulation S.
Each purchaser of Notes will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented and agreed with us, the Initial Purchaser as follows:
1. It is purchasing the Notes for its own account or for an account with respect to which it exercises sole investment discretion and that it and any such account is either (A) a qualified institutional buyer, and is aware that the sale to it is being made in reliance on Rule 144A or (B) at the time the buy order for the Notes is originated, a non-U.S. person that is outside the United States (or a non-U.S. person that is a dealer or other fiduciary as referred to above).
2. It acknowledges that the Notes are being offered for resale in a transaction not involving a public offering in the United States (within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act) and have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any other securities laws and may not be reoffered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except as set forth below.
3. It shall not offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer the Notes except (A) to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (B) inside the United States to a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction complying with Rule 144A or (C) outside the United States in an offshore transaction in compliance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. It acknowledges that the exemption provided by Rule 144 for resale of the Notes is not available.
4. It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions on transfer of such Notes.
5. It is relying on the information contained in this offering memorandum in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes. It acknowledges that neither we nor the Initial Purchaser have made any representation to it with respect to us or the offering or sale of any Notes, other than the information contained in this offering memorandum which has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes. It has had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of and request information from us and the Initial Purchaser.
6. It acknowledges that prior to any proposed transfer of Notes in certificated form or of beneficial interests in a Global Note (in each case other than pursuant to an effective registration statement), the Noteholder or the holder of beneficial interests in a Global Note, as the case may be, may be required to provide certifications and other documentation relating to the manner of such transfer and submit such certifications and other documentation as provided in the Indenture governing the Notes.
7. It understands that all of the Notes will bear a legend to the following effect unless otherwise agreed by us and the holder thereof:
THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "U.S. SECURITIES ACT"), OR SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTION AND, ACCORDINGLY, NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE REOFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OR TO, OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OR BENEFIT OF, U.S. PERSONS IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") to be dated as of the date of this offering memorandum, the Company has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchaser, and the Initial Purchaser has agreed to purchase the Notes from the Company. The Initial Purchaser is Goldman Sachs International.
The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchaser to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to customary closing conditions.
During the period from the date of this offering memorandum through and including the date that is 90 days thereafter, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries or other controlled affiliates will, without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchaser, offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise dispose of any debt securities, issued or guaranteed by any of the Company or the Guarantors and having a tenor of more than one year (other than the Notes and the Notes Guarantees).
The Initial Purchaser proposes to offer the Notes initially at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum and may include selling group members who might be granted a selling concession. After the initial Offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be changed by the Initial Purchaser without notice. The Initial Purchaser may make offers and sales in the United States through its U.S. broker dealer affiliates.
The Purchase Agreement provides that we have agreed, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchaser against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that they may be required to make in that respect.
The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given them by Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Resale of the Notes is restricted as described under "Transfer Restrictions." Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under "Transfer Restrictions."
In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, an offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a broker dealer (whether or not it is participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act.
Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchaser may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price of the Notes set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum.
No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, by any of the Company, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchaser that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to the Company, the Guarantors or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of Notes. See "Transfer Restrictions."
The Company and each Guarantor have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.
257

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Company will make an application to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes for trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange's Euro MTF market. However, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be admitted to trading or that such admission to trading will be maintained. The Initial Purchaser has advised us that it intends to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchaser is not obliged, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the Initial Purchaser's sole discretion without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, or that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you.
The Initial Purchaser may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act.
Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the relevant Offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchaser to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.
These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.
The Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that:
· it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the "FSMA")) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Company or any Guarantor; and
· it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes, in from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.
The delivery of the Notes was made against payment on the Notes on February 6, 2015, which was the fifth business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as "T + 5"). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the next succeeding business day will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.
The Company has agreed to pay the Initial Purchaser certain customary fees for its services in connection with the Offering and to reimburse it for certain out-of-pocket expenses.
From time to time, the Initial Purchaser and its affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial banking, financial advisory and other services to us and our affiliates for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchaser or its affiliates are arrangers and lenders under the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and have received customary fees in connection therewith. Pursuant to the Refinancing Transactions, the proceeds of the Offering will be used to, among other things, repay in full all outstanding amounts under the Bridge Facility Agreement, all of which are owed to the Initial Purchaser. The Initial Purchaser or its affiliates also may enter into hedging arrangements with the Group in connection with the Refinancing Transactions. See also "Use of Proceeds."
258

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchaser and its affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investment and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of any of the Company or the Guarantors, including the Notes.
259

LEGAL MATTERS Various legal matters will be passed upon for us by Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, as to matters of United States federal and New York state law, and by Advokatfirmaet BA-HR DA and Advokatfirmaet Wiersholm AS, as to the matters of Norwegian law. Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the Initial Purchaser by Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, as to matters of United States federal and New York state law, and by Arntzen de Besche Advokatfirma AS, as to the matters of Norwegian law.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS The consolidated financial statements of Hurtigruten for each of years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 included in this offering memorandum have been audited by Ernst & Young AS, independent auditors, as stated in their reports appearing herein. Ernst & Young AS is a member of Den Norske Revisorforening (the Norwegian Institute of Public Accountants). Our independent auditor is PricewaterhouseCoopers AS. PricewaterhouseCoopers AS has been our independent auditor since April 24, 2014. PricewaterhouseCoopers AS is a member of Den Norske Revisorforening (the Norwegian Institute of Public Accountants).
261

ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS Hurtigruten and the Company are incorporated under the laws of Norway. All our directors and executive officers live outside the United States. Substantially all our and their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, although we have appointed an agent for service of process under the Indenture governing the Notes, it may be difficult for you to serve process on those persons or us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.
Norway Norwegian courts will, as a general rule, not recognize or enforce judgments rendered by a foreign court
unless Norway has entered into a bilateral or multilateral treaty with the relevant country or countries regarding the recognition and enforcement of judgments and subject to the provisions of section 19-16 of the Norwegian Dispute Act of 2005 No. 90 (Tvisteloven) (the "Dispute Act"). Due to the Lugano Conventions on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (the "Lugano Convention"), Norwegian courts will recognize as a valid judgment, and enforce, any final civil judgment obtained in a foreign court in a state which is a party to the Lugano Convention, without a further reexamination of the merits of the case. The exceptions stated in the Lugano Convention itself will apply. The United States is not a party to the Lugano Convention. As of the date of this offering memorandum, there is no such treaty between the United States and Norway in place.
If there is no treaty between Norway and the relevant jurisdiction regarding the recognition and enforcement of judgments, or the relevant treaty is not applicable, a judgment rendered by a foreign court (e.g. the courts of United States) may nevertheless be recognized and enforced in Norway without further reexamination of the merits of the case if the foreign proceedings and the judgment itself fulfill the conditions stated in the Norwegian Enforcement Act of 1992 No. 86 (Tvangsfullbyrdelsesloven) and the Dispute Act. Such conditions can include (without limitation):
· the respective parties thereto have submitted the matter in dispute in writing to a court or tribunal in the agreed jurisdiction,
· there is no other mandatory venue for such dispute, · such judgment obtained is final and enforceable in and pursuant to the laws of the country where it was
issued, and · the acceptance and enforcement of the judgment shall not be in conflict with Norwegian mandatory
laws or public policy. Where a Norwegian party has accepted the jurisdiction of a foreign court in a written agreement, any judgment rendered pursuant to that agreement will be enforceable in Norway in accordance with the provisions of sections 4-6 and 19-16 of the Dispute Act.

Notes to the accounts
Unaudited
Note 1 Accounting policies
The interim financial report for the group includes Hurtigruten ASA with subsidiaries and associated companies. The interim financial report does not include all information which will appear in the annual financial report which is prepared in accordance with all effective IFRS-standards, and should therefore be read in connection with the annual report for 2013.
The annual report 2013 for the company can be obtained through a request to the company's main office or on the website www.hurtigruten.com. The accounting policies applied in the interim financial reporting are described in the note of accounting policies in the annual report for 2013.
In the preparation of the interim financial report, estimates and assumptions have been applied, which has affected assets, liabilities, revenues and costs. Actual figures can deviate from estimates applied.
Note 2 Restatement of earlier reported interim periods
Discontinued operations
As part of the company's plan to divest non-strategic assets, the bus business was classified as held-for-sale and discontinued operations at 31 December 2013. Comparative figures in the income statement for 30 September 2013 have been restated.
Note 3 Financial risk management
There are potential risks and uncertainties that can affect the operation of the companies in the group. This may lead to actual results deviating from expected and historical results. Information concerning the most important risks and uncertainties is disclosed in the latest annual report published on the company website www.hurtigruten.com. The group's most important risks and uncertainties are described in the directors' report and in note 4 to the consolidated accounts.
There have been no material changes in the financial risk management since the annual report for 2013 was published.
Note 4 Contingencies
Membership in the industrial fund for nitrogen oxides
Hurtigruten ASA is a member of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise`s (NHO) nitrogen oxide (NOx) Fund. The main objective of the Environmental Agreement concerning reductions of NOx and the NHO`s NOx Fund is to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide. The Fund is a joint venture to which affiliated businesses can apply for support for emission-reducing measures. Payment to the Fund replaces the nitrogen oxide tax for affiliated businesses.
The Environmental Agreement concerning reductions in NOx for 2011­2017 was signed on 14 December 2010 by 15 business organisations and the Ministry of the Environment. The agreement is a prolongation of the Environmental Agreement concerning reductions in NOx for the period 2008­2010. The Environmental Agreement and the additional declaration form the basis for work performed by the NHO`s NOx Fund. The signatories of the Environmental Agreement for the period 2011­2017 have undertaken to reduce their overall NOx emissions by 16 000 tonnes and to maintain the emission reductions achieved for the entire period. During this period the agreement has annual and biennial targets that are to be met, which can be broken down into 3 000 tonnes in 2011, 2 000 tonnes in 2012, 4 000 tonnes in 2013 and 2014, 4 000 tonnes in 2015 and 2016 and 3 000 tonnes in 2017. The Environmental Agreement concerning reductions in NOx for 2008­2012 was satisfied through a total reduction of 18 000 tonnes of NOx each year. The Fund has also reported that the targets for 2011 and 2012 were satisfied and that the achieved NOx reduction to meet the 2013 and 2014 commitments are on track.
F-9

The Norwegian Environment Agency monitors whether individual reduction targets have been achieved. Deviations of more than 10 per cent of reduction targets trigger a collective fine, under which businesses must pay the nitrogen oxide tax for the pro rata share of the target that has not been satisfied. However, the businesses will never pay more than the official government rate for nitrogen oxide tax.
Both Environmental Agreements have been approved by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA). The 2011­2017 Environmental Agreement was approved by the ESA on 19 May 2011, and the 2008­2010 Environmental Agreement was approved on 16 July 2008.
NOK 11,5 million in nitrogen dioxide tax was recognised in Hurtigruten`s consolidated financial statements as of 30. September 2014 (as of 30 September 2013: NOK 11,6 million). Dispute with Stranda Hamnevesen port authority
In summer 2013 Stranda Hamnevesen instigated legal proceedings against Hurtigruten ASA concerning non-payment of passenger handling and harbour-related fees in the total amount of NOK 4 million. On 6 January 2014 Sunnmøre District Court ruled that Stranda could not claim either docking fees or passenger-handling fees from Hurtigruten for 2012 and 2013. The ruling is not legally binding as Stranda has appealed the case. However, the case is of significance in that it is the first case dealing with the application of the new Harbour Act, and will be of particular importance with regard to the establishment of legal principles. The appeal was heard in the High Court in mid-October, with expected ruling in November.
Note 5 Information about operating segments The group's operating segments comprise the following three product areas: Hurtigruten Norwegian coast,
MS Fram and Spitsbergen. Activities which do not naturally fall within these areas are combined in Other business.
The operating segments are reported in the same way as the internal reporting to the company's board and executive management.
Note 6 Assets classified as held-for-sale and discontinued operations Assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale are presented on separate lines on the balance sheet under
current assets and current liabilities respectively. Previous periods are not reclassified on the balance sheet, according to the IFRSs.
Discontinued operations are a part of the business which is either sold or classified as held-for-sale. Profit or loss for discontinued operations is reported separately from income from continuing operations. Results from the previous period for discontinued operations are reclassified in order to get comparable numbers.
The group's bus business is classified as held-for-sale and discontinued operations at 30 September 2014. Hurtigruten reported in a stock exchange announcement of 8 July that it had entered into an agreement with Boreal Transport Nord AS on the transfer of Hurtigruten ASA's 71.3 per cent shareholding in AS TIRB. The transaction was completed on the 4 September with a loss of NOK 3 million that is included in result for discontinued operations. The divestment is a part of the company's plan to divest non-strategic assets.

Assessment of fair value The level hierarchy used for the measurement of fair value is based on the following categories: · Listed price in an active market for an identical asset or liability (Level 1) · Valuation based on observable factors, either directly (price) or indirectly (derived from prices), other than listed price (used in Level 1) for the asset or liability (Level 2) · Valuation based on factors not obtained from observable markets (unobservable assumptions) (Level 3)

The following table presents the group's assets and liabilities measured at fair value at 30 September 2014:

There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 or between Level 2 and 3 from 31 December 2013 to 30 September 2014.
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets is based on the market prices on the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and these prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. The market price used for financial assets is the current bid price, and the price used for financial liabilities is the current asking price. These instruments are included in Level 1 and comprise the fair value of some forward bunker oil contracts and other securities.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by means of various valuation methods. The group uses various methods and makes assumptions based on the prevailing market conditions on the balance sheet date. If all the significant data inputs that are

F-13

required to determine the fair value of an instrument are observable data, then the instrument will be included in Level 2. This includes the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange options, interest rate swaps and some forward bunker oil contracts.
The nominal value less impairment for losses incurred on trade receivables and the nominal value of trade payables are assumed to approximate the fair value of the items.
If one or more of the significant data inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument will be included in Level 3.
Particular valuation methods that are used to assess financial instruments include:
· Quoted market or trading price for corresponding instruments.
· Fair value of interest rate swap contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flow based on the observable yield curve.
· Fair value of forward contracts in a foreign currency is calculated as the present value of the difference between the agreed forward price and the forward price on the balance sheet date multiplied by the contract volume in a foreign currency. The relevant interest rate on the balance sheet date is used for calculation of the present value.
· Other methods, such as discounted cash flows, are used to determine the fair value of the remaining financial instruments.

The Hurtigruten coastal service is influenced by seasonal factors with the main season traditionally from May through August. In the recent years the company has developed seasonal concepts, "Hunting the light" for the winter season, "Arctic Awakening" in spring and "Autumn Gold" in the fall. This has increased the number of cruise nights in for instance the months of February and March. The itinerary and fleet of the company is according to the Hurtigruten public procurement contract, which involves daily departures from Bergen all year through.
Explorer cruises with MS Fram is cyclic because the cruises are concentrated around four geographic areas (different parts of the year); the Antarctic, Svalbard, Greenland and cruise between the Antarctic and the Arctic. The land based Svalbard operation has a main season reaching from March through August. This activity is operated by the subsidiary Spitsbergen Travel group.

Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements
are described below. Unless otherwise stated in the description, these policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented.
2.1 Basic policies The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as established by the EU.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, with the following modifications:
· financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRSs requires the use of estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. Areas that involve a high degree of such judgments, or are highly complex, and areas where assumptions and estimates are of material importance for the consolidated financial statements are described in more detail in note 3A.
The Group's consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to uniform accounting policies for similar transactions and events under similar conditions.
2.2 Consolidation policies The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the parent company and its
subsidiaries as of 31 December 2013.
a) Subsidiaries and consolidation Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to
govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are exercisable or convertible as of the balance sheet date are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the time a controlling influence is established and until such time as the controlling influence ceases to exist.
Intragroup transactions, intercompany balances and unrealised intragroup profits and losses are eliminated. If necessary, the subsidiaries' financial statements are restated to achieve consistency with the Group's accounting policies.
b) SPEs A sale-leaseback solution was carried into effect in 2002 with the Hurtigruten ship MS Richard With,
whereby Kystruten KS acquired the ship and leased it back for a 15-year period. A similar sale-leaseback solution was carried into effect with the Hurtigruten ship MS Nordlys, whereby Kirberg Shipping KS acquired the ship and leased it back for a 15-year period. On the basis of established contracts and the Group's assessments of the control principle, Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS are considered to be SPEs (special purpose entities) and thus consolidated in the Hurtigruten Group. This has been done by recognising the ship's book value and external liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Previously recognised gains are corrected against equity. The KS's financial statements have been restated to apply the same accounting policies as used by the Hurtigruten Group.
F-26

c) Associates Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Significant
influence normally exists for investments where the Group owns 20­50 per cent of the voting capital. Investments in associates are initially recognised at cost and subsequently using the equity method.
The Group's share of associates' profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and is added to the book value of the investments. The Group's share of associates' other comprehensive income is recognised in the Group's other comprehensive income and is also added to the book value of the investments. The Group does not recognise any share of an associate's losses in its income statement if this results in the book value of the investment falling below zero (including unsecured receivables from the entity), unless the Group has assumed liabilities or made payments on behalf of the associate.
2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies a) Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the business: i) that engages in business activities as a result of which the company receives operating revenues and incurs costs, ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the company's ultimate decision-maker with a view to determining which resources should be allocated to the segment and to assess its earnings, and iii) for which separate financial information exists.
The Group has three operating segments, called product areas: Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast, Explorer products/MS Fram and Spitsbergen. Activities that do not naturally fall within these segments are bundled in Other business.
b) Translation of foreign currencies (i) Functional and presentation currency
The financial statements of the individual entities in the Group are measured in the currency used in the economic area in which the entity primarily operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Norwegian kroner (NOK), which is both the parent company's functional currency and the Group's presentation currency.
(ii) Transactions and balance sheet items Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the transaction rate. Realised
foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are recognised in the income statement. If the currency position is considered a cash flow hedge, gains and losses are recognised as other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction is implemented, after which the currency position is transferred to the result on ordinary activities.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on loans, cash and cash equivalents are presented (net) in the income statement as financial income or expenses.
(iii) Group companies The income statement and balance sheets of Group entities whose functional currency differs from the
presentation currency are translated in the following manner: · The balance sheet is translated at the rate in force at the balance sheet date · The income statement is translated at the transaction rate. Average rates are used as an approximation of the transaction rate
F-27

· Translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and specified separately in equity as a separate item
c) Revenue recognition Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised at the fair value, net of VAT, returns, discounts,
and rejects. Sales are recognised when revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that the economic benefits
associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and specific criteria related to the various forms of sale that are listed below are met. The Group bases its accounting estimates on historic income, an assessment of the type of customer and transaction concerned, as well as any specific conditions attached to the individual transaction.
Revenues are recognised in the income statement as follows:
(i) Sales of services and travel Sales of services are recognised in the accounting period when the service is rendered and/or delivered. For
ship voyages, this is based on the days the passenger is on board. Revenues related to ship voyages are accrued on the basis of the number of days the voyage lasts before and after the end of the accounting period.
(ii) Sales of goods The Group's sales of goods primarily relate to sales of food, souvenirs and other kiosk products onboard the
ships. Sales are recognised in income when the customer has received and paid for the goods. Payment for retail transactions is usually made in the form of cash or by credit card. The revenue is recognised in the income statement including the credit card fees incurred for the transaction. The fees are recorded as costs to sell.
(iii) Public procurement The Group has an agreement with the Ministry of Transport and Communications to operate the Bergen--
Kirkenes coastal route. Revenues received from public procurement are recognised in the income statement on a continuous basis
over the year on the basis of existing contracts. These contracts are primarily based on a tender, where the company has a fixed contract sum for planned (annual) production. There are specific conditions and calculation methods for the indexation of the contract sum. Any changes beyond the planned production are compensated/ deducted utilising agreed-upon rates set out in the agreements, and recognised in the periods in which they occur.
d) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment consist primarily of ships (Hurtigruten ships), land and buildings (hotels,
offices and workshops) as well as buses. Property, plant and equipment are recognised at cost less depreciation and any impairments. Cost includes costs directly associated with the acquisition of the asset.
Periodic maintenance is recognised in the balance sheet and expensed over the period until the next periodic maintenance. Ongoing maintenance for all ship types is expensed continuously during the period in which the work is performed.
F-28

Land is not depreciated. Other operating assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, such that the cost is depreciated to residual value over the asset's expected useful life. Expected useful life is determined on the basis of historical data, as well as the standard useful economic lifetimes in the industry. Residual value is calculated on the basis of estimated sales values for operating assets at the end of their expected useful life. Expected useful life is:

Ships

12­30 years

Buildings 25­100 years

Vehicles 5­12 years

Other 3­10 years

The useful life and residual value of operating assets are assessed on every balance sheet date and amended as necessary. When material components of operating assets have different useful lives, these operating assets are recognised as their various components. These components are depreciated separately over each component's useful life. At the end of each accounting period operating assets are assessed for indications of lasting impairment and, in the event of such impairment, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. When the book value of an operating asset is higher than the estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to the recoverable amount.

Gains and losses on disposals are recognised in the income statement under "Other (losses)/gains--net", as the difference between the sales price and the book value.

e) Intangible assets (i) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is classified as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the acquisition at the time of acquisition (point f).
Goodwill recognised in the balance sheet is tested annually for impairment.

(ii) Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are largely directly associated with development costs for computer systems
recognised in the balance sheet at cost, if the criteria for recognition in the balance sheet are met. Expenses recognised in the balance sheet as custom developed computer systems largely comprise payroll costs and hiredin consultants in connection with the development.
The criteria for recognising custom developed intangible assets in the balance sheet are: · It is technically feasible to complete the development of the software so that it is available for use · Management intends to complete the development of the software and take it into use · It can be proved probable that the company will take the asset into use · Future economic benefits to the company associated with use of the asset can be calculated · Adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete the development and take
the software into use · Development costs for the asset can be measured reliably
The intangible assets are considered to have a limited life span, and are amortised over their expected useful life. Assessments are made at the end of each accounting period to find any indications of impairment of intangible assets. If there are indications of impairment, the intangible assets are written down to their recoverable value when this is lower than the book value.
Other development expenditures that do not meet the criteria for recognition in the balance sheet are expensed as they are incurred.
F-29

f) Impairment of non-financial assets Intangible assets with indefinite useful life and goodwill are not amortised but are tested annually or more
frequently if there are indications of impairment. Depreciated property, plant and equipment and amortised intangible assets are assessed for impairment when there is any indication that the book value may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's book value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing impairments, non-current assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). At each reporting date the possibility of reversing previous impairment of non-financial assets (except goodwill) is assessed.
g) Discontinued operations and non-current assets held-for-sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held-for-sale if their book values will be recovered
through sale rather than continued use. This condition is deemed to be fulfilled if a sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its current condition. Management at the relevant level must have made a commitment to complete the sale and the transaction must be expected to be completed within one year of the classification date.
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) that are classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of previous book value and net sales value, and are not depreciated.
A discontinued operation is a segment that has been classified as held-for-sale, and which represents a material business area.
Net profits or losses after tax for discontinued operations are reported separately in income from continuing operations. Results from the previous periods for discontinued operations are reclassified in order to obtain comparable figures. Assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale are presented on separate lines in the balance sheet under current assets and current liabilities respectively. Previous periods are not restated in the balance sheet.
h) Financial assets
(i) Classification The Group classifies financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, as well
as loans and receivables. The classification depends on the object of the asset. Management determines the classification of financial assets on initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held-for-trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if it was acquired primarily to provide a profit from short-term price fluctuations. Derivatives are categorised as held-for-trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed payments that are not traded in an active market. These are classified as current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are classified as "trade and other receivables" in the balance sheet (point l).
(ii) Recognition and measurement Regular purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade-date, which is the day the Group
commits to purchase or sell the asset. All financial assets that are not recognised at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets recognised at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs
F-30

are expensed in the income statement. Investments are de-recognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investment expire or when these rights have been transferred and the Group has substantially transferred all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial assets recognised at fair value in profit or loss are carried at fair value after initial recognition in the balance sheet. Loans and receivables are carried in successive periods at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
Gains or losses from changes in fair value of assets classified as "financial assets at fair value through profit or loss", including interest income and dividends, are included in the income statement under financial items in the period in which they arise. Dividends from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are included in financial income when the Group's right to receive payments is established.
i) Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are only offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
j) Impairment of financial assets
Assets recognised at amortised cost
At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the assets (a "loss event") and the impact of that loss event (or events) on estimated future cash flows can be estimated reliably.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's book value and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The asset's book value is reduced and the amount of the loss recognised in the consolidated income statement.
If the impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the fall in value was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor's credit rating), the previous loss is reversed in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment testing of trade receivables is described in point l.
k) Derivatives and hedging
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value on an ongoing basis. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group classifies derivatives that are part of a hedging instrument as either:
(i) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair-value hedge) or
(ii) hedges of variable cash flows with a particular risk associated with a recognised asset, liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Such assessments are documented both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis.
The fair values of derivatives used for hedging purposes are presented in note 11C. Changes in the equity item hedging are presented in note 16. The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining term of the hedging item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or current liability if the remaining term of the hedging item is less than 12 months. Derivatives held for trading purposes are classified as current assets or liabilities.
F-31

Cash flow hedging
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges is recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Losses and profits on the ineffective portion are recognised in the income statement.
Hedge gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are recognised as income or expense in the period during which the hedged item affects the income statement (for example, when the planned sale is taking place). Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate loans are recognised in the income statement under "financial expenses". Gains or losses on the ineffective portion are recognised in the income statement. When the forecast hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (such as inventories or property, plant and equipment), the gains and losses previously recognised within other comprehensive income are transferred to the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in cost of goods sold or in depreciation of property, plant and equipment.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement. When a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
l) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise or services sold in the ordinary course of business. If settlement is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are classified as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised and presented at the original invoice amount and written down following "loss events" which have an impact on the payment of the receivable that can be reliably estimated. Thus, trade receivables are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The interest element is disregarded if it is insignificant.
m) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, bank deposits and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities in the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents are defined differently in the balance sheet and cash flow presentation. Restricted capital is included in the balance sheet presentation but not in the cash flow presentation.
n) Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are classified as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are valued at fair value on first-time recognition in the balance sheet. Subsequently, trade payables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The interest element is disregarded if it is insignificant.
o) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, borrowings are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings as part of the effective interest.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless there is an unconditional right to defer payment of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. Repayments due within one year are therefore classified as current liabilities.
F-32

p) Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition of operating assets are recognised in the balance
sheet until the asset is ready for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed on an ongoing basis.
q) Current and deferred income taxes The income tax expense comprises income taxes payable and deferred income tax. Tax is recognised in the
income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In such case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is calculated in accordance with the tax laws and regulations enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the company's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax laws are subject to interpretation. Based on management's assessment, a provision is made for expected tax payments when necessary.
Deferred tax is calculated on all temporary differences between the tax-written-down and consolidated financial values of assets and liabilities.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and tax laws which have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and which are expected to apply when the deferred income tax asset is realised, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the tax-reducing temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are recognised net to the extent that there is a desire and ability to settle the taxes within the same tax regime.
r) Pension liabilities, bonus schemes and other employee remuneration schemes (i) Pension liabilities
The Group's companies operate various pension schemes. The schemes are generally funded through payments to life insurance companies. The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. The liability recognised in the balance sheet connected with the defined benefit schemes is the present value of the defined benefits at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the pension assets. The pension liability is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Variances from estimates arising from experience adjustments or changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in equity within other comprehensive income, in the period in which they arise.
Changes in benefits under the defined pension plans are expensed in/credited to the income statement.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as payroll costs when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as a financial asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
(ii) Profit-sharing and bonus schemes The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing plans at the time the specific
criteria for allocation are fulfilled.
F-33

(iii) Share-value-based remuneration The Group has several share-based remuneration schemes where the company receives services from
employees as consideration for share options in the Group. The fair value of options allocated during the period is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model at the time of allocation. The fair value is expensed over the vesting period.
At each balance sheet date the company reviews its estimates for the number of options expected to be entered into as a result of any changes in the number of employees covered by the scheme. The company recognises any effects of changes to the original estimates in the income statement over the residual vesting period.
All share-based remuneration plans are settled by the allocation of shares.
(iii) Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal
retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
s) Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events and it is probable that an outflow of financial resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination benefits. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses; however, provisions for unprofitable contracts are recognised.
t) Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are
classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
When the Group has substantially assumed all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying lease object, leases are classified as finance leases and the lease object and lease liability are recognised in the balance sheet. The Group has no material finance leases.
u) Dividends Dividend distribution to owners of the parent is recognised as a liability in the Group's financial statements
when the dividends are approved by the general meeting.
v) Government grants The Group receives material grants in the form of grants for trainee schemes and net salary subsidies. These
grants are recognised net (as a cost reduction) together with the other payroll costs.
2.4 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures (i) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The Group made changes to its accounting policies in 2013. Below are new standards, amendments and interpretations, which were adopted as of the 2013 financial year.
· IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. Amendments affecting the presentation of other comprehensive income, differentiating between items that later will be reversed in profit or loss and items that will not be reversed in profit or loss.
F-34

· IAS 19 Employee Benefits was amended in June 2011. Interest expenses and the expected return on pension assets will be replaced with a net interest amount calculated by applying the discount rate to the net pension obligation (asset). The Group has implemented this amendment since 1 January 2013. Other amendments to IAS 19, including recognition of estimate variances in other comprehensive income and expensing of previous years' entitlements on changes in the scheme, have already been applied by the Group through existing options already permitted by the standard. Please refer to point r on pension obligations for further information.
· IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement defines what is meant by the term "fair value" under IFRSs and provides a uniform definition of how fair value should be determined under IFRSs and defines which additional disclosures should be provided when fair value is used. The Group uses fair value as a measurement criterion for certain assets and liabilities. Application of the standard has increased the scope of disclosures; however, with no further material changes to the financial statements.
· Other issued standards and interpretations that have entered into force do not affect the Group and will have no impact on the financial statements.
(ii) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that have not entered into force and which the Group has not early adopted:
· IFRS 9 Financial Instruments regulates the classification, measurement and accounting treatment of financial assets and liabilities. The Group plans to apply IFRS 9 when the standard takes effect and has been approved by the EU. The Group has still not assessed whether IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will affect the financial statements. The date IFRS 9 enters into force is not yet known but this is not expected to be earlier than 1 January 2018.
· IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements is based on current principles which involve applying the control concept as the decisive criterion in determining whether a company should be included in the consolidated financial statements of a parent company. The implementation of the standard is not expected to result in any material changes to the financial statements. The Group is planning to apply the standard for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
· IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements. The standard regulates the accounting treatment of arrangements where the Group has joint control together with other entities. The standard focuses more on the rights and obligations under the arrangement than on the legal structure. The implementation of the standard is not expected to result in any material changes to the financial statements. The Group is planning to apply the standard for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
· IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities contains disclosure requirements for financial interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, structured entities and other non-consolidated companies. Application of the standard will result in extra disclosures, but not in any further material changes to the financial statements. The Group is planning to apply the standard for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
Note 3A Important accounting estimates and judgments Estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on past experience, consultation
with experts, trend analyses and a number of other factors, including forecast future events that are deemed probable under current circumstances.
3.1 Key accounting estimates and assumptions The Group makes estimates and assumptions about the future. By their very nature, the accounting estimates
that are made as a result of the above processes will therefore rarely fully correspond with the final outcome. Estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the book values of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below.
F-35

(a) Estimated impairment of goodwill
The Group performs annual tests to assess potential impairment of goodwill, cf. note 2.3 e) i). The estimated recoverable amount is determined using the present value of budgeted cash flows for the cash-generating units. These calculations require the use of estimates (note 9) to establish the required rate of return for the period, cash flows and the growth factor of the cash flows.
The Group does not apply a general growth factor beyond expected inflation for cash flows when testing goodwill for impairment. The required rate of return used to discount cash flows is calculated as a weighted average of the return on equity and the required rate of return on interest-bearing debt. This calculation utilises an estimate of the risk-free interest rate, risk premium, beta and the liquidity premium.
(b) Ships
Useful economic lifetime
The level of depreciation depends on the estimated economic lifetime of the ships. These estimates are based on history and experience relating to the Group's ships. The estimates are reviewed at regular intervals. A change in the estimate will affect depreciation in future periods.
Estimated impairment of ships
Where there are indications of such, the Group tests whether ships have suffered any impairment, see note 2.3 d). The estimated recoverable amount is determined using the present value of budgeted cash flows for the cash-generating units. Ships are considered within their segment as a collective cash-generating unit. These calculations require the use of estimates (note 8) for the required rate of return for the period, cash flows and the growth factor of the cash flows.
The Group does not use a general growth factor beyond expected inflation for cash flows when testing ships for impairment. The required rate of return used to discount cash flows is calculated as a weighted average return on equity and the required rate of return on interest-bearing debt. This calculation utilises an estimate of the riskfree interest rate, risk premium, beta and the liquidity premium.
(c) Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques and information from the contract counterparty. The Group uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and to make assumptions based mainly on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. Please refer to note 11A for further information.
(d) Pension assumptions
The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes. Measurement of pension costs and pension obligations for defined benefit plans involves the application of a number of assumptions and estimates, including relating to the discount rate, future salary levels, expected employee turnover rate, the return on plan assets, annual pension increases, expected adjustments to G (the National Insurance Scheme basic amount) and demographic factors.
The Group has pension obligations in Norway and Germany. The discount rate used to calculate pension obligations in Norway is based on 15-year corporate covered bonds, with an additional provision taking into account relevant terms to maturity for the pension obligations. Covered bonds are primarily issued by credit institutions to listed Norwegian commercial and savings banks and are secured against loans directly owned by the credit institution. The discount rate applied in Norway as of 31 December 2013 was 4.1 per cent; in accordance with guidance from the Norwegian Accounting Standards Board on the determination of pension assumptions as of 31 December 2013 this rate was 4.0 per cent. For obligations in Germany, the discount rate is determined based on the interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, with terms to maturity approximating to the term of the related pension obligation. The discount rate applied in Germany as of 31 December 2013 was 3.1 per cent.
F-36

Changes in pension assumptions will affect the pension obligations and pension cost for the period. Pension obligations are significantly affected by changes in the discount rate, life expectancy and expected salary and pension adjustments.
Please refer to note 19 for more information about pensions.
(e) Income tax Income tax is calculated based on results in the individual Group companies. The Group is subject to
income taxes in several jurisdictions. Calculation of the period's tax expense and distribution of tax payable and deferred income tax for the period requires a discretionary assessment of complex tax regulations in several countries. Consequently, uncertainty attaches to the final tax liability for many transactions and calculations. Where there is a discrepancy between the final tax outcome and the amounts that were initially recognised, this discrepancy will impact the recognised tax expense and provision for deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made. Please refer to note 18 for more information about income tax.
(f) Deferred income tax assets The basis for recognising deferred income tax assets is based mainly on the utilisation of tax loss
carryforwards against future taxable income in the Group. The assessment is made based on management's estimates of future profits in the Group and includes an assessment of the Group's future strategy, economic developments in the markets in which the Group operates, future tax regimes and the Group's ability to deliver forecast synergies. In preparing the financial statements, management has found the future taxable income to be sufficient to utilise the recognised deferred income tax assets. Please refer to note 18 for more information on deferred income tax assets recognised in the balance sheet.
(g) Disputes, claims and regulatory requirements The Group is a party to, or affected by, disputes, claims and regulatory requirements the outcome of which
is to a large extent unknown. Management considers the probability of negative outcomes and opportunities for estimating any loss in the event of such negative outcomes. Unexpected events or changes to factors taken into consideration that have an impact on specific conditions, may result in increases or reductions to provisions. Such changes may also necessitate the recognition of provisions for conditions that were previously assessed as an unlikely outcome or for which it was previously not possible to make reliable estimates.
3.2 Key judgments affecting the entity's accounting policies (a) Discontinued operations
The Group's bus business is reported under Other business. This business has been approved for sale and due to the nature of the market, management deems it appropriate to classify the business as discontinued in the annual financial statements in accordance with IFRS 5. Please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
(b) Joint venture Spitsbergen Travel AS owns 50 per cent of the voting rights in a joint arrangement, where the agreement
requires unanimity for all decisions on relevant activities. The joint arrangement is organised as a limited company (Green Dog Svalbard AS) and gives participants the right to the net assets of the limited company. The above is therefore classified as a joint venture and recognised in accordance with the equity method.
Note 3B Restatement of comparative figures In accordance with company's planned sale of non-strategic shareholdings, the bus business was classified
as a discontinued operation as of 31 December 2013. The comparative figures in the income statement for 2012 have been restated.
F-37

IAS 19, Employee Benefits, has been significantly amended in that the net interest expense is now calculated based on the net deficit measured applying the discount rate to the balance at the start of the year. The effect of this is that the expected return on plan assets in excess of the discount rate for 2012 has been set to zero in the comparative figures.

Note 4 Financial risk management The Group uses financial instruments such as bank loans and bond loans. In addition, the Group utilises
financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables, etc., that are directly related to day-to-day operations. The Group utilises certain financial derivatives for hedging purposes.
4.1 Financial risk factors The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency, price, fair-
value interest rate and variable interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overarching risk management goal is to increase predictability for the Group's operations and to minimise the impact of fluctuations in macro conditions on the Group's results and financial position.
The Group has defined overarching principles for risk management which encompass guidelines for specific areas such as currency, interest rate and credit risk and the use of financial derivatives. The board of directors approves the Group's risk management strategy and reviews this annually. The CFO function is responsible, in consultation with the CEO, for conducting ongoing tactical risk management in line with the approved strategy, including exposure analyses and reporting.
(a) Market risk (i) Currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk in multiple currencies, in particular, EUR, USD and GBP. Currency risk arises from future ticket sales as well as recognised assets or liabilities. In addition, fuel cost is quoted in USD. Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency which is not the entity's functional currency.
The Group's policy is to hedge up to 80 per cent of expected cash flows in EUR and GBP for up to the next 18 months, using transparent and liquid financial derivatives, normally futures contracts combined with options. Hedges have been made on around 75 per cent of expected cash flows in EUR for 2014 and on around 40 per cent for 2015. Hedges have also been made on just under 40 per cent of expected cash flows in GBP for 2014. The company refinanced its debt in March 2012, where portions of the loan can be converted from NOK to EUR to achieve a "natural hedge". The conversion right applies for the entire term of the loan.
The price of oil, and thus bunker fuel, is internationally traded in USD, while the Group purchases bunker fuel in NOK. The risk can therefore be split into a currency element and a product element. The currency element is partially aligned with the Group's cash flow exposure in USD, and the product risk is hedged separately.
Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS are consolidated in accordance with IFRS SIC-12 Consolidation-- Special Purpose Entities. Kystruten KS has portions of its debt in EUR and USD. The Group is therefore exposed to currency risk when paying interest and converting this debt to NOK. The debt in EUR and USD is partially hedged through the Group's net revenues in these currencies. Kirberg Shipping KS redeemed all its bank loans in August 2013, in the process significantly reducing foreign currency risk on the translation of liabilities in the KSs.
The Group has some investments in foreign subsidiaries whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.
F-42

The table below shows the Group's sensitivity to potential changes in the exchange rate for NOK against relevant currencies in relation to the exchange rate as of 31 December, with all other variables held constant. Changes mainly relate to foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of financial derivatives, borrowings, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and cash and cash equivalents and other investments.

The calculations assume that the NOK depreciates by 5 per cent against the relevant currencies. With an equivalent appreciation of the NOK, the amounts would have an equal and opposite value. In 2013 the effect on equity was different to the effect on the income statement due to the fact that currency derivatives are recognised as hedges, and changes in value on these are recognised directly in equity. As of 31 December 2012 the Group only held currency options held for trading purposes, meaning that the effect on the income statement and equity of the above are the same.

(ii) Price risk
The Group is exposed to bunker fuel price risk, and the board of directors has approved a strategy of quarterly rolling hedges of 0­100 per cent of estimated future consumption for one to six future quarters, where the Group hedges a larger share of consumption in the near future and a smaller share further ahead. In addition, the Group has a stop-loss strategy where it attempts to hedge the unhedged amount if the price of oil rises above a predefined threshold. Hedges are made in the forward market on 87 per cent of expected bunker consumption for 2014, distributed with a higher proportion in the coming quarters, and a lower proportion towards the end of the year.

The table below shows the Group's sensitivity to potential price increases of bunker fuel, with all other variables held constant.

These calculations are based on the average unhedged bunker volume, and indicate how an increase of 20 per cent in bunker prices would have had an impact on the financial statements for 2012 and 2013. The effect on equity is different than the effect on the income statement because these forward hedges fulfil the requirements for hedge accounting, and unrealised changes in value are recognised directly in equity.

(iii) Cash flow and fair-value interest rate risk
The Group's interest rate risk is associated with current and non-current borrowings. Loans subject to a variable interest rate present a risk to the Group's overall cash flow. Fixed interest rates expose the Group to fairvalue interest rate risk. Over the course of 2012 and 2013, the Group's loans at variable interest rates were mainly in NOK. A portion of the loans assumed by Kystruten KS (SPE) and Kirberg Shipping KS (SPE) are in EUR and USD.
The Group manages its variable interest rate risk through variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps involve converting loans with variable interest rates to fixed-interest loans. Through interest rate swaps, the Group enters into contracts with other parties to swap the difference between the contract's fixed interest rate and the amount of the variable interest rate calculated on the agreed principal. In connection with the refinancing of the company's long-term debt in March 2012 a new strategy was adopted for hedging interest, under which 40­60 per cent of the Group's total exposure is to be hedged. Non-amortising interest rate swaps have been entered into corresponding to 58 per cent of the Group's total debt on refinancing. As of 31 December 2013 around 60 per cent of the company's total debt was hedged.

The table below shows the Group's sensitivity to potential changes in interest rate levels, with all other variables held constant. These calculations take all interest-bearing instruments and associated derivatives into consideration.

An increase of 0.5 per cent in the variable interest rate would increase the Group's interest costs by approximately NOK 4.4 million (2012: NOK 4.1 million) after tax. Equity would have been NOK 2.0 million higher (2012: NOK 3.4 million higher) as a result of the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps.

(b) Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk. Sales to end users are settled in cash or with recognised credit cards. Sales to external agents are made either through prepayment/credit cards or through invoicing. The Group has routines to ensure that credit is only extended to agents with a satisfactory credit rating. Individual risk exposure limits are set based on internal and external assessments of credit ratings.
The counterparties to the derivative contracts and cash transactions are limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Group has routines that limit exposure to credit risk relating to individual financial institutions.
As of 31 December 2011 a larger share of trade receivables than normal was due but not impaired. This related to non-settled supplementary compensation from the government for the purchase of services under the former coast route agreement, and outstanding claims against the contracting party in connection with the winding down of the Group's charter activities in Australia. The Group received just over NOK 300 million in liquidity in December 2012 in connection with these two cases, but at the same time had to recognise a loss for the charter business along with a further provision relating to the supplementary agreement with the government. Hurtigruten no longer has any balance sheet claims relating to the charter business, and the remaining receivable due from the government represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications in connection with the supplementary agreement has been fully written down as a result of the provision. For further details please see Note 5 Contingencies and Note 12 Receivables and other investments.

(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk management includes maintaining a sufficient level of liquid assets geared to operational and investment plans, and ensuring the availability of sufficient funding from committed credit facilities. The Group has a group account that ensures that part of the Group's unrestricted liquidity is available to the parent company, and which also optimises availability and flexibility in liquidity management. The Group's finance function has overall responsibility for managing the Group's liquidity risk. Rolling liquidity forecasts are prepared in order to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquidity reserves to satisfy the Group's obligations and financial loan covenants.
Hurtigruten used 2013 to establish a framework for future profitability. In a transitional year, a NOK 83 million improvement in the result on underlying operations justifies the company's change in direction and shows that the company is on the right track. The efficiency-improvement programme that was launched in December 2012 resulted in some far-reaching changes for the company in the year under review. The programme comprised four phases, the first three of which will reduce expenses by NOK 60 million compared with 2012, with full effect from 2014. The 2013 financial statements reveal that NOK 42 million in savings have already been achieved in 2013. The fourth phase of the efficiency-improvement programme is now underway targeting areas relating to the operation of the ships. The measures will reduce expenses by an estimated NOK 100 million, the full effect of which will be felt from 2015. In addition, revenues are expected to be boosted on the back of higher on-board sales.
As of 10 February 2014, after currency effects, gross revenues from advance bookings along the Norwegian coast were up 7 per cent against the previous year, while the corresponding increase for
F-44

MS Fram was even higher at 14 per cent. In isolation, currency effects generated a cash inflow of almost NOK 50 million due to the fact that around 75 per cent of the expected cash flow in EUR has been hedged for 2014.

Lower expenses and higher revenues from the extensive efficiency-improvement programme, encouraging advance bookings and the effects of currency hedging will all help to ensure that the company is able to service the financial obligations that mature over the next year.

4.2 Risk relating to asset management The Group's long-term goal for asset management is to ensure continued operations, and thereby secure
future dividends for shareholders. Furthermore, the object is to maintain an optimal capital structure, and thereby reduce the Group's capital costs. There has been no significant change in the Group's asset management from 2012 to 2013.
In order to maintain and improve the capital structure, the Group has no plans for declaring dividends or repaying capital to shareholders in the short term. In recent years the Group has prioritised divesting non-core activities. No additional share issues have been planned for the short and medium terms.
The Group monitors capital structure on the basis of, inter alia, the equity ratio. This ratio is calculated as equity divided by total assets and as of 31 December 2013 was 22.5 per cent (31 December 2012: 22.1 per cent). The company meets the requirements for equity in the loan agreements (Note 17).
Note 5 Contingencies As of 31 December 2013, the Group had contingent liabilities relating to bank guarantees and other
guarantees, in addition to other contingent outcomes in the course of regular operations. No significant liabilities are expected to arise with respect to contingent outcomes with the exception of the provisions that have already been provided for in the financial statements (note 20).
Membership of the NOx Fund Hurtigruten ASA is a member of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise's (NHO) NOx Fund. The main
objective of the Environmental Agreement concerning reductions of NOx and the NHO's NOx Fund is to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide. The Fund is a joint venture to which affiliated businesses can apply for support for emission-reducing measures. Payment to the Fund replaces the nitrogen oxide tax for affiliated businesses.
The Environmental Agreement concerning reductions in NOx for 2011­2017 was signed on 14 December 2010 by 15 business organisations and the Ministry of the Environment. The agreement is a prolongation of the Environmental Agreement concerning reductions in NOx for the period 2008­2010. The Environmental Agreement and the additional declaration form the basis for work performed by the NHO's NOx Fund. The signatories of the Environmental Agreement for the period 2011­2017 have undertaken to reduce their overall NOx emissions by 16,000 tonnes and to maintain the emission reductions achieved for the entire period. During this period the agreement has annual and biennial targets that are to be met, which can be broken down into 3,000 tonnes in 2011, 2,000 tonnes in 2012, 4,000 tonnes in 2013 and 2014, 4,000 tonnes in 2015 and 2016 and 3,000 tonnes in 2017. The Environmental Agreement concerning reductions in NOx for 2008­2012 was satisfied through a total reduction of 18,000 tonnes of NOx each year. The Fund has also reported that the targets for 2011 and 2012 were satisfied.
The Norwegian Environment Agency monitors whether individual reduction targets have been achieved. Deviations of more than 10 per cent of reduction targets trigger a collective fine, under which businesses must pay the nitrogen oxide tax for the pro rata share of the target that has not been satisfied. However, the businesses will never pay more than the official government rate for nitrogen oxide tax.
Both Environmental Agreements have been approved by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA). The 2011­2017 Environmental Agreement was approved by the ESA on 19 May 2011, and the 2008­2010 Environmental Agreement was approved on 16 July 2008.
NOK 15.5 million in nitrogen dioxide tax was recognised in Hurtigruten's consolidated financial statements for 2013 (2012: NOK 15.3 million).
F-46

Dispute with Stranda Hamnevesen port authority In summer 2013 Stranda Hamnevesen instigated legal proceedings against Hurtigruten ASA concerning
non-payment of passenger handling and harbour-related fees in the total amount of NOK 4 million. On 6 January 2014 Sunnmøre District Court ruled that Stranda could not claim either docking fees or passenger-handling fees from Hurtigruten for 2012 and 2013. The ruling is not legally binding as Stranda has appealed the case. However, the case is of significance in that it is the first case dealing with the application of the new Harbour Act, and will be of particular importance with regard to the establishment of legal principles.

Note 6 Segment information
(a) Primary reporting format--operating segments (product areas)
The operating segments are identified based on the same reporting that Group management and the board apply to their evaluations of performance and profitability at a strategic level. The company's ultimate decision-maker, which is responsible for allocation of resources to and assessment of earnings generated by the operating segments, is defined as the board and Group management. The classification is broken down into the product areas Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast, Explorer Products/MS Fram, and Spitsbergen. Activities that do not naturally fall within these three segments are bundled in Other business.

The reporting of segment assets and liabilities is not part of the internal management reporting in the Group. Material assets and liabilities are monitored at Group level, and certain key figures (such as trade receivables) are assessed based on the status of the individual legal entities. Segment assets and liabilities are therefore not presented per operating segment.
Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast This product area comprises the company's operation of the Bergen to Kirkenes coastal service in
accordance with the contract with the Norwegian government represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. This service is operated using 11 ships with daily calls to 34 ports between Bergen and Kirkenes. Although passenger transport represents the greatest portion of the service, the cargo service is also substantial.
Explorer products/MS Fram This product area includes the cruise activities in Polar waters--Antarctica, Svalbard, Greenland and cruises
between Antarctica and the Arctic. The cruises are operated by MS Fram, which was custom-built to operate in Polar waters.
Spitsbergen The Spitsbergen product area includes Arctic experience tourism on Svalbard. Activities in Svalbard are
organised under the Spitsbergen Travel Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hurtigruten ASA. The activities include overnight accommodation in the company's two hotels and one guest house, catering business, and excursions and expeditions.
Other business Other business includes the company's two remaining fast ferries, a minor portfolio of properties and less
extensive activities that cannot naturally be classified in the other reporting segments The Group's activities that are classified as discontinued are included in Other business. Activities relating
to buses managed by AS TIRB and the subsidiary Cominor AS are classified as discontinued operations as of 31 December 2013. The comparative figures in the income statement for 2012 have been restated. The Group's charter activities relating to the leasing of ships to the oil industry were also classified as discontinued in 2012. The business was discontinued from 1 January 2012 and the result from this business recognised in 2012 reflects the discontinued items.
Eliminations Eliminations in 2012 and 2013 primarily consisted of the subsidiary Cominor AS's excursions for
Hurtigruten.
(b) Secondary reporting format--geographical segments Operating revenues cannot be reliably allocated to separate geographical segments. Group management only
monitors geographical segments for selected areas of consolidated sales.

Indications of potential impairments in ships are assessed each quarter. The impairment test of the ships used for the Norwegian coastal service as of 31 December 2013 did not reveal any indication of impairment as the ships' respective recoverable amounts were higher than their book values.
The following impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses have been done in 2013:
· An impairment loss of NOK 100 million was recognised in 2008 to reflect the expected fair value of the Explorer ship MS Fram. As a result of improved earnings and a healthy order book at the start of 2014, the impairment loss was reversed in its entirety as of 31 December 2013. The reversal was based on a value-in-use calculation for the Explorer segment. A discount rate of 9.3 per cent was used to determine the value-in-use calculation. After adjusting for depreciation for the period, the reversal of the net impairment loss amounts to NOK 78 million.
· The Groups two remaining fast ferries were sold in 2014, and NOK 7.5 million of the previous impairment loss was reversed as of 31 December 2013 in order to reflect fair value.

F-51

· The bus business has recognised an impairment loss of NOK 5 million as a result of the loss of a driving contract for the Norwegian Armed Forces.
· Following ANS Havnebygningen's sale of the building where the company hired business premises in Tromsø, an impairment loss of NOK 9 million was recognised in respect of the upgrading of the premises in the consolidated financial statements.

Leases
In 2012 and parts of 2013 the Group leased office premises and another building from HRG Eiendom AS, along with office premises from the associate ANS Havnebygningen. As part of the company's efficiencyimprovement and reorganisation measures implemented in 2013 both buildings and a residence in HRG Eiendom AS were sold during 2013. The commercial building owned by ANS Havnebygningen was also sold. Consequently, the Group gradually started to lease other premises from external parties during 2013. The parent company and subsidiaries also incur external lease costs relating to premises. The parent company's charter of Hurtigruten ships has been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements (sale-leaseback agreement with two limited partnerships). Please see Note 20 concerning the details of this agreement. Furthermore, the parent company and subsidiaries have external costs related to the leasing of other equipment and means of transport. These are operating leases.

Goodwill has arisen in connection with business acquisitions. Other intangible assets primarily comprise capitalised development expenses related to ICT systems (booking, inventories, etc.) with a limited lifespan. The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over 3­10 years. Amortisation is presented under amortisation in the financial statements.
Impairment losses in 2013 relate to ICT systems that have been scrapped and replaced with new systems.

Assessment of fair value The level hierarchy used for the measurement of fair value is based on the following categories: · Listed price in an active market for an identical asset or liability (Level 1) · Valuation based on observable factors, either directly (price) or indirectly (derived from prices), other than listed price (used in Level 1) for the asset or liability (Level 2) · Valuation based on factors not obtained from observable markets (unobservable assumptions) (Level 3)

There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 or between Level 2 and Level 3 during the year.
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets is based on the market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and these prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. The market price used for financial assets is the current bid price, and the price used for financial liabilities is the current asking price. These instruments are included in Level 1 and comprise the fair value of some forward bunker oil contracts and other securities.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by means of various valuation methods. The Group uses various methods and makes assumptions based on the prevailing market conditions at the balance sheet date. If all the significant data inputs that are required to determine the fair value of an instrument are observable data, then the instrument will be included in Level 2. This includes the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange options and interest rate swaps and some forward bunker oil contracts.
The nominal value less impairment for losses incurred on trade receivables and the nominal value of trade payables are assumed to approximate the fair value of the items.
If one or more of the significant data inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument will be included in Level 3. Non-current borrowings measured at amortised cost whose fair value is disclosed in note 17 are recorded at Level 3.
Particular valuation methods that are used to assess financial instruments include:
· Quoted market or trading price for corresponding instruments.
· Fair value of interest rate swap contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flow based on the observable yield curve.
· Fair value of forward contracts in a foreign currency is calculated as the present value of the difference between the agreed forward price and the forward price at the balance sheet date multiplied by the contract volume in a foreign currency. The relevant interest rate at the balance sheet date is used for calculation of the present value.
· Other methods, such as discounted cash flows, are used to determine the fair value of the remaining financial instruments.

Note 11C Derivative financial instruments
All derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet, while changes in fair value are adjusted in other comprehensive income, and recognised in the income statement when the hedged cash flow is recognised in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of currency options held for trading purposes are recognised as operating revenues and changes in the fair value of bunker options held for trading purposes are classified as bunker costs.
F-58

Fair value is calculated based on the mid-price set by the contract counterparty based on current prices in the market on the reporting date.

Derivatives held for trading purposes are classified as current assets or liabilities. The entire fair value of hedging instruments is classified as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedging object is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedging object is less than 12 months.

No ineffectiveness was recordable for any of the cash flow hedges in 2012 or 2013. All the forecast cash flows that were hedged in 2013 continue to qualify for hedge accounting.

a) Forward foreign exchange contracts
The nominal amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts as of 31 December 2013 was NOK 1,157 million (as of 31 December 2012 there were no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that qualified for hedge accounting).
The hedged, highly probable transactions in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates over the next 18 months. The forward foreign exchange contracts satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting in accordance with IFRSs and the changes in the fair value are adjusted in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses on contracts recognised in other comprehensive income as of 31 December 2013 will be recognised in the income statement in the same accounting periods that the hedged transactions affect the income statement. Realised gains and losses are allocated to passenger revenues. In 2013 realised losses allocated to passenger revenues amounted to NOK 20.8 million (2012: gains of NOK 31.1 million).

(b) Interest rate swaps
The nominal principal on outstanding interest rate swaps as of 31 December 2013 was NOK 1,785 million (2012: NOK 2,088 million).
As of 31 December 2013 the fixed interest rate ranged from 2.7 to 4.5 per cent (2012: from 2.7 to 5.3 per cent). The variable interest rates were NIBOR. Gains and losses on interest rate swaps recognised in other comprehensive income as of 31 December 2013 (note 16), will continuously be reversed in the income statement until the bank borrowings (note 17) have been repaid. Realised gains and losses are allocated to interest expenses. In 2013 realised losses totalling NOK 31.4 million were allocated to interest expenses (2012: NOK 19.6 million).
F-59

(c) Oil derivatives
The nominal amount of outstanding forward bunker oil contracts as of 31 December 2013 was NOK 266 million (2012: NOK 163 million).
The hedged, highly probable transactions are expected to occur at various dates over the next 12 months. The forward contracts mature monthly. Forward bunker oil contracts satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting under IFRSs and changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Gains or losses on oil derivatives recognised in other comprehensive income as of 31 December 2013 (note 16), will be recognised in the income statement in the same accounting periods that the hedged transactions affect the profit or loss. Realised gains or losses are allocated to bunker costs. In 2013 realised gains of approximately NOK 0 were allocated to bunker costs (2012: NOK 5.3 million).

The Group primarily borrows at variable interest rates, and interest rate swap contracts (swaps) are used for the portion of the borrowings that are to have a fixed interest rate, as dictated by the Group's hedging policy. For further information on the hedging instruments, see note 11C (Derivative financial instruments).
The fair value is based on discounting cash flows from borrowings by a discount rate based on the market's expectations of the future variable interest rates or the agreed fixed rate. The discount rate for 2013 ranged from 5.0 to 10.1 per cent (2012: from 5.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent).

An agreement has been entered into for the sale of two of the remaining fast ferries with an agreed delivery date of the middle of March 2014. In connection with the delivery a loan connected with the fast ferries will be redeemed in the amount of NOK 43 million. The entire loan is recognised in the first year's instalments of noncurrent debt.
In December 2013 Hurtigruten ASA utilised a current drawdown facility of NOK 150 million that has to be repaid in its entirety no later than 30 June 2014. The loan is recognised in the first year's instalments of noncurrent debt.
Hurtigruten ASA refinanced its debt in the first quarter of 2012, and the new loan agreement with the banks is dated 7 March 2012. The agreement for a total of NOK 2.6 billion is with a bank syndicate consisting of eight banks, two of which are foreign banks. The term of the loan is five years with annual instalments of NOK 260 million, where the first instalment falls due in September 2012. The financial covenants are as follows:
· Minimum working capital
At the end of each quarter the Group's current assets including unused credit facilities shall be greater than the Group's current debt excluding the first year's instalments on non-current debt.
· Minimum liquidity holding
The Group must maintain unrestricted liquidity of at least NOK 200 million over the term of the loan.
· Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio/liquidity holding
At the end of each quarter the consolidated EBITDA excluding gains/losses on the sale of assets must be equal to or greater than the Group's annual debt obligations and dividend payments, or the Group's unrestricted liquidity including unused credit facilities must be a minimum of NOK 350 million.
· Minimum equity ratio
The Group's equity ratio must be measured on 30 June and 31 December each year, and shall be 22.5 per cent up to 31 December 2014. Thereafter until the expiration of the agreement term the equity ratio requirement will increase to 25 per cent. The convertible bond loan issued by Hurtigruten ASA is regarded as equity in relation to the loan agreement. From 31 December 2012 until 30 June 2013 the equity ratio requirement was temporarily reduced to 20 per cent.
As part of its refinancing Hurtigruten ASA issued an unsecured bond loan of NOK 500 million. The loan has a term of five years and one month and is irredeemable until its final maturity date in April 2017. The financial covenants are as follows:
· Maximum senior debt facilities ratio
The Group's hedged debt shall be less than 65 per cent of the Group's total assets until 30 June 2013. This percentage will be reduced annually by 5 per cent from 1 July 2013. From 1 July 2015 to the expiration of the term of the agreement, hedged debt shall be lower than 50 per cent of total assets.

F-68

· Maximum leverage ratio
The Group's interest bearing debt shall be less than 6.5 per cent of the consolidated EBITDA, excluding gains/losses on the sale of assets from 31 December 2012. This percentage shall be reduced annually by 0.5 per cent from 31 December 2013. From 31 December 2012 until 30 September 2013 this requirement was temporarily increased to 12.5 per cent. The requirement for 6.5 per cent also had to be satisfied using normalised EBITDA as a base for the calculation. Normalised EBITDA in this context is the consolidated EBITDA adjusted for i) losses arising in connection with the charter arbitration case (cf. notes 5 and 12) and ii) the provision relating to the ESA case (cf. notes 5 and 12).
· Minimum liquidity holding
The Group must maintain unrestricted liquidity of at least NOK 200 million over the term of the loan.
· Minimum working capital
At the end of each quarter the Group's current assets including unused credit facilities shall be greater than the Group's current debt excluding the first year's instalments on non-current debt.
In March 2012 Hurtigruten ASA redeemed the bond loan issued in February/March 2009 pursuant to the loan agreement.
The company also redeemed the convertible bond loan in June 2012 in accordance with the loan agreement.

The convertible bond loan is recognised in the balance sheet as follows

The fair value of the debt component and the component related to the equity conversion was determined when the loan was issued. The fair value of the debt component, which is included in the non-current liabilities, is calculated using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible loan. The residual amount, which represents the value of the equity component, is recognised in equity under "Other equity not recognised in the income statement".
The loan's interest expenses are calculated based on the effective interest rate method by using an effective interest rate of 10.0 per cent for the debt component.
In 2012 Hurtigruten ASA made both scheduled and deferred instalment payments on the bareboat lease to the two limited partnerships Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, from which the company leases two ships. The deferred instalment payments were in accordance with the agreement entered into with the banks and limited partnerships in February 2009. The agreement specified that no instalment payments should be paid on the loan between March 2009 and December 2011. The deferred instalments were paid back on a pro rata basis together with the instalments due for payment from February 2012 to February 2013.

The deferred income tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards are recognised in the balance sheet to the extent that the Group can utilise the tax loss carryforward against future taxable income. The Group has significant tax-increasing temporary differences relating to the same tax authority as the tax loss carryforward. In preparing the financial statements, management deems the future taxable income to be sufficient to utilise the recognised deferred income tax assets. This assessment has been made based on conservative management estimates of future profits in the Group, in which particular importance has been attached, for example, to the Group's procurement contract with the government in effect until 2019 inclusive, as well as the effects of the Group's planned and completed restructuring methods. On grounds of prudence the Group has elected not to recognise the deferred income tax asset relating to the tax loss for the year. Tax losses may be carried forward for an indefinite period in Norway. The tax loss carryforward as of 31 December 2013 was NOK 2,861 million (2012: NOK 2,836 million).

Note 19 Pensions
The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. For the defined contribution plans the cost is equal to the contributions to the employees' pension savings during the period. The future pensions are dependent on the size of the contributions and the return on the pension plan.
The Group has defined benefit plans in Norway and Germany. For the Norwegian defined benefit plans, the employer is responsible for paying an agreed pension to the employee based on his/her final salary. Future defined benefits are mainly dependent on the number of contribution years, salary level upon reaching retirement age and the size of the National Insurance benefits. These obligations are covered through an insurance company. In addition to the pension obligations that are covered through insurance schemes, the company has unfunded pension obligations that are funded from operations, primarily for former key management personnel. Pension fund assets managed by insurance companies are regulated by local legislation and practice. The relationship between the company and the insurance company is regulated by applicable legislation. The boards of the insurance companies are responsible for managing the plans, including making investment decisions and determining premium levels. An agreed fixed sum per month is paid as a pension for the German pension plan, where most beneficiaries receive the same agreed amount, while three former directors receive a considerably higher payment. The German plan is organised as a CTA (contractual trust arrangement), where the plan assets are earmarked for the pension fund, but the company's management determine how the assets are to be invested.

The new Contractual Early Retirement (AFP) Scheme Act adopted by the Storting in 2010 entailed the derecognition and recognition in the income statement of provisions related to the old contractual early retirement scheme. Provisions were set aside to cover the assumed underfunding of the old contractual early retirement scheme. The new AFP early retirement scheme is based on a tri-party collaboration between employer and employee organisations, and the government. The government covers one-third of the pension expenses for the early retirement scheme, while affiliated enterprises cover the remaining two-thirds. The scheme is recognised as a defined benefit multi-entity plan in the financial statements. This means that each individual company shall account for its proportional share of the scheme's pension obligations, plan assets and pension costs. Until reliable and consistent information is available for allocation, the new contractual early retirement scheme will be accounted for as a defined contribution plan. The Group's Norwegian onshore employees are the only members of the scheme. At the reporting date there were a total of 596 beneficiaries, of whom 363 were connected to discontinued operations. On exit an annual pension is calculated based on 0.314 per cent of annual pensionable income up to 7.1G from the age of 13 to 61. In 2013 the premium amounted to 2 per cent of salary between 1G and 7.1G, while in 2014 the premium will be 2.2 per cent. A total of NOK 2.6 million was paid into the scheme in 2013.
The established pension plans cover 1,729 Group employees. The pension costs for the period illustrate the agreed future pension entitlements earned by employees in the financial year.

Risk The Group is exposed to several types of risk through the defined benefit pension plans, the most significant
of which are as follows.
Investment volatility The pension obligations are calculated using a discount rate based on the interest rate on bonds. If the
investment in the pension fund assets provides a lower return than the bond interest rate, this gives rise to a deficit. All the plans comprise shares that are expected to give a higher return than interest on bonds over the long term, but which may, however, result in increased volatility and risk over the short term. As the pension plans' obligations mature, the target will be to reduce the share of risky investments to better match the obligations.
Changes in interest rates on bonds A reduction in interest rates on bonds would increase the pension plans' obligations. However, this would
be partially offset by an increase in the return on the investments in bonds.

F-75

Inflation risk
The defined benefit pension plans' obligations are exposed to inflation risk. An increase in inflation could result in higher obligations. The key assets of the pension plans are either unaffected by inflation (fixed-interest bonds) or loosely correlated with inflation (shares). A rise in inflation could therefore increase deficits in the plans.

Life expectancy
The payment obligation only applies to the remaining life expectancy of the plan beneficiaries. A rise in life expectancy would increase the plans' obligations. This is particularly important for the Norwegian plan, where the adjustment for inflation results in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy. A new mortality table, K2013, was introduced during the reporting period to reflect the rising average life expectancy of the Norwegian population. The effect of the above is shown under changes in demographic assumptions under recalculations of the change in the pension obligation.

Asset management
A basic intention of asset management of plans organised through pension insurance companies is to secure cover of the non-current obligations by delivering a competitive annual return at least equal to the guaranteed interest rate. Asset management is based on a long-term arrangement of the investment portfolios, tailored to the company's long-term obligations. Norwegian legislation imposes restrictions on concentration risk in the investment of all plan assets. The investments are made in collective portfolios with cautious, moderate risk. The assets in the German plan are currently invested in listed funds that are managed by a professional asset manager. The fund follows a multi-asset strategy with a conservative risk profile. The composition of the fund is regularly changed to accommodate optimal returns and risk management. At the end of the year fifty per cent of the assets were invested in shares in various markets. Consequently, these shares are exposed to risk attaching to the performance of global equity markets. While company management cannot influence the fund's investments, it may at any time elect to exit fund investments.

The sensitivity analysis above is based on a change in one of the assumptions, with all other assumptions remaining unchanged. In practice this would not happen as more than one assumption could vary simultaneously. The sensitivity calculation is performed applying the same method as the actuarial calculation used to determine the pension obligation in the balance sheet.

The method and the assumptions in the sensitivity analysis have not been changed compared with the previous year.

The Group only has one open defined benefit plan under which beneficiaries have entitlements. Consequently, this is the only plan affected by changes in annual salary growth and adjustments to G.

Change in accounting policy
IAS 19, Employee Benefits, has been significantly amended in that the net interest expense is now calculated based on the net deficit measured applying the discount rate to the balance at the start of the year. The effect of this is that the expected return on plan assets in excess of the discount rate for 2012 has been set to zero in the comparative figures. The change has increased the pension cost for 2012 by NOK 2.1 million. Please refer to note 3B for the restatement of comparative figures.

F-77

Estimate deviation
A new mortality table, K2013, was introduced to replace the previously used K2005 table for Norwegian pension plans during the year under review. Application of the new table has increased the pension obligation due to the longer inherent life expectancy. The resulting changes have been recognised as estimate deviations for demographic assumptions.

Deferred revenue recognition
A line-by-line recognition has been carried out with respect to the investment contribution received, including a possible repayment obligation. Revenue recognition of the investment contribution occurs in conjunction with depreciation and amortisation of the associated asset. This year's recognised revenue is NOK 167,000. The remainder of the investment contribution as of 31 December 2013 amounts to NOK 5.1 million.
Restructuring
A provision was recognised in 2012 for costs relating to function duplication and the closing and relocation of offices in connection with the adopted efficiency-improvement programme covering the onshore organisation in Hurtigruten Pluss AS. This provision was utilised in its entirety in 2013.
Legal disputes
Legal charges were brought against AS TIRB and its subsidiary Cominor AS by Troms County Council in May 2009. A complaint was filed with the Court of Conciliation in December 2009. Troms County Council claimed that the companies had overcharged for occasional assistance, and for unforeseen and unplanned driving, for a total amount of NOK 25 million, excluding interest. The Hålogaland Court of Appeal delivered its ruling in the case on 26 November 2012 and ordered TIRB and Cominor to pay compensation of NOK 11.7 million to Troms County Council. The ruling will not be appealed.

Share-value-based remuneration
In 2010 the company established a share-based option scheme for all permanent employees of Hurtigruten ASA and wholly owned subsidiaries who owned shares in Hurtigruten ASA as of 31 December 2010. Hurtigruten ASA entered into an option agreement that grants the CEO the right to acquire up to three million shares. In 2013 the board of Hurtigruten ASA allocated NOK 12 million share options to Group management and selected key personnel in the Hurtigruten Group. Please refer to note 21 for further details.

Investment obligations The company has no contractual investments at the balance sheet date.

Operating lease commitments--Group company as lessee
The Group leases an office in Tromsø, in addition to some other offices. These leases have varying payment dates, price adjustment clauses and renewal rights. The Group also leases machinery and transport equipment. Leasing costs for the year are specified in note 8. The Group has no non-cancellable leases.
The parent company entered into contracts in December 2002 and June 2003 to sell and charter back the Hurtigruten ships MS Richard With and MS Nordlys. These ships were sold to Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, respectively, and chartered back for a period of 15 years with an option for an additional 5 years on market terms. For the first 15 years the charter hire payments consist of three components; fixed hire in NOK, fixed hire in USD/EUR and a variable element in USD/EUR.
Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS are consolidated in accordance with IFRS SIC-12--Special Purpose Entities in the consolidated financial statements. Recognised bareboat charter hire payments in the income statement of the parent company have thus been eliminated against charter hire income in the limited partnerships on consolidation.
Hurtigruten ASA will undertake and pay for the operation, insurance and all necessary ongoing maintenance of the ships. In the charter agreements between the limited partnerships and Hurtigruten ASA, identical requirements (financial covenants) have been stipulated for Hurtigruten ASA for the term of the agreements, which the company has as a component of its non-current loan agreements linked to ships. Please see note 17 with regard to these financial covenants.
A breach of the financial covenants may entail a termination of the charter agreements by the lessor. The Group has satisfied all the financial covenants as of 31 December 2013.
In connection with the financial restructuring in February 2009, an agreement was reached with the limited partnerships Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, which entailed that the instalment component of the charter hire under the charter-party agreement with the two limited partnerships would not be payable for the period up to 31 December 2011. The postponed instalments would, however, be added to the instalments that were paid in 2012 and will be paid 2013, thereby reverting to the original repayment plan in August 2013. An increase in the charter hire was also agreed to compensate for the increased costs incurred by the limited partnerships under their loan agreements because of the changes in the repayment profile. In addition, it has been agreed that Hurtigruten's option to buy back MS Nordlys and MS Richard With will be cancelled.

Note 21 Share-value-based remuneration
The company has the following three share-value-based remuneration agreements
· An option scheme was offered to all the permanent employees of Hurtigruten ASA and wholly owned subsidiaries who owned shares in Hurtigruten ASA as of 31 December 2010. This scheme expired on 31 December 2013. The market price was the average weighted value for December in the respective years. The average market price for the second half of 2010, which was NOK 4.01, would be used as the basis for calculating gains. The number of shares held on 31 December 2010 had to be kept until the options are exercised. Any gains would be distributed as an extraordinary bonus without any right to holiday pay after the end of each year. The employees would pay ordinary income tax on the gain.
· Hurtigruten ASA entered into an option agreement that grants the CEO the right to acquire up to three million shares. The options may not be exercised for fewer than one million shares at a time. The options mature on 30 April 2017.
· In 2013 the board of Hurtigruten ASA allocated NOK 12 million share options to Group management and selected key personnel in the Hurtigruten Group. The share options have an exercise price of NOK 3.50 and can be exercised for the first time no earlier than in three and no later than after four years.

After this period the fair value of the allotted options, calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was NOK 0.62 per option (2012: NOK 0.19 per option). The most important input data includes the share price as of 31 December 2013 of NOK 3.47 (as of 31 December 2012: NOK 3.00), the exercise prices shown above, a standard deviation of the expected share return of 43 per cent (2012: 33 per cent) and an annual risk-free interest rate of 1.30 per cent (2012: 1.49 per cent). Volatility is measured using the standard deviation of the expected return based on a statistical analysis of the daily share prices for the whole of 2013. The volatility of the share option scheme for Group management and selected key personnel in the Hurtigruten Group in 2013 is measured by reference to daily share prices in the option period in 2013, where the standard deviation of the expected return on the scheme is 55 per cent.
The fair value is recognised as an expense under payroll costs over the vesting period. A total of NOK 0.3 million was recognised as an expense in 2013 (2012: NOK 0.2 million).
F-80

In calculating gains for the option scheme for all permanent employees at Hurtigruten ASA, the average price in December each year will be measured against the average price for the second half of 2010, which was NOK 4.01. The average price in December 2013 was NOK 3.57 (2012: NOK 3.07), meaning that there was no gains calculation or payment for 2013. This option scheme expired on 31 December 2013.

Statement on the determination of salary and other remuneration for senior executives in Hurtigruten ASA Guidelines for determining the remuneration of senior executives in Hurtigruten ASA
The following guidelines have been specified with effect from 18 February 2014:
1. Definitions 1.1 Senior executives include the chief executive and other senior executives, cf. Proposition no. 55 (2005­
2006), which refers to the provisions of the Norwegian Accounting Act and Public Limited Liability Companies Act concerning "senior executives".
1.2 In these guidelines, a compensation scheme means a remuneration package comprising one or more of the following elements: Fixed salary, variable pay (bonuses, share-based programs, options, etc.) and other benefits (pension schemes, pay guarantee schemes, fringe benefits, and the like).
1.3 Severance pay refers here to compensation related to departure from the company and may involve a pay guarantee, other financial benefits and payments in kind.
2. Main principles for determining compensation schemes 2.1 Remuneration to senior executives in Hurtigruten ASA will be competitive but not market leading
compared with similar companies. 2.2 The main element in a compensation scheme should be fixed salary. 2.3 Compensation schemes shall be formulated to avoid unreasonable benefits arising as a result of external
circumstances which the executive management cannot influence. 2.4 The individual elements in a pay package shall be assessed from an overarching perspective, with fixed
salary, possible variable pay and other benefits such as pension schemes and severance pay viewed as a whole. The board of directors shall maintain an overview of the total value of each executive's agreed compensation.
2.5 Determining guidelines for the remuneration of senior executives is the responsibility of the entire board of directors. Remuneration of the group's chief executive is determined by the board of directors.
2.6 The board of directors shall ensure that remuneration schemes for senior executives do not have unfortunate effects for the company or weaken its reputation.
2.7 Senior executives shall not receive special remuneration for serving as directors of wholly-owned subsidiaries in the same group.
2.8 Agreements entered into before these guidelines came into effect may continue.
3. Variable pay Any variable pay shall be based on the following principles: 3.1 A clear connection shall exist between the underlying goals for the variable pay and the company's
objectives. 3.2 Variable pay shall be based on objective, definable and measurable criteria. 3.3 These criteria shall be based on conditions which the executive in question can influence. 3.4 Several relevant measurable criteria should be applied. 3.5 A variable pay scheme shall be transparent and clearly understandable. Identifying the anticipated and
the maximum payment for each participant in the programme is important when explaining the scheme. 3.6 The scheme shall be of limited duration. 3.7 Total variable pay received in any year should not exceed six months of fixed salary, unless exceptional
circumstances dictate otherwise.
F-86

4. Pension schemes
4.1 Pension terms shall be equivalent to those enjoyed by other employees in the company.
4.2 To the extent that a retirement age lower than the National Insurance retirement age of 67 years is agreed, it should generally not be lower than 65.
4.3 Agreements on pensions shall be based on the same years of pensionable service as for other comparable employees in the company.
4.4 Pension entitlements earned in other positions shall be taken into account.
4.5 Pension entitlements should not exceed 66 per cent of salary. Retiring at an age younger than 65 shall result in a lower pension entitlement.
4.6 The board of directors shall obtain an overview of the total cost of a pension agreement before it is entered into.

5. Severance pay
5.1 Severance pay can be agreed when a senior executive waives their right in advance to the employment protection provisions in the Norwegian Working Environment Act. Severance pay should not be provided in the event of voluntary resignation except in special circumstances.
5.2 Severance pay should not exceed 12 months fixed salary in addition to possible pay during the period of notice.
5.3 Should the person concerned be appointed to a new position or receive remuneration from an enterprise in which they are an active owner, severance pay should be reduced by a proportionate amount calculated on the basis of the person's new annual income. Such a reduction should first be made after the normal period of notice has expired.
5.4 Severance pay may be suspended if conditions exist which would have justified dismissal or if, during the severance period, irregularities or acts of negligence are discovered which might lead to compensation claims or to criminal charges against the person concerned.

Accounting policies
Hurtigruten ASA has chosen to adopt simplified International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in its parent company accounts, pursuant to section 3­9, paragraph 5 of the Norwegian Accounting Act, cf. regulation of 21 January 2008.
Applying the simplified version of IFRS to the parent company accounts means that valuation rules and accounting policies applied in the consolidated accounts also apply to the parent company, Hurtigruten ASA. See the group accounting policies for further information. A simplified application of IFRS enables the financial statements and note information to accord with the Norwegian Accounting Act (NGAAP). The financial statements and notes for the parent company have been organised in accordance with the NGAAP, with the exception of the comprehensive income statement which follows IFRS.
Shares in subsidiaries and associates are recorded in accordance with the cost method of accounting in the parent company accounts.
Note 1 Financial market risk
The company uses financial instruments such as bank loans and bond loans. In addition, the company has financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables, etc., which are directly linked to day-to-day operations. For hedging purposes the company makes use of certain financial derivatives.
As a result of its regular operations, the company is exposed to risks related, for example, to fluctuations in exchange and interest rates and bunker oil costs. Hurtigruten's overarching hedging strategy is to create predictability for the company's operations and reduce the impact volatility in macroeconomic conditions might have on the company's financial performance and standing. The primary management parameter is the expected cash flow. Extensive use is made of simple, transparent and liquid hedging instruments, mainly forward contracts, combined possibly with options.
Currency risk
The company operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk in multiple foreign currencies. in particular EUR, USD and GBP. Currency risk arises from future ticket sales as well as recognised assets or liabilities. In addition, fuel cost is quoted in USD. Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency which is not the entity's functional currency.
The company's strategy is to hedge up to 80 per cent of the expected cash flow in EUR and GBP up to 18 months into the future through the use of transparent and liquid instruments, usually forward contracts combined with options. Hedges have been made on around 75 per cent of expected cash flows in EUR for 2014 and on around 40 per cent for 2015. Hedges have also been made on just under 40 per cent of expected cash flows in GBP for 2014. The company refinanced its debt in March 2012, where portions of the loan can be converted from NOK to EUR to achieve a "natural hedge". The conversion right applies for the entire term of the loan.
Forward foreign exchange contracts
The nominal amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts as of 31 December 2013 was NOK 1,157 million (as of 31 December 2012 there were no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that qualified for hedge accounting).
The hedged, highly probable transactions in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates over the next 18 months. The forward foreign exchange contracts satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting in accordance with IFRSs and the changes in fair value are adjusted in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses on contracts recognised in other comprehensive income as of 31 December 2013 will be recognised in the income statement in the same accounting periods that the hedged transactions affect the income statement. Realised gains and losses are allocated to passenger revenues. In 2013 realised losses allocated to passenger revenues amounted to NOK 20.8 million (2012: gains of NOK 31.1 million).
F-95

Interest rate risk The company's interest rate risk is associated with current and non-current borrowings. Borrowings at
variable interest rates entail an interest rate risk for the company's cash flow. Fixed interest rate borrowings expose the company to a fair-value interest rate risk. In 2012 and 2013 the company's borrowings with variable interest rates were in NOK. The company manages the variable interest rate risk by means of variable-to-fixedinterest rate swap contracts. Interest rate swaps involve converting loans with variable interest rates to fixedinterest loans. The company enters into a contract with other parties to exchange the difference between the contract's fixed interest rate and the amount of the variable interest rate calculated on the agreed principal through the interest rate swaps. A new strategy was adopted for hedging interest rates in connection with the refinancing of the company's non-current debt in March 2012, under which 40­60 per cent of the company's total debt is to be hedged. Non-amortising interest rate swaps have been entered into equivalent to 56.5 per cent of the company's debt on refinancing. As of 31 December 2013 around 65 per cent of the company's total debt was hedged.
Interest rate swaps The nominal principal on outstanding interest rate swaps as of 31 December 2013 was NOK 1,750 million
(2012: NOK 2,050 million).
As of 31 December 2013 the fixed interest rate ranged from 2.7 to 3.1 per cent (2012: from 2.7 to 5.3 per cent). The variable interest rates were NIBOR. Gains and losses on interest rate swaps recognised in other comprehensive income as of 31 December 2013 will continuously be reversed in the income statement until the bank borrowings (note 10) have been repaid. Realised gains and losses are allocated to interest expenses. In 2013 realised losses totalling NOK 31.4 million were allocated to interest expenses (2012: NOK 19.6 million).
Bunkers The company is exposed to fluctuations in bunker oil prices. The price of oil, and thus bunker oil, is
determined in international trading in USD, while the parent company purchases bunker oil in NOK. The risk can therefore be split into a currency element and a product element. In its risk management strategy, the company has emphasised the need to coordinate risk, and has therefore chosen to reduce the bunkers risk while the currency risk is coordinated with the company's other currency exposures.
The company enters into revolving quarterly forward contracts for the next one to six quarters to hedge 0­ 100 per cent of the expected bunker oil consumption, with a greater share being hedged in the near future and less being hedged further into the future. In addition, the company has a stop-loss strategy where it attempts to hedge the non-hedged amount if the price of oil rises above a predefined threshold. Hedges are made in the forward market on 87 per cent of expected bunker consumption for 2014, distributed with a higher proportion in the coming quarters, and a lower proportion towards the end of the year.
Oil derivatives The nominal amount of outstanding forward bunker oil contracts as of 31 December 2013 was NOK
266 million (2012: NOK 168 million).
The hedged, highly probable transactions are expected to occur at various dates over the next 12 months. The forward contracts mature monthly. Forward bunker oil contracts satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting under IFRSs and changes in the fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Gains or losses on oil derivatives recognised in other comprehensive income as of 31 December 2013 will be recognised in the income statement in the same accounting periods that the hedged transactions affect the profit or loss. Realised gains or losses are allocated to bunker costs. In 2013 realised gains of approximately NOK 0 were allocated to bunker costs (2012: NOK 5.3 million).

The company is exposed to credit and liquidity risks. The company has no significant concentration of credit risk. Sales to end users are settled in cash or with recognised credit cards. Sales to external agents are made either through prepayment/credit cards or through invoicing. The company has routines to ensure that credit is only extended to agents with a satisfactory credit rating. Individual risk exposure limits are set based on internal and external assessments of credit ratings.
The counterparties to the derivative contracts and cash transactions are limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings. The company has routines that limit exposure to credit risk related to a single financial institution.
As of 31 December 2011 a larger share of trade receivables than normal was due but not impaired. This was due to the fact that additional compensation received from the Norwegian government for the purchase of services under the previous coastal service contract had not been settled pending a decision on an EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) inquiry as to whether additional compensation by the government contravened EU rules on state aid. The company also had outstanding claims against a subsidiary, which in turn had outstanding claims against contracting parties in connection with the discontinuation of the Group's charter business in Australia. The Group's liquidity was boosted by just over NOK 300 million in December 2012 as a result of settlements in these two cases; however, the Group also had to recognise further loss provisions. The Group no longer has any claims in the balance sheet regarding the charter business, but the parent company still has a receivable due from the subsidiary Hurtigruten Pty. Ltd. The residual receivable due from the Norwegian government represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications relating to the supplementary agreement has been fully written down as a result of the loss provision. These matters are discussed in further detail in note 2 Contingencies and in note 9 Combined items.
The company's strategy with regard to liquidity is to have sufficient cash, cash equivalents or credit facilities to finance its ongoing operations and investments. The Group has a group account that ensures that some of the Group's unrestricted liquidity is available to the parent company.
Note 2A Contingencies
As of 31 December 2013 the company had contingent liabilities relating to bank guarantees and other guarantees, in addition to other contingent outcomes in the course of regular operations. No significant liabilities are expected to arise with respect to contingent outcomes, with the exception of the provisions that have already been recognised in the financial statements (cf. note 20 to the consolidated financial statements).
Membership of the NOx Fund
Hurtigruten ASA is a member of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise's (NHO) NOx Fund. The main objective of the Environmental Agreement concerning reductions of NOx and the NHO's NOx Fund is to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide. The Fund is a joint venture to which affiliated businesses can apply for support for emission-reducing measures. Payment to the Fund replaces the nitrogen oxide tax for affiliated businesses.
The Environmental Agreement concerning reductions in NOx for 2011­2017 was signed on 14 December 2010 by 15 business organisations and the Ministry of the Environment. The agreement is a prolongation of the Environmental Agreement concerning reductions in NOx for the period 2008­2010. The Environmental Agreement and the additional declaration form the basis for work performed by the NHO's NOx Fund. The signatories of the Environmental Agreement for the period 2011­2017 have undertaken to reduce their overall NOx emissions by 16,000 tonnes and to maintain the emission reductions achieved for the entire period. During this period the agreement has annual and biennial targets that are to be met, which can be broken down into 3,000 tonnes in 2011, 2,000 tonnes in 2012, 4,000 tonnes in 2013 and 2014, 4,000 tonnes in 2015 and 2016 and 3,000 tonnes in 2017. The Environmental Agreement concerning reductions in NOx for 2008­2012 was satisfied through a total reduction of 18,000 tonnes of NOx each year. The Fund has also reported that the targets for 2011 and 2012 were satisfied.
F-97

The Norwegian Environment Agency monitors whether individual reduction targets have been achieved. Deviations of more than 10 per cent of reduction targets trigger a collective fine, under which businesses must pay the nitrogen oxide tax for the pro rata share of the target that has not been satisfied. However, the businesses will never pay more than the official government rate for nitrogen oxide tax.
Both Environmental Agreements have been approved by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA). The 2011­2017 Environmental Agreement was approved by the ESA on 19 May 2011, and the 2008­2010 Environmental Agreement was approved on 16 July 2008.
NOK 15.5 million was recognised in respect of the nitrogen oxide tax in Hurtigruten ASA's financial statements for 2013 (2012: NOK 15.3 million).

Dispute with Stranda Hamnevesen port authority
In summer 2013 Stranda Hamnevesen instigated legal proceedings against Hurtigruten ASA concerning non-payment of passenger handling and harbour-related fees in the total amount of NOK 4 million. On 6 January 2014 Sunnmøre District Court ruled that Stranda could not claim either docking fees or passenger-handling fees from Hurtigruten for 2012 and 2013. The ruling is not legally binding as Stranda has appealed the case. However, the case is of significance in that it is the first case dealing with the application of the new Harbour Act, and will be of particular importance with regard to the establishment of legal principles.

Note 2B Restatement of comparative figures
IAS 19, Employee Benefits, has been significantly amended in that the net interest expense is now calculated based on the net deficit measured applying the discount rate to the balance at the start of the year. The effect of this is that the expected return on pension assets in excess of the discount rate for 2012 has been set to zero in the comparative figures.

Intangible assets consist of internal/external development/adaptation of ICT systems and software related to the ships.

An impairment loss of NOK 100 million was recognised in 2008 to reflect the expected fair value of the Explorer ship MS Fram. As a result of improved earnings and a healthy order book at the start of 2014, the impairment loss was reversed in its entirety as of 31 December 2013. After adjusting for depreciation for the period, the reversal of the net impairment loss amounts to NOK 78 million.

The company's two remaining fast ferries were sold in 2014, and NOK 7.5 million of the previous impairment loss was reversed as of 31 December 2013 in order to reflect fair value.

Note 4 Assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations
HELD-FOR-SALE
As part of the company's plan to sell the non-strategic assets, the bus business was classified as held for sale as of 31 December 2013. The company's shares in the subsidiary AS TIRB were therefore classified in the same category.

In preparing the financial statements, management deems the future taxable income to be sufficient to utilise the recognised deferred income tax assets. This view is based on management's estimates of future profits generated by the company, where particular importance has been attached to the company's procurement contract with the government which runs until 2019, as well as the company's ongoing efficiency program. On grounds of prudence, the company has decided not to recognise the deferred income tax asset relating to the tax loss for the year. The is no restriction on the time tax losses may be carried forward.

Note 8B Creditworthiness of financial assets
Hurtigruten does not have a system that distinguishes between trade receivables and other receivables based on the counterparty's creditworthiness.

Receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to NOK at the rate in effect at the balance sheet date.
As of 31 December 2013 Hurtigruten's Australian subsidiary Hurtigruten Pty. Ltd. was being wound up as of 31 December 2013. Consequently, the company's trade and other current receivables from Group companies were significantly reduced.
F-105

As of 31 December 2012 the company's provisions for bad debts increased to NOK 377 million as of The increase was primarily attributable to two factors:
· The EFTA Court's ruling in the ESA case relating to the supplementary agreement with the government (from 2008) resulted in the recognition of loss provisions for contractual revenues in the amount of NOK 108 million.
· Hurtigruten's Australian subsidiary Hurtigruten Pty. Ltd. reached a settlement in the arbitration case concerning outstanding claims in connection with the chartering of MS Finnmarken. The settlement was made in December 2012 and resulted in the recognition of a further loss provision of NOK 99 million, in addition to the provision of NOK 46 million that had already been recognised as of 31 December 2011.
The increase in the first year's instalments is attributable drawings on a current credit facility in December 2013.

Deferred income tax and pension obligations are not included above.
An agreement has been entered into for the sale of two of the remaining fast ferries with an agreed delivery date of the middle of March 2014. In connection with the delivery a loan connected with the fast ferries will be redeemed in the amount of NOK 43 million. The entire loan is recognised in the first year's instalments of noncurrent debt.
In December 2013 the company used a current drawdown facility of NOK 150 million that has to be repaid in its entirety no later than 30 June 2014. The loan is recognised in the first year's instalments of non-current debt.
The company refinanced its debt in the first quarter of 2012, and the new loan agreement with the banks was dated 7 March 2012. The agreement for a total of NOK 2.6 billion is with a bank syndicate consisting of eight banks, two of which are foreign banks. The term of the loan is five years with annual instalments of NOK 260 million, where the first instalment falls due in September 2012. The financial covenants are as follows:
· Minimum working capital
At the end of each quarter the Group's current assets including unused credit facilities shall be greater than the Group's current debt excluding the first year's instalments on non-current debt.
· Minimum liquidity holding
The Group must maintain unrestricted liquidity of at least NOK 200 million over the term of the loan.
F-106

· Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio/liquidity holding
At the end of each quarter the Group's EBITDA excluding gains/losses on the sale of assets must be equal to or greater than the Group's annual debt obligations and dividend payments, or the Group's unrestricted liquidity including unused credit facilities must be a minimum of NOK 350 million.
· Minimum equity ratio
The Group's equity ratio must be measured on 30 June and 31 December each year, and shall be 22.5 per cent up to 31 December 2014. Thereafter until the expiration of the agreement term the equity ratio requirement will increase to 25 per cent. The convertible bond loan issued by Hurtigruten ASA is regarded as equity in relation to the loan agreement. From 31 December 2012 until 30 June 2013 the equity ratio requirement was temporarily reduced to 20 per cent.
As part of its refinancing Hurtigruten ASA issued an unsecured bond loan of NOK 500 million. The loan has a term of five years and one month and is irredeemable until its final maturity date in April 2017. The financial covenants are as follows:
· Maximum senior debt facilities ratio
The Group's hedged debt shall be less than 65 per cent of the Group's total assets until 30 June 2013. This percentage will be reduced annually by 5 per cent from 1 July 2013. From 1 July 2015 to the expiration of the term of the agreement, hedged debt shall be lower than 50 per cent of total assets.
· Maximum leverage ratio
The Group's interest bearing debt shall be less than 6.5 per cent of the Group's EBITDA, excluding gains/ losses on the sale of assets from 31 December 2012. This percentage shall be reduced annually by 0.5 per cent from 31 December 2013. From 31 December 2012 until 30 September 2013 this requirement was temporarily increased to 12.5 per cent. The requirement for 6.5 per cent also had to be satisfied using normalised EBITDA as a base for the calculation. Normalised EBITDA in this context is the Group's EBITDA adjusted for i) losses arising in connection with the charter arbitration case (cf. notes 2 and 9) and ii) the provision relating to the ESA case (cf. notes 2 and 9).
· Minimum liquidity holding
The Group must maintain unrestricted liquidity of at least NOK 200 million over the term of the loan.
· Minimum working capital
At the end of each quarter the Group's current assets including unused credit facilities shall be greater than the Group's current debt excluding the first year's instalments on non-current debt.
In March 2012 Hurtigruten ASA redeemed the bond loan issued in February/March 2009 pursuant to the loan agreement.
The company also redeemed the convertible bond loan in June 2012 in accordance with the loan agreement.

Note 14 Pensions
Until 31 July 2013 the company operated pension plans that gave entitlement to defined future pension benefits. These were mainly dependent on the number of years of service, salary level upon reaching retirement age, and the size of the National Insurance benefits. These obligations were covered through an insurance company. The defined benefit pension plans covered 1,220 employees in the parent company. For maritime personnel there are three pension plans that covering different pension periods. A defined benefit plan that covers the period from age 60 to 67, and a defined contribution plan through an insurance company that covers pensions after reaching the age of 67. In addition to the pension obligations funded through insurance companies, the company has defined contribution plans for maritime personnel (Norwegian Pension Insurance for Seafarers) which are administrated by the government. All pension plans were transferred to the subsidiary Hurtigruten Sjø AS in connection with the transfer of business that covered all employees in the company. As of 31 December 2013 the company also has an unfunded plan funded from operations.

Restatement of comparative figures
IAS 19, Employee Benefits, has been significantly amended in that the net interest expense is now calculated based on the net deficit measured applying the discount rate to the balance at the start of the year. The effect of this is that the expected return on pension assets in excess of the discount rate for 2012 has been set to zero in the comparative figures. Please refer to note 2B for further information.

Statement on the determination of salary and other remuneration for senior executives in Hurtigruten ASA Guidelines for determining the remuneration of senior executives in Hurtigruten ASA
The following guidelines have been specified with effect from 18 February 2014:

1. Definitions
1.1 Senior executives include the chief executive and other senior executives, cf. Proposition no. 55 (2005­ 2006), which refers to the provisions of the Norwegian Accounting Act and Public Limited Liability Companies Act concerning "senior executives".
1.2 In these guidelines, a compensation scheme means a remuneration package comprising one or more of the following elements: Fixed salary, variable pay (bonuses, share-based programs, options, etc.) and other benefits (pension schemes, pay guarantee schemes, fringe benefits, and the like).
1.3 Severance pay refers here to compensation related to departure from the company and may involve a pay guarantee, other financial benefits and payments in kind.

2. Main principles for determining compensation schemes
2.1 Remuneration to senior executives in Hurtigruten ASA will be competitive but not market leading compared with similar companies.
2.2 The main element in a compensation scheme should be fixed salary.
2.3 Compensation schemes shall be formulated to avoid unreasonable benefits arising as a result of external circumstances which the executive management cannot influence.
2.4 The individual elements in a pay package shall be assessed from an overarching perspective, with fixed salary, possible variable pay and other benefits such as pension schemes and severance pay viewed as a whole. The board of directors shall maintain an overview of the total value of each executive's agreed compensation.
2.5 Determining guidelines for the remuneration of senior executives is the responsibility of the entire board of directors. Remuneration of the group's chief executive is determined by the board of directors.

F-119

2.6 The board of directors shall ensure that remuneration schemes for senior executives do not have unfortunate effects for the company or weaken its reputation.
2.7 Senior executives shall not receive special remuneration for serving as directors of wholly-owned subsidiaries in the same group.
2.8 Agreements entered into before these guidelines came into effect may continue.
3. Variable pay Any variable pay shall be based on the following principles: 3.1 A clear connection shall exist between the underlying goals for the variable pay and the company's
objectives. 3.2 Variable pay shall be based on objective, definable and measurable criteria. 3.3 These criteria shall be based on conditions which the executive in question can influence. 3.4 Several relevant measurable criteria should be applied. 3.5 A variable pay scheme shall be transparent and clearly understandable. Identifying the anticipated and
the maximum payment for each participant in the programme is important when explaining the scheme. 3.6 The scheme shall be of limited duration. 3.7 Total variable pay received in any year should not exceed six months of fixed salary, unless exceptional
circumstances dictate otherwise.
4. Pension schemes 4.1 Pension terms shall be equivalent to those enjoyed by other employees in the company. 4.2 To the extent that a retirement age lower than the National Insurance retirement age of 67 years is
agreed, it should generally not be lower than 65. 4.3 Agreements on pensions shall be based on the same years of pensionable service as for other comparable
employees in the company. 4.4 Pension entitlements earned in other positions shall be taken into account. 4.5 Pension entitlements should not exceed 66 per cent of salary. Retiring at an age younger than 65 shall
result in a lower pension entitlement. 4.6 The board of directors shall obtain an overview of the total cost of a pension agreement before it is
entered into.
5. Severance pay 5.1 Severance pay can be agreed when a senior executive waives their right in advance to the employment
protection provisions in the Norwegian Working Environment Act. Severance pay should not be provided in the event of voluntary resignation except in special circumstances.
5.2 Severance pay should not exceed 12 months fixed salary in addition to possible pay during the period of notice.
5.3 Should the person concerned be appointed to a new position or receive remuneration from an enterprise in which they are an active owner, severance pay should be reduced by a proportionate amount calculated on the basis of the person's new annual income. Such a reduction should first be made after the normal period of notice has expired.
5.4 Severance pay may be suspended if conditions exist which would have justified dismissal or if, during the severance period, irregularities or acts of negligence are discovered which might lead to compensation claims or to criminal charges against the person concerned.

(1) Of the amount that was paid in 2013, NOK 28 million was recognised as an expense during the period 2008­2012.

Hurtigruten ASA entered into contracts in December 2002 and June 2003 to sell and charter back the Hurtigruten ships MS Richard With and MS Nordlys. These ships were sold to Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, respectively, and chartered back for a period of 15 years with an option for an additional 5 years on market terms. For the first 15 years the charter hire payments consist of three components; fixed hire in NOK, fixed hire in USD/EUR and a variable element in USD/EUR. The variable element is linked to variable interest rates, and 6-month Euribor and Libor rates.

Hurtigruten ASA will undertake and pay for the operation, insurance and all necessary ongoing maintenance of the ships. In the charter agreements between the limited partnerships and Hurtigruten ASA, identical requirements (covenants) have been stipulated for Hurtigruten ASA for the term of the agreements, which the company has as a component of its long-term loan agreements linked to the ships. Please see note 10 with regard to these financial covenants.

In connection with the financial restructuring in February 2009, an agreement was reached with the limited partnerships Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, which entailed that the instalment component of the charter hire under the charter-party agreement with the two limited partnerships would not be payable for the period up to 31 December 2011. The postponed instalments would, however, be added to the instalments that were paid in 2012 and 2013, thereby reverting to the original repayment plan from August 2013. An increase in the charter hire was also agreed to compensate for the increased costs incurred by the limited partnerships under their loan agreements because of the changes in the repayment profile. In addition, it has been agreed that Hurtigruten's option to buy back MS Nordlys and MS Richard With should be cancelled. The annual rent and the instalments that accrue in accordance with the agreement are recognised as an expense in the financial statements.

AUDITOR'S REPORT
Report on the financial statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Hurtigruten ASA, comprising the financial statements for the Parent Company and the Group. The financial statements of the Parent Company and the Group comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2012, the statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for the year then ended as well as a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

The Board of Directors' and Chief Executive Officer's responsibility for the financial statements
The Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway for the financial statements of the Parent Company and the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU for the financial statements of the Group, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend or the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements for the Parent Company and the Group.

Note 1 General information
Hurtigruten ASA (the company) and its subsidiaries (together the Group) are engaged in tourism and transport activities in Norway and abroad. The company's core business consists of the Hurtigruten service along the Norwegian coast, with daily calls in 34 ports between Bergen and Kirkenes, and explorer activity in the Polar regions.
The Group's operating segments are organised into the following three product areas: Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast, Explorer products/MS Fram and Spitsbergen. Activities that do not naturally fall within these three segments are bundled in Other business. In 2011 Charter was a separate product area based on the leasing of MS Finnmarken to a company in the Australian oil industry. Following the conclusion of the contract in October 2011, this activity has been included under discontinued operations in Other business in the segment reporting since 2012. The previous year's figures have been re-stated accordingly. These operating segments are reported in the same way as in internal reporting to the board of directors and executive management.
The company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in Norway, with headquarters at Havnegata 2, Narvik. The Group also has offices in Tromsø and Finnsnes, wholly-owned foreign sales companies in Hamburg, London and Paris, a reservations centre in Tallinn as well as activities in Longyearbyen. The company is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.
The Group's presentation currency is NOK.
The consolidated financial statements were approved by the board of directors on 20 March 2013.
Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements
are described below. Unless otherwise stated in the description, these policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented.
2.1 Basic policies The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the EU.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, with the following modifications:
· financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the company's accounting policies. Areas which make extensive use of judgments or involve a high degree of complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are described in more detail in Note 3.
The Group's consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to uniform accounting policies for similar transactions and events under similar conditions.
2.1.1 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures (a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group, which have no effect on the financial statements at this time
The Group made no changes to its accounting policies in 2012. New standards, amendments and interpretations, which were adopted at the 2012 financial year but which had no significant impact on the Group, are described below.
· IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. Amendments affecting the presentation of other comprehensive income, differentiating between items that later will be reversed in profit or loss and items that will not be reversed in profit or loss.
F-133

(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations for existing standards that have not entered into force and which the Group has not early adopted:
The impact of these changes is expected to be:
· IAS 19 Employee Benefits was amended in June 2011. Interest expenses and the expected return on pension assets will be replaced with a net interest amount calculated by applying the discount rate to the net pension obligation (asset). The Group will implement this amendment from 1 January 2013. Other amendments to IAS 19 have already been applied by the Group through existing options already permitted by the standard. Please refer to point 2.23 on pension obligations for further information.
· IFRS 9 Financial Instruments regulates the classification, measurement and accounting of financial assets and liabilities. IFRS 9 was published in November 2009 and October 2010, and replaces those sections of IAS 39 dealing with accounting, classification and measurement of financial instruments. Under IFRS 9, financial assets should be divided into two categories, based on the measurement method: those that are measured at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. A classification assessment is performed upon initial accounting. The classification will depend on the company's business model for managing its financial instruments and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows from the instrument. Requirements for financial liabilities are mainly similar to IAS 39. The main difference, in cases where the fair value of financial liabilities is used, is that the portion of the change in fair value attributable to a change in the company's own credit risk recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income instead of in the income statement, as long as it does not cause an accrual discrepancy in the measurement of profit or loss. The Group plans to apply IFRS 9 when the standard takes effect and has been approved by the EU. The standard takes effect for accounting periods beginning 1 January 2013 or later, but the IASB has distributed for comment a proposal for deferred commencement to accounting periods beginning 1 January 2015 or later.
· IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements is based on current policies regarding the concept of control as the determining factor for whether a company should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. The standard provides extensive instructions for assessing whether or not control exists in difficult cases. The implementation of the standard will not result in any material changes for the Group. The Group has not assessed all of the potential consequences of IFRS 10. The Group is planning to apply the standard to accounting periods beginning 1 January 2013 and later.
· IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interest in Other Entities contains disclosure requirements for economic interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, special purpose entities (SPEs) and other off-balance sheet companies. The Group has not assessed the full impact of IFRS 12. The Group is planning to apply the standard to accounting periods beginning 1 January 2014 and later.
· IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement defines what is meant by the term "fair value" under IFRSs, provides a uniform definition of how fair value should be determined under IFRSs and defines which additional disclosures should be provided when fair value is used. The standard does not extend the scope of accounting to fair value but provides information on its application where use of fair value is already required or permitted under the other IFRSs. The Group uses fair value as a measurement criterion for certain assets and liabilities. The Group has not assessed the full impact of IFRS 13. The Group is planning to apply the standard to accounting periods beginning 1 January 2013 and later.
2.2 Consolidation principles
(a) Subsidiaries and consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are exercisable or convertible at the balance sheet date are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is transferred to the Group and are excluded from consolidation when control ceases.
F-134

The Group also assesses whether control exists in the case of shareholdings of less than 50 per cent of the voting rights, but where the Group is nonetheless in a position to control financial and operational strategies (actual control). Actual control can arise in situations where other voting rights are spread over a large number of owners who are not realistically in a position to co-ordinate their voting. In assessing whether actual control exists the extent to which the Group can influence the composition of the board is critical.
Intragroup transactions, intercompany balances and unrealised intragroup profits and losses are eliminated. If necessary, the subsidiaries' financial statements are revised to achieve consistency with the Group's accounting policies.
Transactions with non-controlling shareholders in subsidiaries are treated as equity transactions. When shares are purchased from non-controlling shareholders, the difference between the consideration and the shares' proportionate book value of the subsidiary's net assets is recorded in equity for the owners of the parent. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling shareholders are also recorded in equity.
When the Group no longer has control, any remaining shareholdings are recognised at fair value, with changes in value recognised in profit or loss. The fair value for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset is cost. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of underlying assets and liabilities. This may entail that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
(b) SPEs
A sale-leaseback solution was carried into effect in 2002 with the Hurtigruten ship MS Richard With, whereby Kystruten KS acquired the ship and leased it back for a 15 year period. Correspondingly, a sale-leaseback solution was carried into effect with the Hurtigruten ship MS Nordlys, whereby Kirberg Shipping KS acquired the ship and leased it back for a 15-year period. On the basis of established contracts, Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS are considered to be SPEs (special purpose entities), which are to be consolidated in the Hurtigruten Group. This has been done by recognising the ship's book value and external liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Previously recognised gains are corrected against equity. The KS's financial statements have been revised to apply the same accounting policies as used by the Hurtigruten Group.
Since 2012 the Group has consolidated a further special purpose entity (SPE). The entity in question is the Group's reservation centre RezCenter OÜ in Tallinn, Estonia. Hurtigruten has no shares in the company, but exercises a controlling influence on the company's financial and operating strategy. Hurtigruten Estonia OÜ and RezCenter OÜ were merged with effect from 1 January 2013. The company is continuing under the name Hurtigruten Estonia OÜ.
2.3 Business combinations
Business combinations are recognised using the acquisition method. The consideration is measured at the fair value of any transferred assets, liabilities or issued equity instruments. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value and is included in the consideration. The contingent consideration is classified as a liability under IAS 39 and recognised at fair value in subsequent periods, with the change of value recognised in profit or loss. In cases where the contingent consideration is classified as equity, fair value measured at the acquisition date remains unchanged. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values on the date of acquisition. Non-controlling interests in the acquired company are measured on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value, or at their proportionate share of the company's net assets.
If the amount of the consideration, the book value of non-controlling interests and the fair value on the date of acquisition of previous equity interests exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired company, the difference is recorded as goodwill, cf. Note 2.8. If the sum is less than the company's net assets, the difference is recognised immediately.
F-135

2.4 Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Significant influence normally exists for investments where the Group owns 20­50 per cent of the voting capital. Investments in associates are initially recognised at cost and subsequently using the equity method. Goodwill is included in the amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of the investment. At the time of reporting, the Group assesses whether there are indications of an impairment of the investment. If there are such indications, the recoverable value of the investment amount is estimated when calculating any impairment loss.
The Group's share of associates' profit or loss is recognised in profit and loss, and is added to the book value of the investments. The Group's share of associates' other comprehensive income is recognised in the Group's other comprehensive income and is also added to the book value of the investments. The Group does not recognise any share of an associate's losses in its income statement if this results in the book value of the investment falling below zero (including unsecured receivables from the entity), unless the Group has assumed liabilities or made payments on behalf of the associate.
The Group's share of unrealised profits on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated. The same applies to unrealised losses, unless the transaction justifies an impairment of the transferred asset. When necessary, the associates' financial statements are revised to achieve consistency with the Group's accounting policies.
Gains and losses with respect to the dilution of ownership in associates are recognised in profit and loss.
When the Group no longer has a significant influence, any remaining shareholdings are recognised at fair value with changes in value recognised in profit and loss. Subsequently, the fair value for subsequent accounting as a financial asset is cost. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect to that entity are accounted for as if the associate had directly disposed of underlying assets and liabilities. This may entail that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. When the Group's shareholding in an associate is reduced, but a significant influence is retained by the Group, a proportional amount of the sum previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit and loss.
2.5 Segment reporting
A operating segment is a part of the business that delivers products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from other operating segments. The Group has three operating segments, called product areas: Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast, Explorer products, and Spitsbergen. Activities that do not naturally fall within these segments are bundled in Other business. The Group's Charter activities relating to the leasing of ships to the oil industry have been discontinued. In 2010 and 2011 this business was reported as a separate operating segment in the Group's segment reporting, but since 1 January 2012 has been classified as a discontinued operation and included in Other business in segment reporting. The comparative figures in the income statement for 2011 have been restated. These operating segments are reported in the same way as internal reporting to the board of directors and executive management.
2.6 Translation of foreign currencies
(a) Functional and presentation currency
The financial statements of the individual entities in the Group are measured in the currency used in the economic area in which the entity primarily operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Norwegian kroner (NOK), which is both the parent company's functional currency and the Group's presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balance sheet items
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using average exchange rates. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
F-136

on the balance sheet date are recognised in the income statement. If the currency position is considered a cash flow hedge, gains and losses are recognised as other comprehensive income.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on loans, cash and cash equivalents are presented (net) in the income statement as financial income or expenses.

(c) Group companies
The income statement and balance sheet of all Group entities (none subject to hyperinflation) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
· The balance sheet is translated at the rate in force at the balance sheet date
· The income statement is translated at the average exchange rate
· Translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and specified separately in equity as a separate item

2.7 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment consist primarily of ships (Hurtigruten ships), land and buildings (hotels, offices and workshops) as well as buses. Property, plant and equipment are recognised at cost less depreciation. Cost includes costs directly associated with the acquisition of the asset. Cost also comprises the gains or losses transferred from other income and expenses at the time of purchase, due to cash flow hedging in foreign currency for purchases of non-current assets.

Subsequent expenses are added to the asset's book value or are recognised separately in the balance sheet (periodic maintenance) when it is probable that any future financial benefits associated with the expense will devolve to the Group, and the expense can be reliably measured. The book value of replaced parts is recognised in the income statement. Other repair and maintenance expenses are recognised in profit and loss in the period in which the expenses are incurred.

Land is not depreciated. Other operating assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, such that the cost is depreciated to residual value over the asset's expected useful life. Expected useful life is determined on the basis of historical figures, as well as the standard lifetimes in the industry. Residual value is calculated on the basis of estimated sales values for operating assets at the end of their expected useful life. Expected useful life is:

Ships Buildings Vehicles Other

12­30 years 25­100 years 5­12 years 3­10 years

The useful life and residual value of operating assets are assessed on every balance sheet date and amended as necessary. When important components of operating assets have different useful lives, these operating assets are recognised as their various components. These components are depreciated separately over each component's useful life. At the end of each accounting period operating assets are assessed for indications of lasting impairment and, in the event of such impairment, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. When the book value of an operating asset is higher than the estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to the recoverable amount.

Gains and losses on disposals are recognised in the income statement under "Other (losses)/gains--net", as the difference between the sales price and the book value.

Received investment grants for hotel construction on Svalbard are recognised using the gross method and recognised in revenue in line with depreciation of the corresponding asset.

2.8 Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill is the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the Group's share of the entity's net identifiable assets at the time of acquisition. Goodwill can also arise on acquisitions where the decision is made to measure non-controlling interests at fair value at the time of acquisition. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is classified as an intangible asset.
Impairment is assessed annually, or more often in the case of events or changes in circumstances that indicate potential impairments. The recoverable amount is estimated for calculating any impairment. Goodwill is written down to the recoverable amount, when this is lower than the book value. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains or losses on the disposal of an entity include the book value of goodwill related to the divested entity.
When assessing the need for impairment of goodwill, it is allocated to the relevant cash-generating units (operating segments). Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the acquisition (Note 2.9).
(b) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are largely directly associated with development costs for computer systems recognised in the balance sheet at cost, if the criteria for capitalisation are met. The criteria for capitalisation are:
· It is technically feasible to complete the development of the software so that it is available for use.
· Management intends to complete the development of the software and take it into use or sell it.
· Probable usage of the asset in the company can be proved.
· Future economic benefits to the company associated with use of the asset can be calculated.
· Adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete the development and take into use or sell the software
· Development costs for the asset can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets are considered to have a limited life span, and are amortised over their expected useful life. Assessments are made at the end of each accounting period to find any indications of impairment of intangible assets. If there are indications of impairment, the intangible assets are written down to their recoverable value when this is lower than the book value. Subsequent expenses for recognised intangible assets are recognised only when they increase the future economic benefits related to this asset. All other costs are expensed during the period in which they are incurred.
Other development expenditures that do not meet the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as they are incurred.
Development expenditures that have already been expensed cannot be recognised as an asset in future periods.
2.9 Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets with indefinite useful life and goodwill are not amortised but are tested annually or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. Depreciated property, plant and equipment and amortised intangible assets are assessed for impairment when there is any indication that the book value may not be recoverable.
The difference between the book value and recoverable amount is recorded as an impairment loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less sales costs and its value in use. In assessing impairments, non-current assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). At each reporting date the possibility of reversing previous impairment of nonfinancial assets (except goodwill) is assessed.
F-138

2.10 Discontinued operations and non-current assets held-for-sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held-for-sale if their book values will be recovered
through sale and not through continued use. This condition is deemed to be fulfilled if a sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its current condition. Management at the relevant level must have made a commitment to complete the sale and the transaction must be expected to be completed within one year of the classification date.
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) that are classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of previous book value and net sale value, and are not depreciated.
A discontinued operation is a segment that has been disposed of or classified as held-for-sale, and which represents a significant area, geographical region, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale.
Net profits or losses after tax for discontinued operations are reported separately in income from continuing operations. Results from the previous period for discontinued operations are reclassified in order to obtain comparable figures. Assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale are presented on separate lines in the balance sheet under current assets and current liabilities respectively. Previous periods are not restated on the balance sheet.
2.11 Financial assets 2.11.1 Classification
The Group classifies financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, as well as loans and receivables. The classification depends on the object of the asset. Management determines the classification of financial assets at initial recognition.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held-for-trading. A financial asset is
classified in this category if it was acquired primarily to provide a profit from short-term price fluctuations. Derivatives are categorised as held-for-trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
(b) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed payments that are not traded in an
active market. They are classified as current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are classified as "trade and other receivables" in the balance sheet (Note 2.16).
2.11.2 Recognition and measurement Regular purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade-date, which is the day the Group
commits to purchase or sell the asset. All financial assets that are not recognised at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets recognised at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investment expire or when these rights have been transferred and the Group has substantially transferred all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial assets recognised at fair value in profit or loss are carried at fair value after initial recognition in the balance sheet. Loans and receivables are carried in successive periods at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
Gains or losses from changes in fair value of assets classified as "financial assets at fair value through profit or loss", including interest income and dividends, are included in the income statement under financial items in the period in which they arise. Dividends from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are included in the income statement when the Group's right to receive payments is established.
F-139

2.12 Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities may only be offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when
there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
2.13 Impairment of financial assets Assets carried at amortised cost
At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the assets (a "loss event") and the impact of that loss event (or events) on estimated future cash flows can be estimated reliably.
The criteria that the Group uses to determine whether there is objective evidence of an impairment loss include:
· Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or debtor · Breach of contract, such as default or delinquency in interest or principal payments · The Group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, granting to the
borrower a concession that the lender would not otherwise consider · It becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial restructuring · The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties · Observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a
portfolio of financial assets since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the portfolio's individual financial assets, including: · Adverse changes in the payment status of the portfolio's borrowers. · National or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the portfolio's assets.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's book value and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The asset's book value is reduced and the amount of the loss recognised in the consolidated income statement.
If the impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the fall in value was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor's credit rating), the previous loss is reversed in the consolidated income statement. Reversal of previous losses must not exceed the expected value, if the impairment had not been made.
Impairment testing of trade receivables is described in Note 2.16.
2.14 Derivatives and hedging Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently re-measured at fair value on an ongoing basis. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group classifies derivatives that are part of a hedging instrument as either:
(i) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair-value hedge) or (ii) hedges with variable cash flows with a particular risk associated with a recognised asset, liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents whether the derivatives that are used in
F-140

hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Such assessments are documented both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis.
The fair values of derivatives used for hedging purposes are presented in Note 11C. Changes in the equity item hedging are presented in Note 16. The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining term of the hedging item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or current liability if the remaining term of the hedging item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as current assets or current liabilities.
Cash flow hedging The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging
instruments in cash flow hedges is recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Losses and profits on the ineffective portion are recognised in the income statement.
Hedge gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are recognised as income or expense in the period during which the hedged item affects the income statement (for example, when the planned sale is taking place). Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate loans are recognised in the income statement under "financial expenses". Gains or losses on the ineffective portion are recognised in the income statement. When the forecast hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (such as inventories or property, plant and equipment), the gains and losses previously recognised within other comprehensive income are transferred to the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in cost of goods sold or in depreciation of property, plant and equipment.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement. When a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
2.15 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-
out (FIFO) method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to sell.
2.16 Trade receivables Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise or services sold in the ordinary course
of business. If settlement is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are classified as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised and presented at the original invoice amount and written down following "loss events" which have an impact on the payment of the receivable that can be reliably estimated. Thus, trade receivables are accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The interest element is disregarded if it is insignificant.
2.17 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, bank deposits and other short-term liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities in the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents are defined differently in the balance sheet and cash flow presentation. Restricted capital is included in the balance sheet presentation but not in the cash flow presentation
2.18 Share capital and premiums Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Expenses directly connected to the issue of new shares or options net of tax are recognised as a reduction in consideration received in equity.
F-141

Where any Group company purchases the company's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable transaction costs (net of taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to owners of the parent until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to owners of the parent.
2.19 Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are classified as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequently, trade payables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The interest element is disregarded if it is insignificant.
2.20 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, borrowings are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings as part of the effective interest.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless there is an unconditional right to defer payment of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
2.21 Compound financial instruments
Compound financial instruments issued by the Group include convertible loans that the owner can convert to share capital, where the number of shares to be issued does not vary with changes in the fair value of the shares. Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, borrowings are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings as part of the effective interest.
The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is recognised initially at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not re-measured subsequent to initial recognition.
2.22 Current and deferred income taxes
The tax expense for a period comprises current and deferred income tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In such case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is calculated in accordance with the tax laws and regulations enacted or substantively enacted on the balance sheet date in the countries where the company's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax laws are subject to interpretation. Based on management's assessment, a provision is made for expected tax payments when necessary.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on all temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their book values in the consolidated financial
F-142

statements. Deferred income tax is not recognised in the balance sheet if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination, which at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and tax laws which have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and which are expected to apply when the deferred income tax asset is realised, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the tax-reducing temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Group makes provisions for uncertain and contested tax positions. This provision is reversed if the contested tax position is decided in favour of the Group and can no longer be appealed.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.23 Pension obligations, bonus plans and other employee benefits
(a) Pension obligations
Group companies operate various pension schemes. The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension scheme under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a separate legal entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the entity does not have sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension scheme that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement. Pension payments are dependent on one or more factors such as age, number of years of service and salary.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised estimate variances and unrecognised past-service costs. The pension liability is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation, alternatively government bond rates if such rates are not available. For Norwegian schemes, corporate bonds, covered bonds at the balance sheet date, are used, with an additional provision taking into account relevant terms to maturity for the pension obligations.
Variances from estimates arising from experience adjustments or changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in equity within other comprehensive income, in the period in which they arise.
Changes in pension scheme benefits are recognised immediately as expenses or income in the income statement, unless rights in the new pension scheme are conditional on the employee remaining in service for a specific period of time (the vesting period). In such case, the costs associated with the change in benefit are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as payroll costs when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as a financial asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
F-143

The Norwegian Parliament adopted a new law on the AFP early retirement scheme in February 2010. The new AFP early retirement scheme is accounted as a benefit-based multi-entity plan. This entails that individual entities account for their proportional share of the plan's pension obligations, assets and costs. Until there is reliable and consistent information for provisions, the new AFP early retirement scheme is recognised as a defined contribution plan.
(b) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are discounted to the present value. A discount rate before tax that reflects the current market situation and is risk-specific for the liability concerned is used. Any increase in the liability as a result of changed time values is recognised as an interest expense.
(c) Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to owners of the parent after certain adjustments. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
2.24 Provisions
Provisions for restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination benefits. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses; however, provisions for unprofitable contracts are recognised.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. Thus a provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. A discount rate before tax that reflects the current market situation and is risk-specific for the obligation concerned is used. Any increase in the obligation as a result of changed time values is recognised as an interest expense.
2.25 Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised at the fair value, net of VAT, returns, discounts, and rejects. Intragroup sales are eliminated.
Sales are recognised when revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and specific criteria related to the various forms of sale that are listed below are met. The Group bases its accounting estimates on historic income, an assessment of the type of customer and transaction concerned, as well as any specific conditions attached to the individual transaction.
Revenues are recognised in the income statement as follows:
(a) Sales of services and travel
Sales of services are recognised in the accounting period when the service is rendered and/or delivered. For ship voyages, this is based on the days the passenger is on board. Revenues related to
F-144

ship voyages are accrued on the basis of the number of days the voyage lasts before and after the end of the accounting period. Prepaid revenues on the balance sheet date are recognised as liabilities. Earned but not invoiced services are recognised in the income statement on the balance sheet date as a receivable.
(b) Sales of goods Sales of goods are recognised when an entity within the Group has sold the product to the customer. The
sale is considered completed when the customer has received the item after payment. Payment for retail transactions is usually made in the form of cash or by credit card. The revenue is recognised in the income statement including the credit card fees incurred for the transaction. The fees are recorded as sales expenses.
(c) Public procurement Revenues received from public procurement are recognised in the income statement on a continuous basis
over the year on the basis of existing contracts. These contracts are primarily based on a tender, where the company has a fixed contract sum for planned (annual) production. There are specific conditions and calculation methods for the indexation of the contract sum. Any changes beyond the planned production are compensated/ deducted utilising agreed-upon rates set out in the agreements, and recognised in the periods in which they occur.
(d) Rental income Rental income is recognised continuously over the year, divided by the number of days/months the tenant
has had the object at their disposal in relation to the agreement.
(e) Interest income Interest income is recognised in accordance with the effective interest method. Should an impairment of
loans and trade receivables be required, the book value is reduced to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is estimated future cash flow discounted by the original effective interest rate. After impairment, interest income is recognised based on the original effective interest rate.
(f) Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
2.26 Leases 2.26.1 The Group as lessee
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
When the Group has substantially assumed all the risks and rewards of ownership, leases are classified as finance leases. Assets secured through finance leases are recognised in the income statement at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payment. The Group employs the implicit interest rate for the lease in its calculations. Direct expenditures related to entering the contract are added to the amount recognised as an asset. Assets are depreciated according to the asset's expected useful life.
Debt to the lessor is recognised in the balance sheet as a finance lease liability. The liability is reduced by lease payments less estimated interest expenses.
F-145

2.26.2 The Group as lessor In 2011 the Group leased out ships on time-charter and bareboat agreements. All of the Group's leasing
agreements for ships are considered a lease of assets and fall under IAS 17 Leases. These leases are considered operating leases based on the structure and term of the agreement.
(a) Time charter The Group leases out ships on time charter (TC). For time charters (supplytime 89), the ship is leased out
with a crew. The lessee determines, within the limitations of the lease, how the ship will be used. The lessor covers operating costs, such as crew, operational supplies, insurance, repairs, and administration, while the lessee covers expenses such as bunker and port fees. In addition to the lease of ships, there are, in some instances, agreements for additional services such as extra crew, sale of provisions and coverage of other operating costs. Revenues from leasing ships on time charters are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease period starts from the time the ship is at the disposal of the lessee and ceases upon the agreed return delivery. Leasing of additional crew and considerations for coverage of other operating costs are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Services supplied in connection with a time charter are recognised in the accounting period when the service is rendered and/or delivered. Please see Note 2.25.
(b) Bareboat In a bareboat agreement, all operational risk rests with the lessee, who is responsible for covering all costs
related to the ship. Revenues from leasing ships on bareboat agreements are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease period starts from the time the ship is at the disposal of the lessee and ceases upon the agreed return delivery.
2.27 Dividends Dividend distribution to owners of the parent is recognised as a liability in the Group's financial statements
when the dividends are approved by the general meeting.
2.28 Government grants Government grants are recognised at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be
received and that the Group will meet the terms of the grant.
2.29 Classification and maintenance costs In connection with docking ships, expenditures and improvements required by the classification will be
capitalised and depreciated over time up to the next class survey/docking. The same applies to costs for class recertification. Periodic maintenance is recognised in the balance sheet and expensed over the period until the next periodic maintenance. The cost of newbuilds and second-hand tonnage is decomposed (Note 2.7), with a portion corresponding to the first periodic maintenance cost recognised in the balance sheet and expensed over the period until the next periodic maintenance. On the disposal of ships, capitalised costs charged to expenses will be classified as part of the gain/loss.
Ongoing maintenance for all ship types is expensed continuously during the period in which the work is performed.
2.30 Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of operating assets are recognised in the balance
sheet until the asset is ready for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed.
2.31 Remuneration based on share prices The Group has remuneration based on share price, structured as synthetic options with cash settlements.
F-146

The fair value of options allocated during the period is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This is done quarterly. Key inputs for calculations are: the share price at allotment date, exercise prices, the standard deviation of expected stock returns and annual risk-free interest rate. Volatility measured using the standard deviation of expected returns is based on statistical analysis of the daily share price for the agreed period.
The fair value is expensed over the vesting period.
On each balance sheet date, the Group reviews its estimates for the number of expected options. The Group recognises any effects of changes to the original estimates in the income statement.
Note 3 Important accounting estimates and judgments Estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on past experience, consultation
with experts, trend analyses and a number of other factors, including forecasted future events that are deemed probable under current circumstances.
3.1 Key accounting estimates and assumptions The Group makes estimates and assumptions about the future. By their very nature, the accounting estimates
that are made as a result of the above processes will therefore rarely fully correspond with the final outcome. Estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the book values of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below.
(a) Estimated impairment of goodwill The Group performs annual tests to assess potential impairment of goodwill, cf. Note 2.8. The estimated
recoverable amount is determined using the present value of budgeted cash flows for the cash-generating units. These calculations require the use of estimates of the required rate of return for the period, cash flows and the growth factor of the cash flows (Note 9).
The Group does not apply a general growth factor beyond expected inflation for cash flows when testing goodwill for impairment. The required rate of return used to discount cash flows is calculated as a weighted average of the return on equity and the required rate of return on interest-bearing debt. This calculation utilises an estimate of the risk-free interest rate, risk premium, beta and the liquidity premium.
(b) Ships Useful economic lifetime
The level of depreciation depends on the estimated economic lifetime of the ships. These estimates are based on history and experience relating to the Group's ships. The estimates are reviewed at regular intervals. A change in the estimate will affect depreciation in future periods.
Estimated impairment of ships Where there are indications of such, the Group tests whether ships have suffered any impairment, cf. Note
2.7. The estimated recoverable amount is determined using the present value of budgeted cash flows for the cashgenerating units. Ships are considered within their segment as a collective cash-generating unit. These calculations require the use of estimates to establish the required rate of return for the period, cash flows and the growth factor of the cash flows (Note 8).
The Group does not use a general growth factor beyond expected inflation for cash flows when testing ships for impairment. The required rate of return used to discount cash flows is calculated as a weighted average of the return on equity and the required rate of return on interest-bearing debt. This calculation utilises an estimate of the risk-free interest rate, risk premium, beta and the liquidity premium.
F-147

(c) Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and to make assumptions based mainly on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. Please refer to Note 11A for further information.
(d) Pension assumptions
The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes. Measurement of pension costs and pension obligations for defined benefit plans involves the application of a number of assumptions and estimates, including the discount rate, future salary levels, expected employee turnover rate, the return on plan assets, annual pension increases, expected adjustments to G (the National Insurance Scheme basic amount) and demographic factors.
The Group has pension obligations in Norway and Germany. The discount rate used to calculate pension obligations in Norway is based on 15-year corporate covered bonds, with an additional provision taking into account relevant terms to maturity for the pension obligations. Covered bonds are primarily issued by credit institutions to listed Norwegian commercial and saving banks and are secured against loans directly owned by the credit institution. Hurtigruten's pension obligations for 2012 relate to Norway. The discount rate applied in Norway at 31 December 2012 was 3.9 per cent, in accordance with guidance from the Norwegian Accounting Standards Board on the determination of pension assumptions at 31 December 2012. For obligations in Germany, the discount rate is determined based on the interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, with terms to maturity approximating to the term of the related pension obligation. The discount rate applied in Germany at 31 December 2012 was 3.1 per cent.
Changes in pension assumptions will affect the pension obligation and pension cost for the period. Pension obligations are significantly affected by changes in the discount rate, life expectancy and expected salary and pension adjustments.
Please refer to Note 19 for more information about pensions.
(e) Income tax
Income tax is calculated based on results in the individual Group companies. The Group is subject to income taxes in several jurisdictions. Calculation of the period's tax expense and distribution of tax payable and deferred income tax for the period requires a discretionary assessment of complex tax regulations in several countries. Consequently, uncertainty attaches to the final tax liability for many transactions and calculations. Where there is a discrepancy between the final tax outcome and the amounts that were initially recognised, this discrepancy will impact the recognised tax expense and provision for deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made. Please refer to Note 18 for more information about income tax.
(f) Deferred income tax assets
The basis for recognising deferred income tax assets is based mainly on the utilisation of tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income in the Group. The assessment is made based on management's estimates of future profits in the Group and includes an assessment of the Group's future strategy, economic developments in the markets in which the Group operates, future tax regimes and the Group's ability to deliver forecast synergies. In preparing the financial statements, management has assessed the future taxable income to be sufficient to utilise the recognised deferred income tax assets. Please refer to Note 18 for more information on deferred income tax assets recognised in the balance sheet.
(g) Disputes, claims and regulatory requirements
The Group is a party to, or affected by disputes, claims and regulatory requirements the outcome of which is to a large extent unknown. Management considers the probability of negative outcomes and opportunities for estimating any loss in the event of such negative outcomes. Unexpected events or changes to factors taken into consideration that have an impact on specific conditions, may result in
F-148

increases or reductions to provisions. Such changes may also necessitate the recognition of provisions for conditions that were previously assessed as an unlikely outcome or for which it was previously not possible to make reliable estimates.
3.2 Key judgments affecting the entity's accounting policies (a) Provision for planned efficiency measures
In connection with the notified efficiency-improvement measures in the onshore organisation, Group management has recognised a provision of NOK 10.3 million in respect of function duplication in downscaling processes and costs relating to the relocation and closing down of offices. A key consideration in assessing the above was the fact that the new structure has been adopted and communicated, giving rise to an existing obligation. The new structure is effective from 31 March 2013. The Group is relocating its headquarters to Tromsø, and current operations in Narvik will gradually be phased out in the period leading up to 30 September 2013. Costs will be incurred in connection with disassembly and removal of equipment from Narvik. A provision has been recognised for voluntary redundancy packages/severance pay for redundant employees. The notice period has been set at three months from 1 April 2013. A further provision has been recognised for salaries of employees who do not wish to transfer to the new workplace, but who will temporarily commute to the new headquarters in order to ensure transfer of expertise to new employees. The provisions also cover salary paid to an external project manager in respect of the efficiency programme.
(b) Discontinued operations In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the Group's activities relating to the chartering of ships to
the oil industry were reported as a separate segment to reflect the fact that this business represented an extensive activity for the Group for a number of years. The segment's final assignment was concluded at the end of 2011 and the activity is now deemed to be discontinued. The business has consequently been classified as a discontinued operation in the annual financial statements in accordance with IFRS 5. Please refer to Note 7 for further information.
Note 4 Financial risk management The Group uses financial instruments such as bank loans and bond loans. In addition, the Group utilises
financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables, etc., that are directly related to day-to-day operations. The Group utilises certain financial derivatives for hedging purposes.
4.1 Financial risk factors The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency, price, fair-
value interest rate and variable interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overarching risk management goal is to increase predictability for the Group's operations and to minimise the impact of fluctuations in macro conditions on the Group's results and financial position.
The Group has defined overarching principles for risk management which encompass guidelines for specific areas such as currency, interest rate and credit risk and the use of financial derivatives. The board of directors approves the Group's risk management strategy and reviews this annually. The CFO function is responsible, in consultation with the CEO, for conducting ongoing tactical risk management in line with the approved strategy, including exposure analyses and reporting.
(a) Market risk
(i) Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk in multiple currencies, in particular, the
euro (EUR), US dollar (USD), and pound sterling (GBP). Currency risk arises from future ticket sales as well as recognised assets or liabilities. In addition, fuel cost is quoted in USD. Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency which is not the entity's functional currency.
F-149

The Group's risk management policy is aimed at securing 60­80 per cent of expected cash flows in EUR for the next one to two years, using transparent and liquid financial derivatives, normally futures contracts combined with options. Hedges have been made on just under 70 per cent of expected cash flows in EUR for 2013. These were mainly entered into during the first quarter of 2013. The company refinanced its debt in March 2012, where portions of the loan can be converted from NOK to EUR to achieve a "natural hedge". This conversion right applies for the entire term of the loan.

The Group was also exposed to currency risk in Australian dollars (AUD) in connection with the leasing of MS Finnmarken as a hotel ship outside Australia in the period 30 April 2010­30 October 2011. Following the conclusion of the contract the Group had some material outstanding claims against the contracting party. Forward hedges were then made corresponding to 50 per cent of exposure in AUD in respect of the above. The currency hedges were settled in connection with settlements with the contracting partner and subsequent payment received by Hurtigruten at the end of 2012.

The price of oil, and thus bunker oil, is internationally traded in USD, while the Group purchases bunker oil in NOK. The risk can therefore be split into a currency element and a product element. The currency element is partially aligned with the Group's cash flow exposure in USD, and the product risk is hedged separately.

Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS are consolidated in accordance with IFRS SIC-12 "Consolidation-- Special Purpose Entities". The two entities have portions of their debt in EUR and USD. The Group is therefore exposed to currency risk when paying interest and converting this debt to NOK. The debt in EUR and USD is partially hedged through the Group's net revenues in these currencies.

The Group has some investments in foreign subsidiaries whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.

The table below shows the Group's sensitivity to potential changes in the exchange rate for NOK against relevant currencies in relation to the exchange rate at 31 December, with all other variables held constant. Changes mainly relate to foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of financial derivatives, borrowings, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and other investments.

The calculations assume that the NOK depreciates by 5 per cent against the relevant currencies. With an equivalent appreciation of the NOK, the amounts would have an equal and opposite value. In 2011 the effect on equity was different to the effect on the income statement due to the fact that currency derivatives are recognised as hedges, while changes in value on these are recognised directly in equity. At 31 December 2012 the Group only held currency options held for trading purposes, meaning that the effect on the income statement and equity of the above are the same.

(ii) Price risk
The Group is exposed to bunker oil price risk and the board of directors has approved a strategy of quarterly rolling hedges of 0­80 per cent of estimated future consumption for one to six future quarters, where the Group hedges a larger share of consumption in the near future and a smaller share further ahead. In addition, the Group has a stop-loss strategy where it attempts to hedge the unhedged amount if the price of oil rises above a predefined threshold. Hedges are made in the forward market on 45 per cent of expected bunker consumption for 2013, distributed with a higher proportion in the coming quarters, and a lower proportion towards the end of the year. Forward hedges have also been made on 12 per cent of expected bunker consumption in the first and second quarter of 2014.

These calculations are based on the average unhedged bunker volume, and indicate how an increase of 20 per cent in bunker prices would have had an impact on the financial statements for 2011 and 2012. The effect on equity is different than the effect on the income statement because these hedging activities fulfil the requirements for hedge accounting and unrealised changes in value are recognised directly in equity.

(iii) Cash flow and fair-value interest rate risk
The Group's interest rate risk is associated with current and non-current borrowings. Loans subject to a variable interest rate present a risk to the Group's overall cash flow. Fixed interest rates expose the Group to fairvalue interest rate risk. Over the course of 2011 and 2012, the Group's loans at variable interest rates were mainly in NOK. A portion of the loans assumed by Kystruten KS (SPE) and Kirberg Shipping KS (SPE) are in EUR and USD.

The Group manages its variable interest rate risk through variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps involve converting loans with variable interest rates to fixed-interest loans. Through interest rate swaps, the Group enters into contracts with other parties to swap the difference between the contract's fixed interest rate and the amount of the variable interest rate calculated on the agreed principal. In connection with the refinancing of the company's long-term debt in March 2012 a new strategy was adopted for hedging interest, under which 40­60 per cent of the Group's total exposure is to be hedged. Non-amortising interest rate swaps have been entered into corresponding to 58 per cent of the Group's total debt on refinancing.

The table below shows the Group's sensitivity to potential changes in interest rate levels, with all other variables held constant. These calculations take all interest-bearing instruments and associated derivatives into consideration.

An increase of 0.5 per cent in the variable interest rate would increase the Group's interest costs by approximately NOK 4.1 million (2011: NOK 11.4 million) after tax. Equity would have been NOK 3.4 million higher (2011: NOK 10.3 million lower) as a result of the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps.

(b) Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk. Sales to end users are settled in cash or with recognised credit cards. Sales to external agents are made either through prepayment/credit cards or through invoicing. The Group has routines to ensure that credit is only extended to agents with a satisfactory credit rating. Individual risk exposure limits are set based on internal and external assessments of credit ratings.
The counterparties to the derivative contracts and cash transactions are limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Group has routines that limit exposure to credit risk relating to individual financial institutions.
At 31 December 2011 a larger share of trade receivables than normal was due but not impaired. This related to non-settled supplementary compensation from the government for the purchase of services under the former coastal service contract, and outstanding claims against the contracting
F-151

party in connection with the winding down of the Group's charter activities in Australia. The Group received just over NOK 300 million in liquidity in December 2012 in connection with these two cases, but at the same time had to recognise a loss for the charter business along with a further provision relating to the supplementary agreement with the government. Hurtigruten no longer has any balance sheet claims relating to the charter business, and the remaining receivable due from the government represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications in connection with the supplementary agreement has been fully written down as a result of the provision. For further details please see Note 5 Contingencies and Note 12 Receivables and other investments.

(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk management includes maintaining a sufficient level of liquid assets geared to operational and investment plans, and ensuring the availability of sufficient funding from committed credit facilities. The Group has a group account that ensures that part of the Group's unrestricted liquidity is available to the parent company, and which also optimises availability and flexibility in liquidity management. The Group's finance function has overall responsibility for managing the Group's liquidity risk. Rolling liquidity forecasts are prepared in order to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquidity reserves to satisfy the Group's obligations and financial loan covenants.

4.2 Risk relating to asset management
The Group's long-term goal for asset management is to ensure continued operations, and thereby secure future dividends for shareholders. Furthermore, the object is to maintain an optimal capital structure, and thereby reduce the Group's capital costs. There has been no significant change in the Group's asset management from 2011 to 2012.
In order to maintain and improve the capital structure, the Group has no plans for declaring dividends or repaying capital to shareholders in the short term. In recent years the Group has prioritised divesting non-core activities. No additional share issues have been planned for the short and medium terms.
The Group monitors capital structure on the basis of, inter alia, the equity ratio. This ratio is calculated as equity divided by total assets and at 31 December 2012 was 22.1 per cent (31 December 2011: 26.0 per cent). The company meets the requirements for equity in the loan agreements (Note 17).

Note 5 Contingencies
At 31 December 2012, the Group had contingent liabilities relating to bank guarantees and other guarantees, in addition to other contingent outcomes in the course of regular operations. No significant liabilities are expected to arise with respect to contingent liabilities with the exception of the provisions that have already been provided for in the financial statements (Note 20).

Membership of the NOx Fund
Hurtigruten ASA is a member of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise's (NHO) Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) Fund. The main objective of the Environmental Agreement concerning reductions of NOx and the NHO's NOx Fund, is to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide. The Fund is a joint venture to which affiliated businesses can apply for support for emission-reducing measures. Payment to the Fund replaces the nitrogen oxide tax for affiliated businesses.
NOK 15.3 million in NOx tax was charged to the annual financial statements for 2012 (2011: NOK 13.4 million). Members of the NOx Fund collectively undertook to reduce their emissions of these gases by 18,000 tonnes in total in the period 2008­2010 through the Environmental Agreement. A new Environmental Agreement relating to NOx for the period 2011­2017 was signed on 14 December 2010. The signatories of the Environmental Agreement for the period 2011­2017 have undertaken to reduce their overall NOx emissions by 16,000 tonnes and to maintain the emission reductions achieved for the entire period. During this period the agreement has annual and biennial targets that are to be met, which can be broken down into 3,000 tonnes in 2011, 2,000 tonnes in 2012, 4,000 tonnes in 2013 and 2014, 4,000 tonnes in 2015 and 2016 and 3,000 tonnes in 2017.
The Norwegian Climate and Pollution Agency will monitor that the Fund reaches its collective targets. If these targets are not met, the members may be required to pay the full amount of the tax on their respective share of the emissions. This requirement will be calculated on the basis of the percentage of the collective target that has not been achieved. The Fund has achieved its targets for the period 2008­2011.
F-153

Supplementary Agreement in connection with the public procurement contract for the Bergen to Kirkenes coastal service
The Norwegian authorities agreed in 2004 on a contract with Hurtigruten ASA for the delivery of transport services along the Norwegian coast from Bergen to Kirkenes for the period 2005­2012. This contract was awarded based on competitive tendering. In October 2008 it was decided to increase the compensation to Hurtigruten ASA for the remaining term of the contract by refunding 90 per cent of the NOx payments, general compensation due to higher costs and allowing a reduction in the number of ships from 11 to 10 in the winter. The Ministry of Transport and Communications had assumed that the additional grant was in line with state aid policies.
In July 2010 the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) decided to formally investigate in order to verify whether the supplementary agreement entered into in 2008 was in accordance with the EEA's rules for state aid. In June 2011 the ESA concluded that the supplementary compensation had not been granted in accordance with the EEA's rules. It was not evident from the conclusion what portion of the supplementary agreement the ESA believed to represent illegal state aid. On 8 October the EFTA Court upheld the ESA's ruling. In the process leading up to the ruling, the ESA clarified its own resolution of June 2011, and established that around NOK 145 million of the grant given constituted illegal state aid.
At 31 December 2012 Hurtigruten had recognised income of NOK 405 million under the supplementary agreement, including the effect of reducing the number of ships in the winter from 11 to 10, and received NOK 262 million of this amount. On grounds of prudence, a provision of NOK 108 million was recognised in the third quarter of 2012 to reflect the ESA's most recent calculation. This was in addition to the provision of NOK 35 million that had been recognised at 31 December 2011. The provision was recorded as a reduction in contractual revenues. Together with the government Hurtigruten will work to reduce the loss.
The previous contract with the government represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications expired on 31 December 2011 after Hurtigruten and the government agreed on a new contract for the Bergen to Kirkenes coastal service for the period 2012­2019 on 13 April 2011. The new contract entered into force on 1 January 2012.
Charter arbitration case
At the start of 2012 Hurtigruten's Australian subsidiary Hurtigruten Pty Ltd initiated arbitration proceedings against a contracting partner concerning an outstanding claim. The claim related to the leasing of MS Finnmarken as a hotel ship in connection with the construction of the Gorgon field off the coast of Australia. The contract was concluded on 30 October 2011. The outstanding claim amounted to NOK 370 million. On grounds of prudence, Hurtigruten recognised provisions totalling NOK 46 million in respect of the above at 31 December 2011.
An agreement was entered into with the contracting partner with regard to payment of the net outstanding amount through arbitration. This provided the Group with a cash inflow of AUD 38 million (around NOK 221 million), but also resulted in the recognition of a further loss provision in the income statement in the amount of AUD 17 million (around NOK 99 million).
Following the reaching of agreement on the case, Hurtigruten no longer has any claims in the balance sheet concerning the Charter business in Australia.
Legal charges against TIRB and Cominor
Legal charges were brought against AS TIRB and its subsidiary Cominor AS by Troms County Council in May 2009. A complaint was filed with the Court of Conciliation in December 2009. Troms County Council claimed that the companies had overcharged for occasional assistance, and for unforeseen and unplanned driving, for a total amount of NOK 25 million, excluding interest.
Nord Troms District Court delivered its ruling in the case on 4 January 2012 and ordered TIRB and Cominor to pay compensation of NOK 16 million to Troms County Council. The companies only recognised a loss for portions of the ruling at 31 December 2011, NOK 8 million, since the companies disputed the financial calculation on which the ruling was based.
F-154

The case was heard before Hålogaland Court of Appeal and a final ruling was made on the case on 26 November 2012. The Court of Appeal set the total damages at NOK 11.7 million. In the fourth quarter compensation was recognised in respect of the ruling in the amount of NOK 7.5 million including interest. Note 6 Segment information (a) Primary reporting format--operating segments (product areas)
The operating segments are identified based on the same reporting as the management and board apply to their evaluations of performance and profitability at a strategic level. The company's chief operating decisionmaker, which is responsible for allocation of resources to and assessment of earnings generated by the operating segments, is defined as the board of directors and executive management. The classification is broken down into the product areas Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast, Explorer Products/MS Fram and Spitsbergen. Business activities that do not naturally fall under these three areas are classified as Other business.

The reporting of segment assets and liabilities is not part of the internal management reporting in the Group. Material assets and monetary items are monitored at Group level, and certain key figures (such as trade receivables) are assessed based on the status of the individual legal entities. Segment assets and liabilities are therefore not presented.

Hurtigruten Norwegian Coast
This product area comprises the company's operation of the Bergen to Kirkenes coastal service in accordance with the contract with the Norwegian government represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. This service is operated using 11 ships with daily calls to 34 ports between Bergen and Kirkenes. Although passenger transport represents the greatest portion of the service, the cargo service is also substantial
Explorer Products/MS Fram
This product area includes the cruise activities in Polar waters--Antarctica, Svalbard, Greenland and cruises between Antarctica and the Arctic. The cruises are operated by MS Fram, which was custom-built to operate in Polar waters.
Spitsbergen
Activities in Svalbard are organised under the Spitsbergen Travel Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hurtigruten ASA. The product area consists of cruise operations, year-round overnight accommodation and adventure products in Svalbard. The company owns and runs two hotels and one guest house, and the adventure products are produced by the company's own employees and local partners.
Other business
The reporting segment other business comprises activities relating to the bus business managed by AS TIRB and the subsidiary Cominor AS. The Group also owns a small portfolio of properties, primarily through its subsidiary HRG Eiendom AS, which is partially leased by the Group and partially leased to external tenants. The reporting segment includes a further smaller business that cannot be readily classified in the other areas.
The Group's Charter activities relating to the leasing of ships to the oil industry have been discontinued. In 2010 and 2011 this business was reported as a separate operating segment in the Group's segment reporting, but since 1 January 2012 has been classified as a discontinued operation and included in Other business in segment reporting. The company's two remaining fast ferries were previously included in "Profit/(loss) before tax from discontinued operations", but are now classified together with continuing operations since they no longer fulfil the requirements to be classified as a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRSs. The comparative figures in the income statement for 2011 have been restated.
Eliminations
Eliminations in 2011 and 2012 consisted primarily of the subsidiary Cominor AS's excursions for Hurtigruten.
(b) Secondary reporting format--geographical segments
Operating revenues cannot be reliably allocated to separate geographical segments. Management's monitoring of geographical segments applies only to portions of the company's revenue and is also to a large degree based on key non-financial indicators (such as the number of cruise nights).
Note 7 Assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations HELD-FOR-SALE
The Group had no assets and associated liabilities classified as held-for-sale at 31 December 2012. At 31 December 2011 the book value and secured liabilities relating to the Group's two remaining fast ferries were classified as held-for-sale. Both ships are still laid up, but no longer satisfy the requirements to be classified as held-for-sale in accordance with IFRSs. Consequently, they have been classified as part of continuing operations since the third quarter of 2012. Nonetheless, the company still intends to sell the ferries.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Profit or loss from discontinued operations includes the Group's Charter business. The Group's activities connected to the leasing of ships to the oil industry were discontinued from 1 January 2012, and subsequently classified as a discontinued operation. In 2010 and 2011 the business was reported as a separate operating segment in the Group's segment reporting; however, since 1 January 2012 it has been included in Other business in the segment reporting. The comparative figures in the income statement for 2011 have been restated.

The result for 2012 is primarily attributable to losses on receivables in the amount of NOK 99 million following settlement with a contracting party, foreign exchange effects and lawyers' fees in connection with the concluded arbitration case.

Indications of potential impairments in ships are assessed each quarter. An impairment test is carried out where indications of impairment are found to exist. The impairment test of the ships used for the Norwegian coastal service and for MS Fram for 2011 revealed the ships' respective recoverable values were higher than their book values, and hence no impairment loss was recognised. The assumptions underlying the impairment test have not changed significantly, and there are no indications of any impairment of the Norwegian coastal service ships or MS Fram
The following impairment losses were recognised in 2012:
· A total impairment loss of NOK 17.7 million was recognised for the fast ferries to reflect their expected net realisable value on completion of the ongoing sales process.
· An impairment loss of NOK 6 million was recognised to write MS Nordstjernen down to fair value in connection with the sale of the ship.
· A new estimate of the insurance settlement resulted in the recognition of a further impairment of damaged assets on MS Nordlys as the result of a fire on board in September 2011, totalling NOK 4.7 million.

Leases
The Group leases premises from the subsidiary HRG Eiendom AS as well as the associate ANS Havnebygningen. The parent company and subsidiaries also have external lease costs relating to premises. The parent company's charter of Hurtigruten ships has been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements (saleleaseback agreement with two limited partnerships). Please see Note 20
F-159

concerning the details of this agreement. Furthermore, the parent company and subsidiaries have external costs related to the leasing of other equipment and means of transport. These are operating leases.

Goodwill has arisen in connection with business acquisitions. Other intangible assets primarily comprise capitalised development expenses related to ICT systems (booking, inventories, etc.) with a limited lifespan. The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over 3­10 years. Amortisation is presented under amortisation in the financial statements.
Impairment losses in 2011 relate to the bus operations (Tromsø office) as a result of the fact that Cominor lost the competitive tender for a new contract in Tromsø and surroundings commencing on 1 February 2012. Loss of the tender will entail lower future earnings.

Goodwill relates to the following cash-generating unit:

Assessment of fair value The level hierarchy used for the measurement of fair value is based on the following categories: · Listed price in an active market for an identical asset or liability (Level 1) · Valuation based on observable factors, either directly (price) or indirectly (derived from prices), other than listed price (used in Level 1) for the asset or liability (Level 2) · Valuation based on factors not obtained from observable markets (unobservable assumptions) (Level 3)

The following table presents the Group's assets and liabilities measured at fair value at 31 December 2012:

The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets is based on the market prices on the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and these prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. The market price used for financial assets is the current bid price, and the price used for financial liabilities is the current asking price. These instruments are included in Level 1 and comprise the fair value of some forward bunker oil contracts and other securities.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by means of various valuation methods. The Group uses various methods and makes assumptions based on the prevailing market conditions on the balance sheet date. If all the significant data inputs that are required to determine the fair value of an instrument are observable data, then the instrument will be included in Level 2. This includes the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange options, interest rate swaps and some forward bunker oil contracts.
The nominal value less impairment for losses incurred on trade receivables and the nominal value of trade payables are assumed to approximate the fair value of the items.
If one or more of the significant data inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument will be included in Level 3.
Special valuation methods that are used to assess financial instruments include:
· Quoted market or trading price for corresponding instruments.
· Fair value of interest rate swap contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flow based on the observable yield curve.
· Fair value of forward contracts in a foreign currency is calculated as the present value of the difference between the agreed forward price and the forward price on the balance sheet date multiplied by the contract volume in a foreign currency. The relevant interest rate on the balance sheet date is used for calculation of the present value.
· Other methods, such as discounted cash flows, are used to determine the fair value of the remaining financial instruments.

(1) The remainder of the cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet is cash

None of the financial assets have been renegotiated during the last financial year.

Note 11C Derivative financial instruments
All derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet, while changes in the fair value are recognised temporarily in the hedging reserve in equity and recognised in the income statement when the hedged cash flow is recognised in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of derivatives held for trading are recognised as finance income or finance expenses.

Fair value is calculated based on the mid-price set by the contract counterparty based on current prices in the market on the reporting date.

Derivatives held for trading purposes are classified as current assets or liabilities. The entire fair value of hedging instruments is classified as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item exceeds 12 months, and as a current asset or current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
No ineffectiveness was recordable for any of the cash flow hedges in 2011 or 2012. All the forecast cash flows that were hedged in 2012 continue to qualify for hedge accounting.

a) Forward foreign exchange contracts
There are no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2012 that qualify for hedge accounting (2011: NOK 465 million).
The forward foreign exchange contracts that were entered into for 2012 matured in the period July­ September, when most of the hedged cash flow was expected to occur. The forward foreign exchange contracts satisfied the requirements for hedge accounting in accordance with IFRSs and the changes in the fair value were recognised in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses on contracts that were recorded in other comprehensive income in 2012 were recognised in income in the same periods in which the hedged transactions affected the profit or loss. Realised gains and losses were allocated to passenger revenues. In 2012 realised gains allocated to passenger revenues amounted to NOK 31.1 million (2011: loss of NOK 0.5 million).

(b) Interest rate swaps
The nominal principal on outstanding interest rate swaps at 31 December 2012 was NOK 2,088 million (2011: NOK 341 million).
At 31 December 2012 the fixed interest rate ranged from 2.71 to 5.31 per cent (2011: from 3.87 to 5.31 per cent). The variable interest rates were NIBOR. Gains and losses on interest rate swaps recognised in other comprehensive income at 31 December 2012 (Note 16), will continuously be reversed in the income statement until the bank borrowings (Note 17) have been repaid. Realised gains or losses are allocated to interest expenses. In 2012 realised losses totalling NOK 19.6 million were allocated to interest expenses (2011: NOK 7.5 million).

c) Oil derivatives
The nominal amount of outstanding forward bunker oil contracts at 31 December 2012 was NOK 163 million (2011: NOK 150 million).
The hedged, highly probable transactions are expected to occur at various dates over the next 12 months. The forward contracts mature monthly. Forward bunker oil contracts satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting under IFRSs and changes in the fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Gains or losses on oil derivatives recognised in other comprehensive income at 31 December 2012 (Note 16), will be recognised in the income statement in the same accounting periods that the hedged transactions affect the profit or loss. Realised gains or losses are allocated to bunker costs. In 2012 realised gains of NOK 5.3 million were allocated to bunker costs (2011: NOK 19.5 million).

At 31 December 2012 trade receivables totalling NOK 53.2 million were overdue after provision for impairment of doubtful receivables (at 31 December 2011: NOK 472.2 million). The reduction is primarily attributable to the discontinuation of the Group's activities in Australia.

The year's loss provision primarily comprises: · A provision of NOK 99 million following the settlement relating to the discontinued Charter business,
which is described in more detail below and in Note 5 · A provision of NOK 108 million relating to the Supplementary Agreement with the Norwegian
government following the ruling by the EFTA Court on the ESA case, cf. Note 5
F-166

Hurtigruten's Australian subsidiary Hurtigruten Pty Ltd has reached a settlement with the contracting party in the arbitration case concerning the outstanding claims in connection with chartering of MS Finnmarken. The settlement was reached in December 2012 and resulted in the write-off of NOK 146 million in confirmed losses. The above write-off included NOK 46 million already recognised at 31 December 2011. Following this agreement Hurtigruten has no further claims on the balance sheet relating to the Charter business in Australia.

The Group primarily borrows at variable interest rates, and interest rate swap contracts (swaps) are used for the portion of the borrowings that are to have a fixed interest rate, as dictated by the Group's hedging policy. For further information on the hedging instruments, see Note 11C (Derivative financial instruments).
The fair value is based on discounting cash flows from borrowings by a discount rate based on the market's expectations of the future variable interest rates or the agreed fixed rate. The discount rate for 2012 ranged from 5.5 to 10.5 per cent (2011: average 5 per cent).
The fair value of current borrowings corresponds to the book value as the effect of the discount is insignificant.

Hurtigruten ASA refinanced its debt in the first quarter of 2012, and the new loan agreement with the banks is dated 7 March 2012. The agreement for a total of NOK 2.6 billion is with a bank syndicate consisting of eight banks, two of which are foreign banks. The term of the loan is five years with annual instalments of NOK 260 million, where the first instalment falls due in September 2012. The financial covenants are as follows:
· Minimum working capital
At the end of each quarter the Group's current assets including unused credit facilities shall be greater than the Group's current liabilities excluding the first year's instalments of long term debt.
· Minimum liquidity
The Group must maintain unrestricted liquidity of at least NOK 200 million over the term of the loan.
· Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio/liquidity
At the end of each quarter the Group's EBITDA excluding gains/losses on the sale of assets must be equal to or greater than the Group's annual debt obligations and dividend payments, or the Group's unrestricted liquidity including unused credit facilities must be a minimum of NOK 350 million.
· Minimum equity ratio
The Group's equity ratio must be measured on 30 June and 31 December each year, and shall be 22.5 per cent up to an including 31 December 2014. From 31 December 2014 until the expiration of the agreement term the equity ratio requirement will increase to 25 per cent. The convertible bond loan issued by Hurtigruten ASA is regarded as equity in relation to the loan agreement. From and including 31 December 2012 until and including 30 June 2013 the equity ratio requirement will be temporarily reduced to 20 per cent.
As part of its refinancing Hurtigruten ASA issued an unsecured bond loan of NOK 500 million. The loan has a term of five years and one month and is irredeemable until its final maturity date in April 2017. The financial covenants are as follows:
· Maximum senior debt facilities ratio
The Group's secured debt shall be less than 65 per cent of the Group's total assets until and including 30 June 2013. This percentage will be reduced annually by 5 per cent from and including 1 July 2013. From and including 1 July 2015 to the expiration of the term of the agreement, secured debt shall be lower than 50 per cent of total assets.
· Maximum leverage ratio
The Group's interest bearing debt shall be less than 6.5 per cent of the Group's EBITDA, excluding gains/ losses on the sale of assets from and including 31 December 2012. This percentage shall be reduced annually by 0.5 per cent from and including 31 December 2013. From and including 31 December 2012 until and including 30 September 2013 this requirement has been temporarily set at 12.5 per cent. The requirement for 6.5 per cent shall also be satisfied using normalised EBITDA as a base for the calculation. Normalised EBITDA in this context is the Group's EBITDA adjusted for i) losses arising in connection with the charter arbitration case (cf. Notes 5 and 12) and ii) the provision relating to the ESA case (cf. Notes 5 and 12).
· Minimum liquidity

The fair value of the debt component and the component related to the equity conversion was determined when the loan was issued. The fair value of the debt component, which is included in the non-current liabilities, is calculated using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible loan. The residual amount, which represents the value of the equity component, is recognised in equity under "Other equity not recognised in the income statement".
The loan's interest expenses are calculated based on the effective interest rate method by using an effective interest rate of 10.0 per cent for the debt component.
In the first quarter of 2011 Hurtigruten ASA made an extraordinary instalment payment on the instalment portion of the bareboat lease to the two limited partnerships Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, from which the company leases two Hurtigruten ships. The extraordinary instalment payment was made through the release of funds that were restricted as security for the charter agreement. These funds were used in their entirety for an extraordinary repayment of borrowings in the two limited partnerships. Kystruten and Kirberg Shipping are recognised in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS SIC-12--Special Purpose Entities. A further extraordinary repayment of debt was made in the parent company in the second quarter of 2011 of NOK 100 million.
In 2012 ordinary instalments payments were made as part of the bareboat lease to the limited partnerships mentioned above, along with deferred repayments in accordance with the agreement entered into with the banks and limited partnerships in February 2009. The agreement specified that no instalment payments should be paid on the loan between March 2009 and December 2011. The postponed instalments will be paid back on a pro rata basis together with the instalments due for payment from February 2012 to February 2013.

The deferred income tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards are recognised on the balance sheet to the extent that the Group can utilise the tax loss carryforward against future taxable income. The Group has significant tax-increasing temporary differences relating to the same tax authority as the tax loss carryforward. In preparing the annual financial statements management has found that the future taxable income is adequate to utilise the recognised deferred income tax asset. This assessment is based on a conservative estimate of the Group's future profits, where management attached particular importance to the Group's procurement contract with the government which runs until 2019, as well as the effects of the Group's completed, and planned, restructuring measures. On grounds of prudence the Group has elected not to recognise the deferred income tax asset relating to the tax loss for the year. Tax loss carryforwards may be carried forward for an indefinite period in Norway. The tax loss carryforward at 31 December 2012 was NOK 2,836 million (2011: NOK 2,591 million).

Deferred income tax liabilities recognised directly through equity during the year are as follows:

Note 19 Pensions
The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. For the defined contribution plans the cost is equal to the contributions to the employees' pension savings during the period. The future pensions are dependent on the size of the contributions and the return on the pension plan. For the defined benefit plans, the employer is responsible for paying the agreed pension to the employee based on his/her final salary. Future defined benefits are mainly dependent on the number of contribution years, salary level upon reaching retirement age and the size of the National Insurance benefits. These obligations are covered through an insurance company. In addition to the pension obligations that are covered through insurance schemes, the company has unfunded pension obligations that are funded from revenue, primarily for former key management personnel.
The new Contractual Early Retirement (AFP) Scheme Act adopted by the Storting in 2010 entailed the derecognition of provisions related to the old contractual early retirement scheme and recognition in the income statement. Provisions were set aside to cover the assumed underfunding of the old contractual early retirement scheme. The new contractual early retirement scheme is regarded as a benefit-based multi-entity plan in the financial statements. This means that each individual company shall account for its proportional share of the scheme's pension obligations, plan assets and pension costs. Until reliable and consistent information is available for allocation, the new contractual early retirement scheme will be accounted for as a defined contribution plan.
The established pension plans cover 1,789 employees in the Group. The pension costs for the period illustrate the agreed future pensions earned by employees in the financial year.

Estimate deviation
The discount rate used to calculate the pension obligations for the Group's Norwegian companies was previously based on the 10-year Norwegian government bond interest rate. In light of the Norwegian Accounting Standards Board's declaration that due to changes in the Norwegian financial markets in recent years calculation of the discount rate can now be based on covered Norwegian bonds, in 2012 the Group has opted to calculate the discount rate based on the above covered bonds. The change in calculation basis from using the government bond rate to using covered bonds represents an estimate deviation that has reduced the value of the recognised pension obligation by NOK 61 million.

Deferred revenue recognition A line-by-line recognition has been carried out with respect to the investment contribution received,
including a possible repayment obligation. Revenue recognition of the investment contribution occurs in conjunction with depreciation of the associated asset. This year's recognised revenue is NOK 167,000. The remainder of the investment contribution at 31 December 2012 amounts to NOK 5.3 million.
Restructuring A provision has been recognised for costs relating to function duplication and the closing and relocation of
offices in connection with the adopted efficiency-improvement programme covering the onshore organisation in Hurtigruten Pluss AS.
Legal disputes Legal charges were brought against AS TIRB and its subsidiary Cominor AS by Troms County Council in
May 2009. A complaint was filed with the Court of Conciliation in December 2009. Troms County Council claimed that the companies had overcharged for occasional assistance, and for unforeseen and unplanned driving, for a total amount of NOK 25 million, excluding interest. The Hålogaland Court of Appeal delivered its ruling in the case on 26 November 2012 and ordered TIRB and Cominor to pay compensation of NOK 11.7 million to Troms County Council. The ruling will not be appealed.
Share-value-based remuneration (synthetic options) In 2010 the company established a share-based option scheme for all permanent employees of Hurtigruten
ASA and wholly owned subsidiaries who owned shares in Hurtigruten ASA at 31 December 2010. This is a share-value-based remuneration programme in which the employees receive cash instead of shares (synthetic options). Please refer to Note 21 for further details.
Investment obligations The company has no contractual investments at the balance sheet date.
Operating lease commitments--Group company as lessee The Group leases an office in Tromsø, in addition to some other offices. These leases have varying payment
dates, price adjustment clauses and renewal rights. The Group also leases machinery and transport equipment. Leasing costs for the year are specified in Note 8. The Group has no non-cancellable leases.
The parent company entered into contracts in December 2002 and June 2003 to sell and charter back the Hurtigruten ships MS Richard With and MS Nordlys. These ships were sold to Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, respectively, and chartered back for a period of 15 years with an option for an additional 5 years on market terms. For the first 15 years the charter hire payments consist of three components; fixed hire in NOK, fixed hire in USD/EUR and a variable element in USD/EUR.
Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS are consolidated in accordance with IFRS SIC-12--Special Purpose Entities in the consolidated financial statements. Recognised bareboat charter hire payments in the income statement of the parent company have thus been eliminated against charter hire income in the limited partnerships on consolidation.
F-180

Hurtigruten ASA will undertake and pay for the operation, insurance and all necessary ongoing maintenance of the ships. In the charter agreements between the limited partnerships and Hurtigruten ASA, identical requirements (financial covenants) have been stipulated for Hurtigruten ASA for the term of the agreements, which the company has as a component of its long-term loan agreements linked to ships. Please see Note 17 with regard to these financial covenants.
A breach of the financial covenants may entail a termination of the charter agreements by the lessor. The Group has satisfied all the financial covenants at 31 December 2012.
In connection with the financial restructuring in February 2009, an agreement was reached with the limited partnerships Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, which entailed that the instalment component of the charter hire under the charter-party agreement with the two limited partnerships would not be payable for the period up to 31 December 2011. The postponed instalments would, however, be added to the instalments that were paid in 2012 and will be paid 2013, thereby reverting to the original repayment plan in August 2013. An increase in the charter hire was also agreed to compensate for the increased costs incurred by the limited partnerships under their loan agreements because of the changes in the repayment profile. In addition, it has been agreed that Hurtigruten's option to buy back MS Nordlys and MS Richard With will be cancelled. In the first quarter of 2011 Hurtigruten ASA made an extraordinary instalment payment on the bareboat charter hire. The extraordinary instalment payment was made through the release of funds that were restricted as security for the leases. The payments were used in their entirety for an extraordinary instalment payment of borrowings in the two limited partnerships.

Note 21 Share-value-based remuneration
Hurtigruten would like to encourage its employees to invest in their own company through an incentive scheme. The purpose of this scheme is to make Hurtigruten a more attractive place to work in the long term and raise awareness of shareholder value and profitability, as well as encourage behaviour that will increase shareholder value in the company over time. An option scheme was offered to all the permanent employees of Hurtigruten ASA and wholly owned subsidiaries who owned shares in Hurtigruten ASA at 31 December 2010.
For each share the employee owned on 31 December 2010, the employee received three options. The executive management and personnel reporting directly to the CEO may participate with up to 83,333 shares (for a total of 250,000 share options), employees who report directly to a member of the executive management can participate with up to 33,333 shares (for a total of 100,000 share options) and all other employees can participate with up to 8,333 shares (for a total of 25,000 share options).
The programme is structured as a synthetic share option programme, in which the options can be exercised over the next three years. In December 2011, 20 per cent of the options can be exercised; in December 2012, 30 per cent of the options can be exercised; and, in December 2013, 50 per cent of the options can be exercised. The market price will be the average market price in December for the respective years. The average market price for the second half of 2010, which was NOK 4.01, will be used as the basis for calculating gains. The number of shares held on 31 December 2010 must be kept until the options are exercised. Any gains will be distributed as an extraordinary bonus without any right to holiday pay after the end of each year. The employees will pay ordinary income tax on the gain.

After this period the fair value of the allotted options, calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was NOK 0.19 per option (2011: NOK 1.49 per option). The most important input data includes the share price at 31 December 2012 of NOK 3.00 (at 31 December 2011: NOK 3.03), the exercise prices shown above, a standard deviation of the expected share return of 33 per cent (2011: 59 per cent) and an annual risk-free interest rate of 1.49 per cent (2011: 1.31 per cent). Volatility is measured using the standard deviation of the expected return based on a statistical analysis of the daily share prices in 2012.
The fair value is recognised as an expense under payroll costs over the vesting period. A total of NOK 0.2 million was recognised as an expense in 2012 (2011: NOK 0.3 million). The average price in December each year will be measured against the average price for the second the half of 2010, which was NOK 4.01. The average rate in December 2012 was NOK 3.07 (2011: NOK 3.13), meaning that there was no gains calculation or payment for 2012.

(1) Rood's salary is partially paid in USD and translated to NOK. (2) Fees exclusive of Value Added Tax. (3) Salaries and other remuneration are paid from the management company Hurtigruten Pluss AS, except the employee representatives'
salaries and board fees, which are paid by Hurtigruten ASA. (4) Including the estimated cost associated with the share-based remuneration scheme.

The company's CEO receives an annual salary of NOK 2.8 million. Other benefits include fixed car remuneration and an ordinary telephone, Internet, newspaper and home PC allowance.

The CEO also has a time-limited agreement on a performance-related bonus linked to the operating result before depreciation and amortisation, where performance is indexed against the adjusted operating result before depreciation and amortisation for 2012. The bonus agreement confers the right to a maximum of two bonus payments of up to a total of NOK 7.5 million in addition to holiday pay. The agreement expires in 2015. The payment of the bonus is contingent on the CEO still being in office at the end of the year to which the bonus relates.

The CEO is included in the company's ordinary defined contribution pension scheme for salaries up to 12G and the defined contribution scheme that provides a pension basis for salaries over 12G. The CEO's conditions of employment do not include any personal pension obligations.

F-184

An option agreement has been entered into that grants the CEO the right to acquire up to three million shares. The options may not be exercised for fewer than one million shares at a time. From the time of publication of the figures for the fourth quarter of 2013 and for a period of two months thereafter, or from the time of publication of the figures for the fourth quarter of 2014 and for a period of two months thereafter, the CEO has the right to subscribe to a million shares at a subscription price of NOK 4 per share. From the time of publication of the figures for the fourth quarter of 2014 and for a period of two months thereafter, or from the time of publication of the figures for the fourth quarter of 2015 and for a period of two months thereafter, the CEO has the right to subscribe to a million shares at a subscription price of NOK 5 per share. From the time of publication of the figures for the fourth quarter of 2015 and for a period of two months thereafter, or from the time of publication of the figures for the fourth quarter of 2016 and for a period of two months thereafter, the CEO has the right to subscribe to a million shares at a subscription price of NOK 6 per share. Options that are not exercised within the exercise period lapse without compensation. If an individual shareholder or several collaborating shareholders together should own more than fifty per cent of the shares in Hurtigruten ASA. the CEO has the right to exercise all options within three months from publication of the mandatory notification.
The company's executive management are members of the company's collective defined contribution plan. In addition, a supplementary pension plan has been established, which provides a pension for any salary in excess of 12 times the National Insurance basic amount (12G). The scheme applies to the whole company and covers all employees with salaries over 12G, including members of the executive management and the CEO. The pension costs for the executive management have been included under pension costs above.
The board agreed at a board meeting on 26 February 2008 to introduce a performance-based bonus scheme for the company's executive management with effect from 1 January 2008. The bonus payments are limited to one-third of each executive's annual salary, with 25 per cent of the bonus being determined by the Group's overall results, and the remaining 75 per cent being determined by the results achieved in the executive's area of responsibility. Results within the executive's area of responsibility are compared with predefined targets/ parameters. The bonus scheme includes the executive management with the exception of the CEO. The CEO has a separate performance-related bonus scheme as described above. The executive management has waived its right to bonuses based on the 2012 financial statements.
In 2010 a share-value-based bonus scheme (synthetic options) was established for permanent employees of Hurtigruten ASA and wholly owned subsidiaries. The estimated costs for the year related to senior management covered by the plan are included under other remuneration above. Please see Note 21 for further details on the scheme.

Accounting policies
Hurtigruten ASA has chosen to adopt simplified International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in its parent company accounts, pursuant to section 3­9, paragraph 5 of the Norwegian Accounting Act, cf. regulation of 21 January 2008.
Applying the simplified version of IFRS to the parent company accounts means that valuation rules and accounting policies applied in the consolidated accounts also apply to the parent company, Hurtigruten ASA. See the group accounting policies for further information. A simplified application of IFRS enables the financial statements and note information to accord with the Norwegian Accounting Act (NGAAP). The financial statements and notes for the parent company have been organised in accordance with the NGAAP, with the exception of the comprehensive income statement which follows IFRS.
Shares in subsidiaries and associates are recorded in accordance with the cost method of accounting in the parent company accounts.
Note 1 Financial market risk
The company uses financial instruments such as bank loans and bond loans. In addition, the company has financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables, etc., which are directly linked to day-to-day operations. For hedging purposes the company makes use of certain financial derivatives.
As a result of its regular operations, the company is exposed to risks related, for example, to fluctuations in exchange and interest rates and bunker oil costs. Hurtigruten's overarching hedging strategy is to create predictability for the company's operations and reduce the impact volatility in macroeconomic conditions might have on the company's financial performance and standing. The primary management parameter is the expected cash flow. Extensive use is made of simple, transparent and liquid hedging instruments, mainly forward contracts, combined possibly with options.
Currency risk
The company operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk in multiple foreign currencies, in particular, the euro (EUR), US dollar (USD) and pound sterling (GBP). The currency risk arises from future ticket sales as well as assets and liabilities recognised on the balance sheet. In addition, the bunker oil cost is quoted in USD. A currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency.
The company's strategy is to hedge 60­80 per cent of the expected cash flow in EUR one to two years into the future through the use of transparent and liquid instruments, usually forward contracts combined with options. Hedges have been made on just under 70 per cent of expected cash flows in EUR for 2013. These were mainly entered into in the first quarter of 2013. The company refinanced its debt in March 2012, where portions of the loan can be converted from NOK to EUR to achieve a "natural hedge". The conversion right applies for the entire term of the loan.
The company was also exposed to currency risk in Australian dollars (AUD) in connection with the leasing of MS Finnmarken as a hotel ship off the Australian coast in the period 30 April 2010­30 October 2011. Following the conclusion of the contract, the company had material outstanding claims against a subsidiary, which in turn had outstanding claims against the contracting party. Forward hedges was made corresponding to 50 per cent of exposure in AUD in respect of the above. The currency hedges were settled in connection with settlement reached with the contracting partner and subsequent payment received by Hurtigruten at the end of 2012.
Forward foreign exchange contracts
There are no outstanding forward foreign currency contracts at 31 December 2012 that qualify for hedge accounting (2011: NOK 465 million).
F-194

The forward foreign exchange contracts that were entered into for 2012 matured in the period July­ September, when most of the hedged cash flow was expected to occur. The forward foreign exchange contracts satisfied the requirements for hedge accounting in accordance with IFRSs and the changes in the fair value were recognised in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses on contracts that were recorded in other comprehensive income in 2012 were recognised in income in the same periods in which the hedged transactions affected the profit or loss. Realised gains and losses were allocated to passenger revenues. In 2012 realised gains allocated to passenger revenues amounted to NOK 31.1 million (2011: loss of NOK 0.5 million).
Interest rate risk
The company's interest rate risk is associated with current and non-current borrowings. Borrowings at variable interest rates entail an interest rate risk for the company's cash flow. Fixed interest rate borrowings expose the company to a fair-value interest rate risk. In 2011 and 2012 the company's borrowings with variable interest rates were in NOK.
The company manages the variable interest rate risk by means of variable-to-fixed-interest rate swap contracts. Interest rate swap contracts entail a conversion of variable interest rate borrowings to fixed interest rate borrowings. The company enters into a contract with other parties to exchange the difference between the contract's fixed interest rate and the amount of the variable interest rate calculated on the agreed principal through the interest rate swaps. A new strategy was adopted for hedging interest rates in connection with the refinancing of the company's non-current debt in March 2012, under which 40­60 per cent of the company's total debt is to be hedged. Non-amortising interest rate swaps have been entered into equivalent to 56.5 per cent of the company's debt on refinancing. Including an existing interest-swap agreement with maturity at the end of 2013, just under 69 per cent of the company's total debt was hedged at 31 December 2012.
Interest rate swaps
The nominal principal on outstanding interest rate swaps at 31 December 2012 was NOK 2,050 million (2011: NOK 300 million).
At 31 December 2012 the fixed interest rate ranged from 2.71 to 5.31 per cent (2011: 5.31 per cent). The variable interest rates were NIBOR. Gains and losses on interest rate swaps recognised in other comprehensive income at 31 December 2012 will continuously be reversed in the income statement until the bank borrowings (Note 10) have been repaid. Realised gains and losses are allocated to interest expenses. In 2012 realised losses totalling NOK 19.6 million were allocated to interest expenses (2011: NOK 7.5 million).
Bunker oil
The company is exposed to fluctuations in bunker oil prices. The price of oil, and thus bunker oil, is determined in international trading in USD, while the parent company purchases bunker oil in NOK. The risk can therefore be split into a currency element and a product element. In its risk management strategy, the company has emphasised the need to coordinate risk, and has therefore chosen to reduce the bunkers risk while the currency risk is coordinated with the company's other currency exposures.
The company enters into revolving quarterly forward contracts for the next one to six quarters to hedge 0­80 per cent of the expected bunker oil consumption, with a greater share being hedged in the near future and less being hedged further into the future. In addition, the company has a stop-loss strategy where it attempts to hedge the unhedged amount if the price of oil rises above a predefined threshold. Hedges are made in the forward market on 45 per cent of expected bunker consumption for 2013, distributed with a higher proportion in the coming quarters, and a lower proportion towards the end of the year. Forward hedges have also been made on 12 per cent of expected bunker consumption in the first and second quarter of 2014.
Oil derivatives
The nominal amount of outstanding forward bunker oil contracts at 31 December 2012 was NOK 168 million (2011: NOK 150 million).
F-195

The hedged, highly probable transactions denominated in a foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates over the next 12 months. The forward contracts mature monthly. Forward bunker oil contracts satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting under IFRSs and changes in the fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Gains or losses on oil derivatives recognised in other comprehensive income at 31 December 2012 will be recognised in the income statement in the same accounting periods that the hedged transactions affect the profit or loss. Realised gains and losses are allocated to bunker costs. In 2012 realised gains of NOK 5.3 million were allocated to bunker costs (2011: NOK 19.5 million).
Credit risk and liquidity risk
The company is exposed to credit and liquidity risks. The company has no significant concentration of credit risk. Sales to end users are settled in cash or with recognised credit cards. Sales to external agents occur either through prepayment/credit cards or through invoicing. The company has routines to ensure that credit is only extended to agents with a satisfactory credit rating. Individual risk exposure limits are set based on internal and external assessments of credit ratings.
The counterparties to the derivative contracts and cash transactions are limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings. The company has routines that limit exposure to credit risk related to a single financial institution.
At 31 December 2011 a larger share of trade receivables than normal was due but not impaired. This was due to the fact that additional compensation received from the Norwegian government for the purchase of services under the previous coastal service contract had not been settled pending a decision on an EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) inquiry as to whether the additional compensation from the government contravened EU rules on state aid. The company also had outstanding claims against a subsidiary, which in turn had outstanding claims against a contracting party in connection with the discontinuation of the Group's charter business in Australia. The Group's liquidity was boosted by just over NOK 300 million in December 2012 as a result of settlements in these two cases; however, the Group also had to recognise further loss provisions. The Group no longer has any claims on the balance sheet regarding the charter business, but the parent company still has a receivable due from the subsidiary Hurtigruten Pty. Ltd. The residual receivable due from the Norwegian government represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications relating to the supplementary agreement has been fully written down as a result of the loss provision. These matters are discussed in further detail in Note 2 Contingencies and in Note 9 Combined items.
The company's strategy with regard to liquidity is to have sufficient cash, cash equivalents or credit facilities to finance its ongoing operations and investments. The Group has a group account that ensures that some of the Group's unrestricted liquidity is available to the parent company.
Note 2 Contingencies
At 31 December 2012 the company had contingent liabilities relating to bank guarantees and other guarantees, in addition to other contingent liabilities in the course of regular operations. No significant liabilities are expected to arise with respect to contingent liabilities, with the exception of the provisions that have already been recognised in the financial statements (cf. Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements).
Membership of the NOx Fund
Hurtigruten ASA is a member of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise's (NHO) Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) Fund. The main objective of the Environmental Agreement concerning reductions of NOx and the NHO's NOx Fund, is to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide. The Fund is a joint venture to which affiliated businesses can apply for support for emission-reducing measures. Payment to the Fund replaces the nitrogen oxide tax for affiliated businesses.
NOK 15.3 million in NOx tax was charged to the annual financial statements for 2012 (2011: NOK 13.4 million). Members of the NOx Fund collectively undertook to reduce their emissions of these gases by 18,000 tonnes in total in the period 2008­2010 through the Environmental Agreement. A new environmental agreement relating to NOx for the period 2011­2017 was signed on 14 December 2010.
F-196

The signatories of the Environmental Agreement for the period 2011­2017 have undertaken to reduce their overall NOx emissions by 16,000 tonnes and to maintain the emission reductions achieved for the entire period. During this period the agreement has annual and biennial targets that are to be met, which can be broken down into 3,000 tonnes in 2011, 2,000 tonnes in 2012, 4,000 tonnes in 2013 and 2014, 4,000 tonnes in 2015 and 2016 and 3,000 tonnes in 2017.
The Norwegian Climate and Pollution Agency will monitor that the Fund reaches its collective targets. If these targets are not met, the members may be required to pay the full amount of the tax on their respective share of the emissions. This requirement will be calculated on the basis of the percentage of the collective target that has not been achieved. The Fund has achieved its targets for the period 2008­2011.
Supplementary Agreement in connection with the public procurement contract for the Bergen to Kirkenes coastal service
The Norwegian authorities agreed in 2004 on a contract with Hurtigruten ASA for the delivery of transport services along the Norwegian coast from Bergen to Kirkenes for the period 2005­2012. This contract was awarded based on competitive tendering. In October 2008 it was decided to increase the compensation to Hurtigruten ASA for the remaining term of the contract by refunding 90 per cent of the NOx payments, general compensation due to higher costs and allowing a reduction in the number of ships from 11 to 10 in the winter. The Ministry of Transport and Communications had assumed that the additional grant was in line with state aid policies.
In July 2010 the ESA decided to formally investigate in order to verify whether the supplementary agreement entered into in 2008 was in accordance with the EEA's rules for state aid. In June 2011 the ESA concluded that the supplementary compensation had not been granted in accordance with the EEA's rules. It was not evident from the conclusion what portion of the supplementary agreement the ESA believed to represent illegal state aid. On 8 October the EFTA Court upheld the ESA's ruling. In the process leading up to the ruling, the ESA clarified its own resolution of June 2011, and established that around NOK 145 million of the grant given constituted illegal state support.
At 31 December 2012 Hurtigruten had recognised income of NOK 405 million under the supplementary agreement, including the effect of reducing the number of ships in the winter from 11 to 10, and received NOK 262 million of this amount. On grounds of prudence, a provision of NOK 108 million was recognised in the third quarter of 2012 to reflect the ESA's most recent calculation. This was in addition to the provision of NOK 35 million that had been recognised at 31 December 2011. The provision was recorded as a reduction in contractual revenues. Together with the government Hurtigruten will work to reduce the loss.
The previous contract with the government represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications expired on 31 December 2011 after Hurtigruten and the government agreed on a new contract for the Bergen to Kirkenes coastal service for the period 2012­2019 on 13 April 2011. The new contract entered into force on 1 January 2012.
Charter arbitration case At the start of 2012 Hurtigruten's Australian subsidiary Hurtigruten Pty Ltd initiated arbitration proceedings
against a contracting partner concerning an outstanding claim. The claim related to the leasing of MS Finnmarken as a hotel ship in connection with the construction of the Gorgon field off the coast of Australia. The contract was concluded on 30 October 2011. On grounds of prudence, Hurtigruten recognised provisions totalling NOK 46 million in respect of the above at 31 December 2011.
An agreement was entered into with the contracting partner with regard to payment of the net outstanding amount through arbitration. This provided the Group with a cash inflow of around NOK 221 million in December 2012, but also resulted in recognition of a further loss provision in the income statement in the amount of NOK 99 million.

Intangible assets consist of internal/external development/adaptation of ICT systems and software related to the ships.

The following impairment losses were recognised in 2012:
· A total impairment loss of NOK 17.7 million was recognised for the fast ferries to reflect their expected net realisable value on completion of the ongoing sales process.
· An impairment loss of NOK 6 million was recognised to write MS Nordstjernen down to fair value in connection with the sale of the ship.

Note 4 Assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations
HELD-FOR-SALE
The company had no assets or associated liabilities classified as held-for-sale at 31 December 2012. At 31 December 2011 the book value and secured debt relating to the company's two remaining fast ferries were classified as held-for-sale. Both ships are still laid up, but no longer satisfy the requirements to be classified as held-for-sale in accordance with IFRSs. Consequently, they have been classified as part of continuing operations since the third quarter of 2012. Nonetheless, the company still intends to sell the ferries.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The profit or loss from discontinued operations includes the company's charter activities. The Group's activities connected to the leasing of ships to the oil industry were discontinued from 1 January 2012, and subsequently classified as a discontinued operation. In 2010 and 2011 the business was reported as a separate operating segment in the Group's segment reporting; however, since 1 January 2012 it has been included in Other business in the segment reporting. The comparative figures in the income statement for 2011 have been restated.

In preparing the financial statements, management has found the future taxable income to be sufficient to utilise the recognised deferred income tax assets. This view is based on management's estimates of future profits generated by the company, where particular importance has been attached to the company's procurement contract with the government which runs until 2019, as well as the effects of the company's completed, and planned, restructuring measures. On grounds of prudence, the company has decided not to recognise the deferred income tax asset relating to the loss for the year. There is no restriction on the time tax losses may be carried forward.

Note 8B Creditworthiness of financial assets

Hurtigruten does not have a system that distinguishes between trade receivables and other receivables based on the counterparty's creditworthiness. Hurtigruten has long-standing partners, and it follows up their creditworthiness through periodic reconciliation of the trade receivables ledger and credit monitoring.

Receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to NOK at the rate in effect on the balance sheet date.
The company's provisions for bad debts have increased from NOK 143 million at 31 December 2011 to NOK 347 million at 31 December 2012. The increase is primarily attributable to two factors:
· Hurtigruten's Australian subsidiary Hurtigruten Pty. Ltd. reached a settlement in the arbitration case concerning outstanding claims in connection with the chartering of MS Finnmarken. The
F-202

settlement was made in 2012 and resulted in the recognition of a further loss provision of NOK 99 million, in addition to the provision of NOK 46 million that had already been recognised at 31 December 2011.
· The EFTA Court's ruling in the ESA case relating to the supplementary agreement with the government (from 2008) resulted in the recognition of loss provisions for contractual revenues in the amount of NOK 108 million.
The reduction in the first-year instalments is attributable to the fact that the company refinanced its debt in March 2012.

Hurtigruten ASA refinanced its debt in the first quarter of 2012, and the new loan agreement with the banks is dated 7 March 2012. The agreement for a total of NOK 2.6 billion is with a bank syndicate consisting of eight banks, two of which are foreign banks. The term of the loan is five years with annual instalments of NOK 260 million, where the first instalment falls due in September 2012. The financial covenants are as follows:
· Minimum working capital
At the end of each quarter the Group's current assets including unused credit facilities shall be greater than the Group's current liabilities excluding the first year's instalments of long term debt.
· Minimum liquidity
The Group must maintain unrestricted liquidity of at least NOK 200 million over the term of the loan.
· Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio/liquidity
At the end of each quarter the Group's EBITDA excluding gains/losses on the sale of assets must be equal to or greater than the Group's annual debt obligations and dividend payments, or the Group's unrestricted liquidity including unused credit facilities must be a minimum of NOK 350 million.

F-203

· Minimum equity ratio
The Group's equity ratio must be measured on 30 June and 31 December each year, and shall be 22.5 per cent up to an including 31 December 2014. From 31 December 2014 until the expiration of the agreement term the equity ratio requirement will increase to 25 per cent. The convertible bond loan issued by Hurtigruten ASA is regarded as equity in relation to the loan agreement. From and including 31 December 2012 until and including 30 June 2013 the equity ratio requirement will be temporarily reduced to 20 per cent.
As part of its refinancing Hurtigruten ASA issued an unsecured bond loan of NOK 500 million. The loan has a term of five years and one month and is irredeemable until its final maturity date in April 2017. The financial covenants are as follows:
· Maximum senior debt facilities ratio
The Group's secured debt shall be less than 65 per cent of the Group's total assets until and including 30 June 2013. This percentage will be reduced annually by 5 per cent from and including 1 July 2013. From and including 1 July 2015 to the expiration of the term of the agreement, secured debt shall be lower than 50 per cent of total assets.
· Maximum leverage ratio
The Group's interest bearing debt shall be less than 6.5 per cent of the Group's EBITDA, excluding gains/ losses on the sale of assets from and including 31 December 2012. This percentage shall be reduced annually by 0.5 per cent from and including 31 December 2013. From and including 31 December 2012 until and including 30 September 2013 this requirement will be temporarily increased to 12.5 per cent. The requirement for 6.5 per cent shall also be satisfied using normalised EBITDA as a base for the calculation. Normalised EBITDA in this context is the Group's EBITDA adjusted for i) losses arising in connection with the charter arbitration case (cf. Notes 2 and 9) and ii) the provision relating to the ESA case (cf. Notes 2 and 9).
· Minimum liquidity
The Group must maintain unrestricted liquidity of at least NOK 200 million over the term of the loan.

The company also redeemed the convertible bond loan in June 2012 in accordance with the loan agreement.

Note 14 Pensions
The company has pension plans that give entitlement to defined future pension benefits. These are mainly dependent on the number of years of service, salary level upon reaching retirement age, and the size of the National Insurance benefits. These obligations are covered through an insurance company. The defined benefit pension plans cover 1,109 employees in the parent company. For maritime personnel there are three pension plans that cover different pension periods. A defined benefit plan that covers the period from age 60 to 67, and a defined contribution plan through an insurance company that covers pensions after reaching the age of 67. In addition to the pension obligations funded through insurance companies, the company has defined contribution plans for maritime personnel (Norwegian Pension Insurance for Seafarers) which are administrated by the government. The company also has an unfunded plan funded from revenue.

(1) Rood's salary is partially paid in USD and translated to NOK. (2) Fees exclusive of Value Added Tax. (3) Salaries and other remuneration are paid from the management company Hurtigruten Pluss AS, except the employee representatives'
salaries and board fees, which are paid by Hurtigruten ASA. (4) Includes the estimated cost associated with the share-based remuneration scheme.

The company's CEO receives an annual salary of NOK 2.8 million. Other benefits include fixed car remuneration and an ordinary telephone, Internet, newspaper and home PC allowance.

The CEO also has a time-limited agreement on a performance-related bonus linked to the operating result before depreciation and amortisation, where performance is indexed against the adjusted operating result before depreciation and amortisation for 2012. The bonus agreement confers the right to a maximum of two bonus payments of up to a total of NOK 7.5 million in addition to holiday pay. The agreement expires in 2015. The payment of the bonus is contingent on the CEO still being in office at the end of the year to which the bonus relates.

The CEO is included in the company's ordinary defined contribution pension scheme for salaries up to 12G and the defined contribution scheme that provides a pension basis for salaries over 12G. The CEO's conditions of employment do not include any personal pension obligations.

An option agreement has been entered into that grants the CEO the right to acquire up to three million shares. The options may not be exercised for fewer than one million shares at a time. From the
F-211

time of publication of the figures for the fourth quarter of 2013 and for a period of two months thereafter, or from the time of publication of the figures for the fourth quarter of 2014 and for a period of two months thereafter, the CEO has the right to subscribe to a million shares at a subscription price of NOK 4 per share. From the time of publication of the figures for the fourth quarter of 2014 and for a period of two months thereafter, or from the time of publication of the figures for the fourth quarter of 2015 and for a period of two months thereafter, the CEO has the right to subscribe to a million shares at a subscription price of NOK 5 per share. From the time of publication of the figures for the fourth quarter of 2015 and for a period of two months thereafter, or from the time of publication of the figures for the fourth quarter of 2016 and for a period of two months thereafter, the CEO has the right to subscribe to a million shares at a subscription price of NOK 6 per share. Options that are not exercised within the exercise period lapse without compensation. If an individual shareholder or several collaborating shareholders together should own more than fifty per cent of the shares in Hurtigruten ASA, A54 the CEO has the right to exercise all options within three months from publication of the mandatory notification.
The company's executive management are members of the company's defined contribution plan. In addition, a supplementary defined contribution pension plan has been established, which provides a pension for any salary in excess of 12 times the National Insurance basic amount (12G). The scheme applies to the whole company and covers all employees with salaries over 12G, including members of the executive management and the CEO. The pension costs for the executive management have been included under pension costs above.
The board agreed at a board meeting on 26 February 2008 to introduce a performance-based bonus scheme for the company's executive management with effect from 1 January 2008. The bonus payments are limited to one-third of each executive's annual salary, with 25 per cent of the bonus being determined by the Group's overall results, and the remaining 75 per cent being determined by the results achieved in the executive's area of responsibility. Results within the executive's area of responsibility are compared with predefined targets/ parameters. The bonus scheme includes the executive management, with the exception of the CEO. The CEO has a separate performance-related bonus scheme as described above. The executive management has waived its right to bonuses based on the 2012 financial statements.
In 2010 a share-value-based bonus scheme (synthetic options) was established for permanent employees of Hurtigruten ASA and wholly owned subsidiaries. The estimated costs for the year related to senior management covered by the plan are included under other remuneration above. Please see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the scheme.

(1) Of the amount that is to be paid within one year NOK 48 million has been recognised as an expense during the period 2008­2012.
Hurtigruten ASA entered into contracts in December 2002 and June 2003 to sell and charter back the Hurtigruten ships MS Richard With and MS Nordlys. These ships were sold to Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, respectively, and chartered back for a period of 15 years with an option for an additional 5 years on market terms. For the first 15 years the charter hire payments consist of three components; fixed hire in NOK, fixed hire in USD/EUR and a variable element in USD/EUR. The variable element is linked to variable interest rates, 6-month Libor and Euribor rates.
Hurtigruten ASA will undertake and pay for the operation, insurance and all necessary ongoing maintenance of the ships. In the charter agreements between the limited partnerships and Hurtigruten ASA, identical requirements (covenants) have been stipulated for Hurtigruten ASA for the term of the agreements, which the company has as a component of its long-term loan agreements linked to the ships. Please see Note 10 with regard to these financial covenants.
In connection with the financial restructuring in February 2009, an agreement was agreed on with the limited partnerships Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, which entailed that the instalment component of the charter hire under the charter parties with the two limited partnerships would not be payable for the period up to 31 December 2011. The postponed instalments would, however, be added to the instalments that were paid in 2012 and will be paid 2013, thereby reverting to the original repayment plan in August 2013. An increase in the charter hire was also agreed to compensate for the increased costs incurred by the limited partnerships under their loan agreements because of the changes in the repayment profile. In addition, it has been agreed that Hurtigruten's option to buy back MS Nordlys and MS Richard With will be cancelled. The annual rent and the instalments that accrue in accordance with the agreement are recognised as an expense in the financial statements. In the first quarter of 2011 Hurtigruten ASA made an extraordinary instalment payment on the bareboat charter hire. The extraordinary instalment payment was made through the release of funds that were restricted as security for the charter agreement. These funds were used in their entirety for an extraordinary repayment of borrowings in the two limited partnerships.

TO THE ANNUAL SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING OF HURTIGRUTEN ASA
AUDITOR'S REPORT
REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Hurtigruten ASA, comprising the financial statements for the Parent Company and the Group. The financial statements of the Parent Company and the Group comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2011, the statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for the year then ended as well as a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The Board of Directors' and Chief Executive Officer's responsibility for the financial statements
The Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway for the financial statements of the Parent Company and the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU for the Group, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements for the Parent Company and the Group.
Opinion on the financial statements of the Parent Company
In our opinion, the financial statements of Hurtigruten ASA have been prepared in accordance with laws and regulations and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of 31 December 2011 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway.

regulations and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as of 31 December 2011 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards on Accounting as adopted by the EU.

Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Directors' report and the statement on corporate governance concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption and the proposal for the allocation of the result is consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations. Opinion on registration and documentation
Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have considered necessary in accordance with the international standard on assurance engagements (ISAE) 3000, «Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information», it is our opinion that the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer have fulfilled their duty to ensure that the Company's accounting information is properly recorded and documented as required by law and generally accepted bookkeeping practice in Norway.

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the group's consolidated financial statements
are described below. Unless otherwise stated in the description, these policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented.
F-225

2.1 Basic policies
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on historical cost basis, with the following modifications:
· financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group's accounting policies. Areas which make extensive use of discretionary assessments or involve a high degree of complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are described in note 3.
The group's consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to uniform accounting policies for similar transactions and events under similar conditions.
2.1.1 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the group, which have no significant effect on accounts at this time
The group made no changes to its accounting policies in 2011.
· IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. Changes in the requirement to show all items under other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity.
· IAS 24 Related party disclosures. The revised standard clarifies and simplifies the definition of a related party and removes the requirement for government-related entities to disclose details of all transactions with the government and other government-related entities.
· IAS 32 (amendment) Classification of rights issues. The amendment addresses the accounting for rights issues that are in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuer. Provided these conditions are met, such rights issues are now classified as equity, regardless of the currency in which the exercise price is denominated. Previously, these issues had to be accounted for as financial liabilities. The amendment is retroactive, in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
· IAS 34 Interim Financial Statements. The amendments include clearer note requirements for significant events in interim financial reporting, including impairments, changes in classification or measurement of financial instruments, etc.
· IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The amendment requires that transactions with non-controlling interests who do not have the right to a share of the net assets be measured at fair value on the acquisition date.
· IFRS 7 Financial Instruments--Disclosures. Eased note requirements for credit risk, which entails that information is no longer necessary if maximum credit loss is equal to the carrying amount, as well as less comprehensive information requirements for pledged assets.
· IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. Points accrued in bonus programs shall be measured at the fair value of redeemable goods and services.
· IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments. The interpretation regulates accounting when a financial liability is renegotiated and the creditor extinguishes all or part of the financial liability in exchange for the issuing of equity instruments ("debt for equity swap"). The debtor records a gain or loss from the conversion, which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued. If the fair value of the equity instruments issued cannot be reliably measured, the value is set as equivalent to the financial liability extinguished.
· Other changes as a result of IASB's annual improvement project.
F-226

(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations for existing standards that have not entered into force and which the group has not selected for early implementation:
The impact of these changes is expected to be:
· IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. Amendments affecting the presentation of other comprehensive income, differentiating between items that later will be reversed in profit or loss and items that will not be reversed in profit or loss. The group will implement these amendments from 1 July 2012.
· IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Instruments regulates the classification, measurement and accounting of financial assets and liabilities. IFRS 9 was published in November 2009 and October 2010, and replaces those sections of IAS 39 dealing with accounting, classification and measurement of financial instruments. Under IFRS 9, financial assets should be divided into two categories, based on measurement method: those that are measured at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. A classification assessment is performed upon initial accounting. The classification will depend on the company's business model for managing its financial instruments and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows from the instrument. Requirements for financial liabilities are mainly similar to IAS 39. The main difference, in cases where the fair value of financial liabilities is used, is that the portion of the change in fair value attributable to a change in the company's own credit risk will be recognised in other comprehensive income instead of in the income statement, as long as it does not cause an accrual discrepancy in the measurement of profit or loss. The group plans to apply IFRS 9 when the standard takes effect and has been approved by the EU. The standard takes effect for accounting periods beginning 1 January 2013 or later, but IASB has distributed for comment a proposal for deferred commencement to accounting periods beginning 1 January 2015 or later.
· IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements is based on current policies regarding the concept of control as the determining factor for whether a company should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. The standard provides extensive instructions for assessing whether or not control exists in difficult cases. The group has not assessed all of the potential consequences of IFRS 10. The group is planning to apply the standard to accounting periods beginning 1 January 2013 and later.
· IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interest in Other Entities contains information requirements for economic interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, special purpose entities (SPE) and other off-balance sheet companies. The group has not assessed the full impact of IFRS 12. The group is planning to apply the standard to accounting periods beginning 1 January 2013 and later.
· IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement defines what is meant by the term "fair value" in IFRS, provides a uniform definition of how fair value should be determined in IFRS and defines which additional information should be provided when fair value is used. The standard does not extend the scope of accounting to fair value but provides information on its application where use of fair value is already required or permitted in the other IFRS's. The group uses fair value as a measurement criterion for certain assets and liabilities. The group has not assessed the full impact of IFRS 13. The group is planning to apply the standard to accounting periods beginning 1 January 2013 and later.
2.2 Consolidation principles
(a) Subsidiaries and consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are exercisable or convertible at the balance sheet date are considered when assessing whether the group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is transferred to the group and are excluded from consolidation when control ceases.
Intragroup transactions, intercompany balances and unrealised intragroup profits and losses are eliminated. If necessary, the subsidiaries' accounts are revised to achieve consistency with the group's accounting policies.
F-227

Transactions with non-controlling shareholders in subsidiaries are treated as equity transactions. When shares are purchased from non-controlling shareholders, the difference between the remuneration and the share's proportionate carrying amount of the subsidiary's net assets is recorded in equity for the parent company's shareholders. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling shareholders are also recorded in equity.
When the group no longer has control, any remaining shareholdings are recognised at fair value, with changes in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect to that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of underlying assets and liabilities. This may entail that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
(b) SPE
A sale-leaseback solution was carried into effect in 2002 with the Hurtigruten vessel MS Richard With, whereby Kystruten KS acquired the vessel and leased it back for a 15 year period. Correspondingly, a saleleaseback solution was carried into effect with the Hurtigruten vessel MS Nordlys, whereby Kirberg Shipping KS acquired the vessel and leased it back for a 15-year period. On the basis of established contracts, Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS are considered to be SPEs (special purpose entities), which are to be consolidated in the Hurtigruten group. This has been done by recognising the vessel's book value and external liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. Previously recognised gains are corrected against equity. The KS's accounts have been revised to apply the same accounting policies as used by Hurtigruten group.
Changes in accounting policies
As a consequence of the revised standard for consolidated accounts and financial accounts (IAS 27 revised), the group has changed its accounting policy for transactions with non-controlling interests and accounting in connection with loss of control or significant influence at 1 January 2010. The revision to IAS 27 contained consequential amendments to IAS 28, Investments in Associates and IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures.
Previously, transactions with non-controlling interests were treated as transactions with 3rd parties. Disposals therefore resulted in gains or losses in profit or loss and purchases resulted in the recognition of goodwill. On disposal or partial disposal, a proportionate interest in reserves attributable to the subsidiary was reclassified to profit or loss or directly to retained earnings.
Remaining ownership interests upon the loss of control or significant influence were previously measured as a proportional share of the amount recognised in the balance sheet.
The group has applied this new accounting policy to transactions occurring on or after 1 January 2010. No adjustments were made to any of the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements.
2.3 Business combinations
Business combinations are recognised using the acquisition method. The consideration is measured at the fair value of any transferred assets, liabilities or issued equity instruments. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value and is included in the consideration. The contingent consideration is classified as a liability under IAS 39 and recognised at fair value in subsequent periods, with the change of value recognised in profit or loss. In cases where the contingent consideration is classified as equity, fair value measured at the acquisition date remains unchanged. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values on the date of acquisition. Non-controlling interests in the acquired company are measured on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value, or at their proportionate share of the company's net assets.
If the amount of the consideration, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests and the fair value on the date of acquisition of previous equity interests exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired company, the difference is recorded as goodwill, cf. note 2.8. If the sum is less than the company's net assets, the difference is recognised immediately.
F-228

2.4 Associates
Associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control. Significant influence normally exists for investments where the group owns 20­50 per cent of the voting capital. Investments in associates are initially recognised at the initial carrying amount and subsequently using the equity method. Goodwill is included in the amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of the investment. At the time of reporting, the group assesses whether there are indications of an impairment of the investment. If there are such indications, the recoverable value of the investment amount is estimated when calculating any impairment loss.
The group's share of associates' profit or loss is recognised in profit and loss, and is added to the book value of the investments. The group's share of associates' other comprehensive income is recognised in the group's other comprehensive income and is also added to the book value of the investments. The group does not recognise any share of an associate's losses in its income statement if this results in the book value of the investment falling below zero (including unsecured receivables from the entity), unless the group has assumed liabilities or made payments on behalf of the associate.
The group's share of unrealised profits on transactions between the group and its associates are eliminated. The same applies to unrealised losses, unless the transaction justifies an impairment of the transferred asset. When necessary, the associates' accounts are revised to achieve consistency with the group's accounting policies.
Gains and losses with respect to the dilution of assets in associates are recognised in profit and loss.
When the group no longer has a significant influence, any remaining shareholdings are recognised at fair value with changes in value recognised in profit and loss. Then, the fair value is the initial carrying amount for subsequent accounting as a financial asset. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect to that entity are accounted for as if the associate had directly disposed of underlying assets and liabilities. This may entail that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. When the group's shareholding in an associate is reduced, but a significant influence is retained, a proportional amount of the sum previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit and loss.
2.5 Segment reporting
An operating segment is a part of the business that delivers products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from other operating segments. The group has four operating segments, called product areas: Hurtigruten Norwegian coast, Explorer products, Spitsbergen and Charter. Activities that do not naturally fall within these four segments are grouped into Other business. These operating segments are reported in the same way as internal reporting to the board of directors and executive management.
2.6 Translation of foreign currencies
(a) Functional and presentation currency
The financial statements of the individual entities in the group are measured in the currency used in the economic area in which the entity primarily operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Norwegian kroner (NOK), which is both the parent company's functional currency and the group's presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balance sheet items
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using average exchange rates. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies on the balance sheet date are recognised in the income statement. If the currency position is considered a cash flow hedge, gains and losses are recognised as other comprehensive income.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on loans, cash and cash equivalents are presented (net) in the income statement as financial income or expense.
F-229

(c) Group companies
The income statement and balance sheet of all group entities (none subject to hyperinflation) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
· The balance sheet is translated at the closing rate on the balance sheet date.
· The income statement is translated at the average exchange rate.
· Translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and specified separately in equity as a separate item.

2.7 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment consist primarily of ships (Hurtigruten ships), land and buildings (hotels, offices and workshops) as well as buses. Property, plant and equipment are recognised at their initial carrying amount less depreciation. The initial carrying amount includes costs directly associated with the acquisition of the asset. The initial carrying amount also comprises the gains or losses transferred from other income and expenses at the time of purchase, due to cash flow hedging in foreign currency for purchases of non-current assets.

Subsequent expenses are added to the asset's book value or are recognised separately in the balance sheet (periodic maintenance) when it is probable that any future financial benefits associated with the expense will devolve to the group, and the expense can be reliably measured. The carrying amount of replaced parts is recognised. Other repair and maintenance expenses are recognised in profit and loss in the period in which the expenses are incurred.

Land is not depreciated. Other operating assets are depreciated linearly, such that the initial carrying amount is depreciated to residual value over the asset's expected useful life. Expected useful life is determined on the basis of historical figures, as well as the standard lifetimes in the industry. Residual value is calculated on the basis of estimated sales values for operating assets at the end of their expected useful life. Expected useful life is:

Ships Buildings Vehicles Other

12­30 years 25­100 years 5­12 years 3­10 years

The useful life and residual value of operating assets are assessed on every balance sheet date and amended as necessary. When important components of operating assets have different useful lives, these operating assets are recognised as their various components. These components are depreciated separately over each component's useful life. At the end of each accounting period operating assets are assessed for indications of lasting impairment and, in the event of such impairment, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. When the book value of an operating asset is higher than the estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to the recoverable amount.

Gains and losses on disposals are recognised in the income statement under "Other (losses)/gains--net", as the difference between the sales price and the carrying amount.

Received investment grants for hotel construction on Svalbard are recognised using the gross method and recognised in revenue in line with depreciation of the corresponding asset.

2.8 Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill is the difference between the initial carrying amount of an acquisition and the fair value of the group's share of the entity's net identifiable assets at the time of acquisition. Goodwill in connection with the acquisition of subsidiaries is classified as an intangible asset. Assessments are made annually for the impairment of goodwill. The recoverable amount is estimated for calculating any impairment. Goodwill is written down to the recoverable amount, when this is lower than the book value. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains or losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill related to the divested entity.
F-230

When assessing the need for impairment of goodwill, it is allocated to the relevant cash-generating entities (operating segments). Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating entities or groups of cash-generating entities that are expected to benefit from the acquisition (note 2.9).
(b) Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are largely directly associated with development costs for computer systems
recognised in the balance sheet at their initial carrying amount, if the criteria for capitalisation are met. The criteria for capitalisation are:
· Probable usage of the asset in the company can be proved. · Future economic benefits to the company associated with use of the asset can be calculated. · Development costs for the asset can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets are considered to have a limited life span, and are amortised over their expected useful life. Assessments are made at the end of each accounting period to find any indications of impairment of intangible assets. If there are indications of impairment, the intangible assets are written down to their recoverable value when this is lower than the book value. Later expenses for recognised intangible assets are recognised only when they increase the future economic benefits related to this asset. All other costs are expensed during the period in which they are incurred.
Other development expenditures that do not meet the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as they are incurred. Development expenditures that have already been expensed cannot be recognised as an asset in future periods.
2.9 Impairment of non-financial assets Intangible assets with indefinite useful life and goodwill are not amortised but are tested annually or more
frequently if there are indications of impairment. Depreciated property, plant and equipment and amortised intangible assets are assessed for impairment when there is any indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The difference between the carrying amount and recoverable amount is recorded as impairment loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less sales costs and its value in use. In assessing impairments, non-current assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). At each reporting date the possibility of reversing previous impairment of nonfinancial assets (except goodwill) is assessed.
2.10 Discontinued business and non-current assets held-for-sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held-for-sale if their carrying amounts will be
recovered through sale and not through continued use. This condition is deemed to be fulfilled if a sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its current condition. Management at the relevant level must have made a commitment to complete the sale and the transaction must be expected to be completed within one year of the classification date.
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) that are classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lowest of previous carrying amount and net sale value, and are not depreciated.
A discontinued business is a segment that has been disposed of or classified as held-for-sale, and which represents a significant business area, geographical region, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale.
Net profits or losses after tax for discontinued business are reported separately from income from continued business. Results from the previous period for discontinued business are reclassified in order to get comparable numbers. Assets and liabilities classified as held-for-sale are presented on separate lines on the balance sheet under current assets and current liabilities respectively. Previous periods are not revised on the balance sheet.
F-231

2.11 Financial assets 2.11.1 Classification
The group classifies financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, as well as loans and receivables. The classification depends on the object of the asset. Management determines the classification of financial assets at initial recognition.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held-for-trading. A financial asset is
classified in this category if it was acquired primarily to provide a profit from short-term price fluctuations. Derivatives are categorised as held-for-trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
(b) Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed payments that are not traded in an
active market. They are classified as current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are classified as "trade and other receivables" in the balance sheet (note 2.16).
2.11.2 Recognition and measurement Regular purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade-date, which is the day the group
commits to purchase or sell the asset. All financial assets that are not recognised at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets recognised at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investment expire or when these rights have been transferred and the group has substantially transferred all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial assets recognised at fair value in profit or loss are carried at fair value after initial recognition in the balance sheet. Loans and receivables are carried in successive periods at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
Gains or losses from changes in fair value of assets classified as "financial assets at fair value through profit or loss", including interest income and dividends, are included in the income statement under financial items in the period in which they arise. Dividends from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are included in the income statement when the group's right to receive payments is established.
2.12 Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities may only be offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when
there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
2.13 Impairment of financial assets Assets carried at amortised cost
At the end of each reporting period, the group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the assets (a "loss event") and the impact of that loss event (or events) on estimated future cash flows can be estimated reliably.
The criteria that the group uses to determine whether there is objective evidence of an impairment loss include:
· Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or debtor; · Breach of contract, such as default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; · The group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, granting to the
borrower a concession that the lender would not otherwise consider;
F-232

· It becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial restructuring;
· The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties;
· Observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a portfolio of financial assets since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the portfolio's individual financial assets, including:
· Adverse changes in the payment status of the portfolio's borrowers.
· National or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the portfolio's assets.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The asset's carrying amount is reduced and the amount of the loss recognised in the consolidated income statement.
If the impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the fall in value was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor's credit rating), the previous loss is reversed in the consolidated income statement. Reversal of previous losses must not exceed the expected value, if the impairment had not been made.
Impairment testing of trade receivables is described in note 2.16.
2.14 Derivatives and hedging
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value on an ongoing basis. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The group classifies derivatives that are part of a hedging instrument as either:
i. hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge) or
ii. hedges with variable cash flows with a particular risk associated with a recognised asset, liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
At the inception of the transaction, the group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The group also documents whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Such assessments are documented both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis.
The fair values of derivatives used for hedging purposes are presented in note 11C. Changes in the equity item hedging are presented in note 16. The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or long-term liability if the remaining term of the hedging item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or current liability if the remaining term of the hedging item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as current assets or current liabilities.
Cash flow hedging
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges is recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Losses and profits on the ineffective portion are recognised in the income statement.
Hedge gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are recognised as income or expense in the period during which the hedged item affects the income statement (for example, when the planned sale is taking place). Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate loans are recognised in the income statement under "financial expenses". Gains or losses on the ineffective portion are recognised in the income statement. When the forecast hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (such as inventories or tangible non-current assets), the gains and losses previously recognised within other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in cost of goods sold or in depreciation of tangible noncurrent assets.
F-233

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement. When a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
2.15 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-
out (FIFO) method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to sell.
2.16 Trade receivables Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the
ordinary course of business. If settlement is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are classified as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised and presented at the original invoice amount and written down following "loss events" which have an impact on the payment of the receivable that can be reliably estimated. Thus, trade receivables are accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The interest element is disregarded if it is insignificant.
2.17 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, bank deposits and other short-term liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities in the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents are defined differently in the balance sheet and cash flow presentation. Restricted capital is included in the balance sheet presentation but not in the cash flow presentation
2.18 Share capital and premiums Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Expenses directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any group company purchases the company's equity share capital (own shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable transaction costs (net of taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to owners of the parent until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to owners of the parent.
2.19 Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are classified as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequently, trade payables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The interest element is disregarded if it is insignificant.
2.20 Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, borrowings
are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings as part of the effective interest.
F-234

2.21 Compound financial instruments
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, borrowings are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings as part of the effective interest.
The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is recognised initially at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not re-measured subsequent to initial recognition.
2.22 Current and deferred taxes
The tax expense for a period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In such case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is calculated in accordance with the tax laws and regulations enacted or substantively enacted on the balance sheet date in the countries where the company's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax laws are subject to interpretation. Based on management's assessment, a provision is made for expected tax payments when necessary.
Deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, on all temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax is not recognised in the balance sheet if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination, which at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and tax laws which have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and which are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised, or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the tax-reducing temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences is controlled by the group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The group makes provisions for uncertain and contested tax positions. This provision is reversed if the contested tax position is decided in favour of the group and can no longer be appealed.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities related to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.23 Pension obligations, bonus plans and other employee benefits
(a) Pension obligations
Group companies operate various pension schemes. The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The group has both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension scheme under which the group pays fixed contributions to a separate entity. The group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the entity does not have sufficient assets to pay all employees
F-235

the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension scheme that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement. Pension payments are dependent on one or more factors such as age, number of years of service and salary.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of plan assets. The pension obligation is calculated annually by an independent actuary. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation, alternatively government bond rates if such rates are not available. For Norwegian schemes, the 10-year government bond rate at the balance sheet date is used, with an additional provision taking into account relevant terms to maturity for the pension obligations.
Variances from estimates arising from experience adjustments or changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in equity within other comprehensive income, for the period in which they arise.
Changes in pension scheme benefits are recognised immediately as expenses or income in the income statement, unless rights in the new pension scheme are conditional on the employee remaining in service for a specific period of time (the vesting period). In such case, the costs associated with the change in benefit are amortised linearly over the vesting period.
For defined contribution plans, the group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as payroll costs when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
The Norwegian Parliament (Storting) adopted a new law on the AFP early retirement scheme in February 2010. The new AFP early retirement scheme is accounted as a benefit-based multi-entity plan. This entails that individual entities account for their proportional share of the plan's pension obligations, assets and costs. Until there is reliable and consistent information for provisions, the new AFP early retirement scheme is recognised as a defined contribution plan.
(b) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are discounted to the present value. A discount rate before tax that reflects the current market situation and is risk-specific for the liability concerned is used. Any increase in the liability as a result of changed time values is recognised as an interest expense.
(c) Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to the parent company's shareholders after certain adjustments. The group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
2.24 Provisions
Provisions for restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination benefits. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses; however, provisions for unprofitable contracts are recognised.
F-236

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. Thus a provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. A discount rate before tax that reflects the current market situation and is risk-specific for the obligation concerned is used. Any increase in the obligation as a result of changed time values is recognised as an interest expense.
2.25 Revenue recognition Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised at the fair value, net of VAT, returns, discounts,
and rejects. Intragroup sales are eliminated.
Sales are recognised when revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the group and specific criteria related to the various forms of sale that are listed below are met. The group bases its accounting estimates on historic income, an assessment of the type of customer and transaction concerned, as well as any specific conditions attached to the individual transaction.
Revenues are recognised in the income statement as follows:
(a) Sales of services and travel Sales of services are recognised in the accounting period when the service is rendered and/or delivered. For
ship voyages, this is based on the days the passenger is on board. Revenues related to ship voyages are accrued on the basis of the number of days the voyage lasts before and after the end of the accounting period. Prepaid revenues on the balance sheet date are recognised as debt. Earned but not invoiced services are recognised in the income statement on the balance sheet date as a receivable.
(b) Sales of goods Sales of goods are recognised when an entity within the group has sold the product to the customer. The sale
is considered completed when the customer has received the item after payment. Payment for retail transactions is usually made in the form of cash or by credit card. The revenue is recognised in the income statement including the credit card fees incurred for the transaction. The fees are recorded as sales expenses.
(c) Public procurement Revenues received from public procurement are recognised in the income statement on a continuous basis
over the year on the basis of existing contracts. These contracts are primarily based on a tender, where the company has a fixed contract sum for planned (annual) production. There are specific conditions and calculation methods for the indexation of the contract sum. Any changes beyond the planned production are compensated/ deducted utilising agreed-upon rates set out in the agreements, and recognised in the periods in which they occur.
(d) Rental income Rental income is recognised continuously over the year, divided by the number of days/months the tenant
has had the object at their disposal in relation to the agreement.
(e) Interest income Interest income is recognised in accordance with the effective interest method. Should an impairment of
loans and trade receivables be required, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is estimated future cash flow discounted by the original effective interest rate. After impairment, interest income is recognised based on the original effective interest rate.
F-237

(f) Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
2.26 Leases 2.26.1 The group as lessee
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a linear basis over the period of the lease.
When the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, leases are classified as finance leases. Assets secured through finance leases are recognised in the income statement at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payment. The group employs the implicit interest rate for the lease in its calculations. Direct expenditures related to entering the contract are added to the amount recognised as an asset. Assets are depreciated according to the asset's expected useful life.
Debt to the lessor is recognised in the balance sheet as a finance lease liability. The liability is reduced by lease payments less estimated interest expenses.
2.26.2 The group as lessor The group leases out vessels on time charter and bareboat agreements. All of the group's leasing agreements
for vessels are considered a lease of assets and fall under IAS 17 Leases. These leases are considered operating leases based on the structure and duration of the agreement.
(a) Time charter The group leases out vessels on time charter (TC). For time charters (supplytime 89), the vessel is leased out
with a crew. The lessee determines, within the limitations of the lease, how the vessel will be used. The lessor covers operating costs, such as crew, operational supplies, insurance, repairs and administration, while the lessee covers costs such as bunkers and port fees. In addition to the lease of vessels, there are, in some instances, agreements for additional services such as extra crew, sale of provisions and coverage of other operating costs. Revenues from leasing vessels on time charters are recognised linearly over the duration of the lease. The lease period starts from the time the vessel is at the disposal of the lessee and ceases upon the agreed return delivery. Leasing of additional crew and considerations for coverage of other operating costs are recognised linearly over the duration of the lease.
Services supplied in connection with a time charter are recognised in the accounting period when the service is rendered and/or delivered. Ref. note 2.25.
(b) Bareboat In a bareboat agreement, all operational risk rests with the lessee, who is responsible for covering all costs
related to the vessel. Revenues from leasing vessels on bareboat agreements are recognised linearly over the duration of the lease. The lease period starts from the time the vessel is at the disposal of the lessee and ceases upon the agreed return delivery.
2.27 Dividends Dividend distribution to the parent company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the group's
financial statements when the dividends are approved by the general meeting.
2.28 Government grants Government grants are recognised at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be
received and that the group will meet the terms of the grant.
F-238

2.29 Classification and maintenance costs In connection with docking vessels, expenditures and improvements required by the classification will be
capitalised and depreciated over time up to the next class survey/docking. The same applies to costs for class recertification. Periodic maintenance is recognised in the balance sheet and expensed over the period until the next periodic maintenance. The initial carrying amount of newbuildings and second-hand tonnage is decomposed (note 2.7), with a portion corresponding to the first periodic maintenance cost recognised in the balance sheet and expensed over the period until the next periodic maintenance. On the disposal of vessels, capitalised costs charged to expenses will be classified as part of the gain/loss.
Fast ferries, classified as discontinued business and as held-for-sale, are subject to regular annual classification with costs expensed on a continuous basis.
Ongoing maintenance for all vessel types is expensed continuously during the period in which the work is performed.
2.30 Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of operating assets are recognised in the balance
sheet until the asset is ready for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed.
2.31 Remuneration based on share prices The group has remuneration based on share price, structured as synthetic options with cash settlements.
The fair value of options allocated during the period is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This is done quarterly. Key inputs for calculations are: the share price at allotment date, exercise prices, the standard deviation of expected stock returns and annual risk-free interest rate. Volatility measured using the standard deviation of expected returns is based on statistical analysis of the daily share price for the agreed period.
The fair value is expensed over the vesting period. On each balance sheet date, the group reviews its estimates for the number of expected options. The group recognises any effects of changes to the original estimates in the income statement.
NOTE 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Estimates and discretionary assessments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on past experience,
consultation with experts, trend analyses and other factors, including forecasted future events that are regarded as likely under current circumstances.
3.1 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions The group makes estimates and assumptions about the future. By definition, the accounting estimates that
are made as a result of the above processes will rarely fully correspond with the final outcome. Estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below.
(a) Estimated impairment of goodwill The group performs annual tests to assess impairment of goodwill, cf. note 2.8. The estimated recoverable
amount is determined using the present value of budgeted cash flows for the cash-generating units. These calculations require the use of estimates (note 9) for the required rate of return for the period, cash flows and the growth factor of the cash flows.
The group does not use a general growth factor beyond expected inflation for cash flows when testing goodwill for impairment. The required rate of return used to discount cash flows is calculated as a weighted average return on equity and the required rate of return on interest-bearing debt. This calculation utilises an estimate of the risk-free interest rate, risk premium, beta and the liquidity premium.
F-239

(b) Ships
Useful economic lifetime
The level of depreciation depends on the estimated economic life of the ships. This estimate is based on history and experience related to the group's ships. The estimate is re-assessed periodically. A change in the estimate will affect depreciation in future periods.

Estimated impairment of ships
On indication, the group tests whether ships have suffered any impairment, see note 2.7. The estimated recoverable amount is determined using the present value of budgeted cash flows for the cash-generating units. Ships are considered within their segment as a collective cash-generating unit. These calculations require the use of estimates (note 8) for the required rate of return for the period, cash flows and the growth factor of the cash flows.
The group does not use a general growth factor beyond expected inflation for cash flows when testing ships for impairment. The required rate of return used to discount cash flows is calculated as a weighted average return on equity and the required rate of return on interest-bearing debt. This calculation utilises an estimate of the riskfree interest rate, risk premium, beta and the liquidity premium.

(c) Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques. The group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and to make assumptions based mainly on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. Refer to note 11A for more information.

(d) Pension assumptions
The group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes. Measurement of pension cost and pension obligations for defined benefit plans requires that the actuary include a number of assumptions and estimates such as discount rate, level of future salary, expected employee turnover rate, return on plan assets, annual pension increase, the expected G-regulation (the National Insurance Scheme basic amount) and demographic assumptions.
The group has pension obligations in Norway and Germany. The discount rate used to calculate pension obligations in Norway is based on the 10-year government bond rate at the balance sheet date, with an additional provision taking into account relevant terms to maturity for the pension obligations. Hurtigruten's pension obligations for 2011 apply to Norway. The discount rate applied in Norway at 31 December 2011 is 2.6 per cent, in accordance with guidance from the Norwegian Accounting Standards Board on the determination of pension assumptions at 31 December 2011. For obligations in Germany, the discount rate is determined by the interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, with terms to maturity approximating the term of the related pension obligation. The discount rate applied in Germany at 31 December 2011 is 4.6 per cent.
Changes in pension assumptions would affect the pension obligation and pension cost for the period. Pension obligations are significantly affected by changes in the discount rate, life expectancy and expected salary and pension adjustments.
Refer to note 19 for more information about pensions.

(e) Income tax

Income tax is calculated based on results in the individual group companies. The group is subject to income

taxes in several jurisdictions. Calculation of the period's tax expense and distribution of tax payable and deferred

tax for the period requires a discretionary assessment of complex tax regulations in several countries. Therefore,

there will be uncertainty about the final tax liability for many transactions and calculations. Where there is a

discrepancy

between

the

final

tax

outcome

and

the

F-240

amounts that were initially recorded, this discrepancy will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made. Refer to note 18 for more information about income tax.
(f) Deferred tax assets The basis for recognising deferred tax assets is based mainly on the utilisation of loss-carry forwards
through future taxable income in the group. The assessment is made based on management's estimates of future profits in the group and includes an assessment of the group's future strategy, economic developments in the markets in which the group operates, future tax regimes and the group's ability to deliver forecasted synergies. In the presentation of the financial statements, management has assessed the future taxable income to be sufficient to utilise the recognised deferred income tax assets. Refer to note 18 for more information on recognised deferred tax assets.
(g) Disputes, claims and regulatory requirements The group is a party to, or affected by disputes, claims and regulatory requirements where the outcome is to
a large degree unknown. Among other things, management considers the probability of negative outcomes and opportunities for estimating any loss in the event of such negative outcomes. Unexpected events or changes to factors taken into consideration that have an impact on specific conditions, may result in increases or reductions to provisions. Such changes may also result in that new provisions must be made for conditions that were previously assessed as an unlikely outcome or for which it was previously not possible to make reliable estimates.
3.2 Important discretionary assessments utilising the entity's accounting policies (a) Provisions for the possible return of income in connection with a supplementary agreement
In connection with a case in front of the EFTA court, the group's management has made a discretionary provision of NOK 35 million. Refer to note 5 for more information.
(b) Provisions for possible losses in connection with charters In connection with an open arbitration case in Australia, the group's management has made a discretionary
provision of NOK 46 million. Refer to note 5 for more information.
(c) Assets held-for-sale The group's fast ferries are classified as held-for-sale. This classification is made based on the
management's decision on the sale of the fast ferries after operation of the fast ferry business was discontinued. Refer to note 7 for more information.
NOTE 4 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The group uses financial instruments such as bank loans, bonds and convertible bonds. The purpose of these
financial instruments is to provide capital for investments necessary for the group's operations. In addition, the group utilises financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables, etc., that are directly related to dayto-day operations. The group uses certain financial derivatives for hedging purposes. The group uses financial derivatives for trading purposes to a limited extent.
4.1 Financial risk factors The group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks (including currency, price, fair
value interest rate and floating interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The group's overarching risk management goal is to increase predictability for the group's operations and to minimise the impact of fluctuations in macro conditions on the group's results and financial position.
The group has defined overarching principles for risk management which encompass guidelines for specific areas such as currency, interest rate and credit risk, the use of financial derivatives, and the management of surplus liquidity. The board of directors approves the group's risk management
F-241

strategy and follows up risk exposure quarterly. The CFO function is responsible for conducting ongoing tactical risk management in line with the approved strategy, including exposure analyses and reporting.

(a) Market risk
(i) Currency risk
The group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk in multiple currencies, in particular, the euro (EUR), US dollar (USD), pound sterling (GBP) and the Australian dollar (AUD). Currency risk arises from future ticket sales as well as recognised assets or liabilities. In addition, fuel cost is quoted in USD. Currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency which is not the entity's functional currency.

The group's risk management policy is aimed at securing 60­80 per cent of net expected cash flows in EUR for the next one to two years, using transparent and liquid financial derivatives, normally futures contracts combined with foreign currency loans. Forward hedges have been made on 60 per cent of net expected cash flows in EUR for 2012. The company implemented a refinancing of debt that was completed in March 2012. Portions of the loan can be converted from NOK to EUR to achieve a "natural hedge". The exact time for the conversion has not been set.

In connection with the 18 month lease of MS Finnmarken as a hotel ship to Boskalis Australia Pty Limited, starting in April 2010, the group has also had foreign currency hedges in AUD, equivalent to approximately 60 per cent of the expected cash flow for the remaining period of the contract. These foreign currency hedges expired simultaneously with the contract 30 October 2011.

The price of oil, and thus bunker oil, is internationally traded in USD, while the group purchases bunker oil in NOK. The risk can therefore be split into a currency element and a product element. The currency element is partially aligned with the group's cash flow exposure in USD, and the product risk is hedged separately.

Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS are consolidated in accordance with IFRS SIC-12 Consolidation-- special purpose entities. The two entities have portions of their debt in EUR and USD. The group is therefore exposed to currency risk when paying interest and converting this debt to NOK. The debt in EUR and USD is partially hedged through the group's net revenues in these currencies.

The group has minor investments in foreign subsidiaries whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.

The table below shows the group's sensitivity to potential changes in the exchange rate for NOK against relevant currencies in relation to the exchange rate on 31 December, with all other variables held constant. Changes mainly relate to foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of financial derivatives, borrowings, trade receivables, cash in bank and other placements.

The calculations assume that the NOK weakens by 5 per cent against the relevant currencies. With an equivalent strengthening of the NOK, the amounts would have the opposite value. The effect on equity is different than the effect on profit/loss because the currency and bunker derivatives are recognised as hedges and adjustments are recognised directly in equity.

(ii) Price risk The group is exposed to bunker price risk and the board of directors has approved a strategy of quarterly
rolling hedges of 20­80 per cent of estimated future consumption for 4­6 future quarters, where the group hedges a larger share of consumption in the near future and a smaller share further
F-242

ahead. In addition, the group has a stop-loss strategy where it attempts to hedge the unhedged amount if the price of oil rises above a predefined threshold. Hedges are made in the forward market on 48 per cent of expected bunker consumption for 2012, distributed with a higher proportion in the coming quarters, and a lower proportion towards the end of the year.

The table below shows the group's sensitivity to potential changes in price of bunker, with all other variables held constant.

These calculations are based on the average unhedged bunker volume, and indicate how an increase of 20 per cent in bunker prices would have had an impact on financial statements for 2010 and 2011. The effect on equity is different than the effect on profit/loss because these hedging activities fulfil the requirements for hedge accounting and unrealised changes in value are recognised directly in equity.

(iii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The group's interest rate risk is associated with current and non-current debt. Loans with a variable interest rate present a risk to the group's total cash flow. Fixed interest rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk. Over the course of 2010 and 2011, the group's loans at variable interest rates were mainly in NOK. A portion of the loans assumed by Kystruten KS (SPE) and Kirberg Shipping KS (SPE) are in EUR and USD.

The group manages its variable interest rate risk through variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps involve converting loans with variable interest rates to fixed-interest loans. Through interest rate swaps, the group enters into contracts with other parties to swap the difference between the contract's fixed interest rate and the amount of the variable interest rate calculated on the agreed principal. At 31 December 2011, a smaller portion (approximately 8 per cent) of the group's debt was hedged. In connection with Hurtigruten's refinancing of debt in March 2012, interest rate hedges will be established for 40­60 per cent of the bank loan.

The table below shows the group's sensitivity to potential changes in interest rate levels, with all other variables held constant. These calculations take all interest-bearing instruments and associated derivatives into consideration.

An increase of 0.5 per cent in the variable interest rate would increase the group's interest costs by approximately NOK 11.4 million (2010: NOK 12.2 million) net of tax. Equity would have been NOK 1.1 million (2010: NOK 1.1 million) higher as a result of the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps.

(b) Credit risk
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk. Sales to end users are settled in cash or with recognised credit cards. Sales to external agents occur either through prepayment/credit cards or through invoicing. The group has routines to ensure that credit is only given to agents with a satisfactory credit rating. Individual risk exposure limits are set based on internal and external assessments of credit ratings.
The counterparties to the derivative contracts and cash transactions are limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings. The group has routines that limit exposure to credit risk related to a single financial institution.
F-243

At 31 December 2011 a larger share of trade receivables than normal was due but not impaired. This is primarily due to additional compensation from the Norwegian government still pending a decision on an ESA inquiry as to whether additional compensation from the government is contrary to EU rules on state aid. Credit risk related to the Norwegian government as a customer is considered very low. For further details on the contingent outcome see note 5 and the note about receivables and other investments (note 12). In addition, there is an increase in outstanding trade receivables in relation to the group's concluded operations in Australia. Hurtigruten's Australian subsidiary, Hurtigruten Pty Ltd, has filed an arbitration case against the contracting party concerning outstanding claims in connection with the leasing of MS Finnmarken. Hurtigruten is considered to have a good case but, following the prudence principle, has chosen to make a provision of NOK 46 million at 31 December 2011. For further details on the contingent outcome see note 5.

(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk management includes maintaining a sufficient level of liquid assets, and ensuring the availability of sufficient funding from committed credit facilities. The group has a group account that ensures that part of the group's free liquidity is available to the parent company, thus minimising the risk of internal factors affecting the group's liquidity.

4.2 Risk related to asset management
The group's long-term goal for asset management is to ensure continued operation, and thereby ensure future dividends for shareholders. Furthermore, the object is to maintain an optimal capital structure, and thereby reduce the group's capital costs. There has been no significant change in the group's asset management from 2010 to 2011.
In order to maintain and improve the capital structure, the group has no plans for declaring dividends or repaying capital to shareholders in the short term. As part of the group's asset management, and part of the restructuring plan adopted and implemented in the period 2008­2011, the group has focused on disposing of entities defined as non-core business activities, and on completing a share issue in early 2009. The group has an opportunistic stance on the divestiture of entities defined as non-core business activities. No additional share issues have been planned for the short and medium terms.
The group monitors capital structure on the basis of, inter alia, equity ratio. This ratio is calculated as equity divided by total assets and was, at 31 December 2011, at 26.0 per cent (31 December 2010: 26.1 per cent).
The group has a convertible bond loan at a total of NOK 48.4 million, which is recognised as equity in accordance with the group's loan agreements. Including the convertible bond loan the equity ratio was 26.7 per cent at 31 December 2011. The company meets the requirements for equity in the loan agreements (note 17).

NOTE 5 CONTINGENCIES
At 31 December 2011, the group had contingent liabilities relating to bank guarantees and other guarantees, in addition to other contingent outcomes in the course of regular operations. Significant liabilities are not expected to arise with respect to contingent outcomes with the exception of the provisions that have already been set aside in the accounts (note 20).

Membership in the NOx Fund
NOK 13.4 million in nitrogen oxide tax was charged to the annual accounts for 2011 (2010: NOK 14.0 million). Members of the industrial fund for nitrogen oxides have collectively undertaken to reduce emissions of these gases by 18,000 tonnes in total, broken down into 2,000 tonnes in 2008, 4,000 tonnes in 2009 and 12,000 tonnes in 2010. A new environmental agreement relating to NOx for the period from 2011 to 2017 was signed on 14 December 2010. The signatories of the environmental agreement for the period from 2011 to 2017 have undertaken to reduce their overall nitrogen oxide emissions by 16,000 tonnes and to maintain the emission reductions achieved for the entire period. During this period the agreement has annual and biennial targets that are to be met, broken down into 3,000 tonnes in 2011, 2,000 tonnes in 2012, 4,000 tonnes in 2013 and 2014, 4,000 tonnes in 2015 and 2016 and 3,000 tonnes in 2017.
The Norwegian Climate and Pollution Agency will monitor that the Fund reaches its collective targets. If these targets are not met, the members may be required to pay the full amount of the tax on their respective share of the emissions. This requirement will be calculated on the basis of the percentage of the collective target that has not been achieved. The Fund has achieved its targets for the period from 2008 to 2010. The NOx Fund has disclosed on its website that if all of the planned measures are implemented as intended until the end of 2011, the affiliated companies will meet their overall commitments for 2011 with a high level of probability.
Supplementary Agreement in connection with the public procurement contract for the Bergen to Kirkenes coastal service
The Norwegian authorities agreed in 2004 on a contract with Hurtigruten ASA for the delivery of transport services along the Norwegian coast from Bergen to Kirkenes for the period from 2005 to 2012. This contract was awarded based on competitive tendering. In October 2008 it was decided to increase the compensation to Hurtigruten ASA for the remaining term of the contract by refunding 90 per cent of the NOx payments, general compensation due to higher costs and allowing a reduction in the number of ships from 11 to 10 in the winter for the remaining term of the contract. The Ministry of Transport and Communications has assumed that the additional grant is in line with state aid policies.
In July 2010 the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) decided to formally investigate in order to verify whether the supplementary agreement entered into in 2008 is in accordance with the EEA's rules for state aid. In June 2011 the ESA concluded that the additional compensation had not been granted in accordance with the EEA's rules. It was not evident from the conclusion what portion of the supplementary agreement the ESA believed to represent illegal state aid.
At 31 December 2011 Hurtigruten had recognised income of NOK 405 million (NOK 89 million of which was recognised in 2011) under the supplementary agreement, including the effect of reducing the number of ships in the winter from 11 to 10, and received NOK 170 million of this. The government represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications has appealed the ESA's decision and declared that no portion of the additional compensation represents illegal state aid. Hurtigruten has also appealed. The ESA replied on 15 December 2011 and maintained its assertion that Hurtigruten was overcompensated during the period in question. The government represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and Hurtigruten do not share the opinion of the ESA, and the issue will be settled by the EFTA court. A hearing in the case has been scheduled for 18 April 2012. Normally it takes up to half a year before a decision is handed down. Due to the principle of prudence, Hurtigruten has set aside provisions totalling NOK 35 million with respect to the supplementary agreement at 31 December 2011. These provisions have been accounted for as a reduction in the contractual revenue and receivables from the government (note 12).
The existing contract with the government represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications expired on 31 December 2011 after Hurtigruten and the government agreed on a new contract for the Bergen to Kirkenes coastal service for the period from 2012 to 2019. The new contract entered into force on 1 January 2012.
Charter arbitration case
Hurtigruten's Australian subsidiary Hurtigruten Pty Ltd filed an arbitration case against the other contracting party for outstanding claims in connection with the charter of the MS Finnmarken. The
F-246

outstanding claim amounts to NOK 360 million. Hurtigruten believes that it has a good case, but, due to the principle of prudence, it has set aside provisions totalling NOK 46 million at 31 December 2011. The provisions have been accounted for as provisions for bad debts under other operating costs (note 12). Operating revenues for the 2011 financial year totalled NOK 667 million (note 6). It is expected that the case will be heard by the arbitration tribunal by the end of 2012.
The charter party expired on 30 October 2011. Legal charges against TIRB and Cominor
Legal charges were brought against AS TIRB and its subsidiary Cominor AS by the Troms county council in May 2009. A complaint was filed with the court of conciliation in December 2009. The Troms county council claimed that the companies have overcharged for occasional assistance, and for unforeseen and unplanned driving, for a total amount of NOK 25 million, excluding interest. The Nord Troms District Court delivered its judgment in the case on 4 January 2012 and ordered TIRB and Cominor to pay compensation of NOK 16 million to the Troms county council. The judgment has been appealed to the Court of Appeal. The companies have set aside provisions for losses for only a portion of the judgment, NOK 8 million, since the financial calculations in the judgment are disputed.

There has been a minor reclassification of the "Finance expenses--net" from the operating segment Other business to Hurtigruten Norwegian coast for 2010. This applies to interest expenses for the convertible bond loan and bond loan, which are presented now under Hurtigruten Norwegian coast.
The reporting of segment assets and liabilities is not part of the internal management reporting in the group. These are followed up primarily at the group level for significant assets and liabilities, and certain key figures (such as trade receivables) are assessed based on the status of the individual legal entities. Segment assets and liabilities are therefore not presented.
Hurtigruten Norwegian coast
This product area comprises the company's operation of the Bergen to Kirkenes coastal service in accordance with the contract with the Norwegian government represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. This service is operated using 11 ships with daily calls to 34 ports between Bergen and Kirkenes. Although passenger transport represents the greatest portion of the service, the cargo service is also substantial.
Explorer products/MS Fram
This product area includes the cruise activities in Polar waters--Antarctica, Svalbard, Greenland and cruises between Antarctica and the Arctic. The cruises are operated by the MS Fram, which was custom-built to operate in Polar waters.
Spitsbergen
Activities in Svalbard are organised under the Spitsbergen Travel group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hurtigruten ASA. The product area consists of cruise operations, year-round overnight accommodation and adventure products in Svalbard. The company owns and runs two hotels and one guest house, and the adventure products are produced by the company's own employees and local partners.
Charter
This area includes the rental (charter) of ships to the oil industry, where they are used as hotel ships. The MS Finnmarken was taken out of the coastal operations late in 2009 for preparation for a charter as a hotel ship, and it has been chartered in the Gorgon field west of Australia from 30 April 2010 to 30 October 2011. After the expiration of the charter, the ship has undergone demobilisation and a 10-year classification survey in preparation for its return to coastal service in the middle of February 2012.
Other business
This area mainly comprise the bus business, a limited portfolio of property and other activities that do not naturally fall under the other product areas. In 2010 this area also included Hurtigruten's ownership interest in freight operations.
The bus business is operated by AS TIRB, which has its head office in Finnsnes and branch offices in Narvik and Tromsø. The group also owns a small portfolio of properties, primarily through its subsidiary HRG Eiendom AS, which is partially leased by the group and partially leased to external tenants. The freight business was operated through a 50 per cent ownership interest in Nor Lines AS, and the profit or loss from these operations is classified under "Profit/(loss) before tax from discontinued business" in the income statement. This business was sold with effect from 31 December 2010. "Profit/(loss) before tax from discontinued business" also includes the company's two remaining fast ferries, which have been chartered on short-term contracts in 2010 and the first half of 2011 to a new operator for the Tromsø to Harstad service. The fast ferries were laid up in the middle of 2011, and the company is actively seeking to find interested parties in the market.
Eliminations
Eliminations in 2010 consisted primarily of the charter of the MS Fram to Spitsbergen Travel AS, as well as the subsidiary Cominor AS's excursions for Hurtigruten. Eliminations in 2011 consisted primarily of the subsidiary Cominor AS's excursions for Hurtigruten.

(b) Secondary reporting format--geographical segments
Operating revenues cannot be allocated to separate geographical segments with reliable figures. Management's monitoring of geographical segments applies only to portions of the company's revenue and is also to a large degree based on key non-financial indicators (such as the number of cruise nights).

NOTE 7 ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE AND DISCONTINUED BUSINESS
HELD-FOR-SALE
Assets and liabilities related to the group's fast ferry business are classified as held-for-sale in 2010 and 2011. The fast ferries have been chartered on short-term contracts in 2010 and until the summer of 2011. The fast ferries were laid up in the middle of 2011, and the company is actively seeking to find interested parties in the market.

The discount rate is before tax and based on the company's internal required rate of return, in addition to the observable required rate of return for comparable companies. The growth rate after 2012 is based on the average nominal price inflation.

The following impairment losses were recognised in 2011:
· impairment of damaged assets on the Hurtigruten ship the MS Nordlys as the result of a fire on board in September 2011, totalling NOK 39 million

F-251

· impairment of fast ferries as a result of the fact that the ferries have been chartered out for parts of the year, totalling NOK 8 million
· impairment of the vehicle fleet related to the bus operations, totalling NOK 13 million

Lease agreements
The group leases premises from the subsidiary HRG Eiendom AS as well as the associate ANS Havnebygningen. In addition, the parent company and subsidiaries also have external rental costs related to premises, and a subsidiary had chartered a vessel in 2010. The parent company's charter of Hurtigruten ships has been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements (sale-leaseback agreement with two limited partnerships), and reference is made to note 20 concerning the details of this agreement. Furthermore, the parent company and subsidiaries have external costs related to the rental of other equipment and means of transport. These are operating leases.

Total rental costs related to the above comprise:

Goodwill has arisen in connection with business acquisitions. Other intangible assets consists primarily of capitalised development expenses related to ICT systems (booking, inventory systems, etc.) with a limited lifespan. The assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 3­10 years. Depreciation is presented under depreciation in the accounts.
Impairment losses in 2011 are related to the bus operations (Tromsø office) as a result of the fact that Cominor lost the competitive tendering for a new contract in Tromsø and surroundings commencing on 1 February 2012. Loss of the tender will entail lower future earnings.

A summary of the allocation of goodwill at the segment level is as follows:

Assessment of fair value The level hierarchy used for the measurement of fair value is based on the following categories: · Listed price in an active market for an identical asset or liability (level 1)

F-254

· Valuation based on observable factors, either directly (price) or indirectly (derived from prices), other than listed price (used in level 1) for the asset or liability (level 2)
· Valuation based on factors not obtained from observable markets (unobservable assumptions) (level 3)

The following table presents the group's assets and liabilities measured at fair value at 31 December 2011:

The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets is based on the market prices on the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and these prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. The market price used for financial assets is the current bid price, and the price used for financial liabilities is the current asking price. These instruments are included in level 1 and comprise the fair value of forward bunker oil contracts and other securities.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by means of various valuation methods. The group uses various methods and makes assumptions based on the prevailing market conditions on the balance sheet date. If all the significant data inputs that are required to determine the fair value of an instrument are observable data, then the instrument will be included in level 2. This includes the fair value of interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The nominal value less impairment for losses incurred on trade receivables and the nominal value of trade payables are assumed to approximate the fair value of the items.
If one or more of the significant data inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument will be included in level 3.

F-255

Special valuation methods that are used to assess financial instruments include:
· Quoted market or trading price for corresponding instruments.
· Fair value of interest rate swap contracts is calculated as the present value of the future cash flow based on the observable yield curve.
· Fair value of forward contracts in a foreign currency is calculated as the present value of the difference between the agreed forward price and the forward price on the balance sheet date multiplied by the contract volume in a foreign currency. The relevant interest rate on the balance sheet date is used for calculation of the present value.
· Other methods, such as discounted cash flows, are used to determine the fair value of the remaining financial instruments.

NOTE 11B CREDITWORTHINESS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
Hurtigruten does not have a system that distinguishes between trade receivables and other receivables based on the counterparty's creditworthiness.

NOTE 11C DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
All derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are booked at fair value on the balance sheet, while changes in the fair value are recognised temporarily in the hedging reserve in equity and recognised in the income statement when the hedged cash flow is recognised in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of trading derivatives are recognised as finance income or finance expenses.

Fair value is calculated based on the mid-price set by the contract counterparty based on current prices in the market on the reporting date.

The table below illustrates the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and derivatives held for trading purposes.

Derivatives held for trading purposes are classified as current assets or liabilities. The entire fair value of hedging instruments is classified as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity exceeds 12 months, and as a current asset or current liability if the remaining maturity is less than 12 months.

No ineffectiveness was recordable for any of the cash flow hedges in 2010 or 2011. All the forecasted cash flows hedged in 2011 continue to qualify for hedge accounting.

a) Forward foreign exchange contracts
The nominal amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2011 was NOK 465 million (2010: NOK 1,264 million).

The hedged, highly probable transactions denominated in a foreign currency are expected to occur at various

dates over the next 12 months. The forward foreign exchange contracts mature during the period from July to

September, when most of the hedged cash flow is expected to occur. The forward foreign exchange contracts

satisfy

the

requirements

for

hedge

accounting

under

IFRS

and

F-257

changes in the fair value are recognised directly in the hedging reserve in equity. Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts that are recognised in equity at 31 December 2011 (note 16), will be recognised in the income statement in the same accounting periods that the hedged transactions affect the profit or loss. The gains or losses realised are allocated to passenger revenues.

(b) Interest rate swaps
The nominal principal on outstanding interest rate swaps at 31 December 2011 was NOK 341 million (2010: NOK 300 million).
At 31 December 2011 the fixed rate ranged from 3.87 to 5.31 per cent (2011: 5.31 per cent). The floating interest rates were NIBOR. Gains or losses on interest rate swaps recorded directly in equity at 31 December 2011 (note 16), will continuously be reversed in the income statement until the bank borrowings (note 17) have been repaid. The gains or losses realised are allocated to interest expenses.

c) Oil derivatives
The nominal amount of outstanding forward bunker oil contracts at 31 December 2011 was NOK 150 million (2010: NOK 94 million).
The hedged, highly probable transactions denominated in a foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates over the next 12 months. The forward contracts mature monthly. Forward bunker oil contracts satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting under IFRS and changes in the fair value are recognised directly in equity on a current basis. Gains or losses on bunker oil derivatives recognised directly in equity at 31 December 2011 (note 16), will be recognised in the income statement in the same accounting periods that the hedged transactions affect the profit or loss. The gains or losses realised are allocated to bunker costs.

At 31 December 2011 trade receivables totalling NOK 472.2 million were overdue after provision for impairment of doubtful receivables (31 December 2010: NOK 383.8 million). Receivables overdue by up to three months are higher than in 2010. This is attributed primarily to the group's activities in Australia, which have ended (note 5).
Receivables overdue by more than six months primarily concern additional compensation from the government, which has not been settled pending the outcome of the ESA case concerning whether the additional compensation is contrary to the EU rules on state aid (note 5).

Due to the principle of prudence it has been decided to set aside provisions totalling NOK 46 million at 31 December 2011. This is in reference to Hurtigruten's Australian subsidiary Hurtigruten Pty Ltd, which has filed an arbitration case against the other contracting party for outstanding claims in connection with the charter of the MS Finnmarken (note 5).
The other classes of trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.

Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares. The company has a category of potential shares that may entail dilution, convertible bond loan. It is assumed that the convertible bond loan will not be converted to ordinary shares based on the current share price. No adjustment of the convertible bond loan will therefore be made in this context.
The diluted earnings per share will thus be identical to the earnings per share for 2010 and 2011.

Dividend per share No dividend was paid for 2010, and no dividend has been proposed for the 2011 financial year.

Hurtigruten ASA borrows primarily at variable interest rates, and interest rate swap contracts are used for the portion of the borrowings that are to have a fixed interest rate, as dictated by policy. For further information on the hedging instruments, see note 11C (Derivative financial instruments).
The fair value is based on discounting cash flows from borrowings by a discount rate based on the market's expectations of the future variable interest rates or the agreed fixed rate. The average discount rate for 2011 is 5 per cent (2010: 5 per cent).
The fair value of current borrowings corresponds to the carrying amount as the effect of the discount is insignificant.
The fair value of the convertible bond loan is estimated by adding the equity component, which is recognised separately in the accounts based on the rules for embedded options, to the carrying amount of the loan, and the cash flow from the loan is discounted at a fixed rate of 10 per cent.

The carrying amount of the group's borrowings in different currencies is as follows:

The company has financial covenants for portions of its borrowings.
The financial covenants are listed below:
· The working capital including unused credit facilities must be positive.
· The group must maintain free liquidity of at least NOK 200 million over the term of the loan.
· EBITDA must be greater than the group's annual debt obligation and dividend payments, or the group's free liquidity including unused credit facilities must be a minimum of NOK 350 million.
· The equity ratio must be 25 per cent from 30 September 2010 to the end of the loan term. At 31 December 2011, the equity requirement has been reduced (waived) temporarily to 23 per cent. The convertible bond loan issued by Hurtigruten ASA is regarded as equity in relation to the loan agreements.
An addendum to the loan agreement was signed with the bank syndicate that had financed the Hurtigruten ships in February 2009. The addendum specifies that no instalments will be paid on the loan between March 2009 and December 2011. The postponed instalments will be paid back on a pro rata basis together with the remaining instalments due for payment from March 2012. The revised loan agreement contains a cash sweep clause, which implies that Hurtigruten is committed from the first quarter of 2010 to devote all unrestricted cash that exceeds NOK 500 million at the end of the first quarter of each year for repayment of the loan. A repayment made under the cash sweep clause can only be drawn down again under the loan agreement by an amount equal to 50 per cent of the repayment made in the first quarter of 2010. No such drawdown right exists for a repayment made under the cash sweep clause in the first quarter of 2011. The cash sweep clause also encompasses the limited partnerships Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS with respect to their proportionate share of the outstanding debt. There have been no repayments under the cash sweep clause in 2010, nor have there been any such repayments in the first quarter of 2011. Hurtigruten has refinanced the aforementioned loan agreement. The refinancing was completed in March 2012.
The bond loan is irredeemable until it matures in March 2012, and the loan has a fixed interest rate of 10 per cent.
The merged company TFDS ASA issued 150,000 convertible bonds with an interest rate of 7 per cent at a nominal value of NOK 150 million on 15 June 2004.
F-265

The term to maturity was five years from the issue date. The loan was irredeemable and should have been paid back in full on 8 June 2009. The bondholder alternatively had the right to convert the bonds to ordinary shares in Hurtigruten ASA at a conversion price of NOK 101.57 per share.
In connection with the financial restructuring approved and completed in 2009, the terms of the convertible bond loan were amended. Repayment of the loan was extended by 36 months and a new maturity date of 8 June 2012 was set. The loan will be irredeemable until its final maturity date, and no interest will be charged on the loan from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009. From 1 January 2010, the interest rate will be 7 per cent per year, payable on the repayment date for the convertible bond loan.
As an alternative to retaining their interests in the convertible bond loan on the revised terms described above, bondholders were given the right to redeem or buy back bonds in the convertible bond loan by subscribing for new shares at the proposed subscription price in the private offering for an amount equal to 50 per cent of the nominal value of the bonds held by the bondholder in question, with the remaining 50 per cent to be placed in a new bond loan issued by Hurtigruten ASA against a contribution in cash. As a result, the company bought back bonds at a value of NOK 53.5 million through the private offering and an additional NOK 48.1 million through the subsequent repair issue.
The conversion price for the new convertible bond loan was NOK 20.70 per share.
The fair value of the debt component and the component related to the equity conversion was determined when the loan was issued. The fair value of the debt component, which is included in the non-current liabilities, is calculated using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible loan. The residual amount, which represents the value of the equity component, is recognised in equity under other equity not recognised in the income statement.

The convertible bond loan is recognised in the balance sheet as follows:

The loan's interest expenses are calculated based on the effective interest rate method by using an effective interest rate of 10 per cent for the debt component.
Hurtigruten ASA has refinanced its debt, and the new loan agreement with the banks is dated 7 March 2012. The agreement for a total of NOK 2.6 billion is with a bank syndicate consisting of eight banks, two of which are foreign banks. The loan has a term of five years with annual instalments of NOK 260 million, which will fall due for the first time in September 2012. The financial covenants are as follows:
· The working capital including unused credit facilities must be positive.
· The group must maintain free liquidity of at least NOK 200 million over the term of the loan.
· EBITDA must be greater than the group's annual debt obligation and dividend payments, or the group's free liquidity including unused credit facilities must be a minimum of NOK 350 million.
· An equity ratio of 22.5 per cent from 31 March 2012 to 31 December 2014, inclusive. From 31 December 2014 until the expiration of the agreement term the equity ratio requirement will increase to 25 per cent. The convertible bond loan issued by Hurtigruten ASA is regarded as equity in relation to the loan agreements.
F-266

As part of its refinancing Hurtigruten ASA has issued an unsecured bond loan of NOK 500 million. The loan has a term of five years and one month. The financial covenants are as follows:
· The working capital including unused credit facilities must be positive.
· The group must maintain free liquidity of at least NOK 200 million over the term of the loan.
· Non-current interest-bearing liabilities shall be less than 65 per cent of the total assets until 30 June 2013. This shall be reduced annually by 5 per cent at 1 July 2013. At 1 July 2015 to the expiration of the term of the agreement, non-current interest-bearing liabilities shall be lower than 50 per cent of the totals assets.
· EBITDA shall be lower than 6.5 in relation to the interest-bearing liabilities from 31 December 2013, and this shall be reduced by 0.5 annually.

The deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards are recognised on the balance sheet when it is probable that the group can apply the carryforward loss against future taxable income. In preparing the annual financial statements the management has found that the future taxable income is adequate to utilise the recognised tax loss carryforward. This assessment has been made based on the management's estimates of future profits in the group, in which particular importance has been attached, for example, to the group's procurement contract with the government in effect until 2019 inclusive, as well as the effects of the restructuring carried out by the group. The tax loss carryforward at 31 December 2011 was NOK 2,591 million (2010: NOK 2,394 million).

NOTE 19 PENSIONS

The group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. For the defined contribution

plans the cost is equal to the contributions to the employees' pension savings during the period. The future

pensions are dependent on the size of the contributions and the return on the pension plan. For the defined benefit

plans, the employer is responsible for paying the agreed pension to the employee based on his /hers final salary.

Future

defined

benefits

are

mainly

dependent

on

the

F-269

number of contribution years, salary level upon reaching retirement age and the size of the National Insurance benefits. These obligations are covered through an insurance company. In addition to the pension obligations that are covered through insurance schemes, the company has uninsured pension obligations that are funded from revenue, primarily for former key management personnel. The new Contractual Early Retirement (AFP) Scheme Act adopted by the Norwegian Parliament (Storting) in 2010 entailed the capitalisation of provisions related to the old contractual early retirement scheme and recognition in the income statement. Provisions were set aside to cover the assumed underfunding of the old contractual early retirement scheme. The new contractual early retirement scheme is regarded as a defined benefit multi-company scheme in the accounts. This means that each individual company shall account for its proportional share of the scheme's pension obligations, plan assets and pension costs. Until reliable and consistent information is available for allocation, the new contractual early retirement scheme will be accounted for as a defined contribution plan. The established pension plans cover 2,073 employees in the group. The pension costs for the period illustrate the agreed future pensions earned by employees in the financial year.

Deferred revenue recognition
A line-by-line recognition has been carried out with respect to the investment contribution received, including a possible repayment obligation. Revenue recognition of the investment contribution occurs in conjunction with depreciation of the associated asset. This year's recognised revenue is NOK 166,000. The remainder of the investment contribution at 31 December 2011 amounts to NOK 5.5 million.
Restructuring
In connection with the cost reduction programme, provisions were set aside with respect to costs related to duplicated functions in the downsizing processes, in addition to costs related to the divestment of offices, companies and other functions. Around half of the planned processes were carried out in 2009, and the rest were carried out in 2010. The remainder of the provisions, NOK 15 million, was recognised in 2010 in connection with the execution of the workforce reduction and divestment process.
Legal dispute
Legal charges were brought against AS TIRB and its subsidiary Cominor AS by the Troms county council in May 2009. A complaint was filed with the court of conciliation in December 2009. The Troms county council claimed that the companies have overcharged for occasional assistance, and for unforeseen and unplanned driving, for a total amount of NOK 25 million, excluding interest. The Nord Troms District Court delivered its judgment in the case on 4 January 2012 and ordered TIRB and Cominor to pay compensation of NOK 16 million to the Troms county council. The judgment has been appealed to the Court of Appeal. The companies have set aside provisions for losses for only a portion of the judgment, NOK 8 million, since the financial calculations in the judgment are disputed.

Share value based remuneration (synthetic options)
In 2010 the company established a share-based option scheme for all permanent employees of Hurtigruten ASA and wholly owned subsidiaries who owned shares in Hurtigruten ASA at 31 December 2010. It is a share value based remuneration programme in which the employees receive cash instead of shares (synthetic options). Reference is made to note 21 for further details.
Investment obligations
The group has no contractual investments at the balance sheet date.
Operating lease commitments--group company as lessee
The group leases an office in Tromsø, in addition to some other offices. These leases have varying payment dates, price adjustment clauses and renewal rights. The group also leases machinery and transport equipment. Leasing costs for the year are specified in note 8. The group has no non-cancellable leases.
The parent company entered into contracts in December 2002 and June 2003 to sell and charter back the Hurtigruten vessels the MS Richard With and MS Nordlys. These ships were sold to Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, respectively, and chartered back for a period of 15 years with an option for an additional 5 years on market terms. For the first 15 years the charter hire payments consist of three components; fixed hire in NOK, fixed hire in USD/EUR and a variable element in USD/EUR.
In the consolidated financial statements Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS are consolidated in accordance with IFRS SIC-12 on special purpose entities. Recognised bareboat charter hire payments in the income statement of the parent company have thus been eliminated against charter hire income in the limited partnerships in connection with the consolidation.
Hurtigruten ASA will undertake and pay for the operation, insurance and all necessary ongoing maintenance of the vessels. In the charter agreements between the limited partnerships and Hurtig-ruten ASA, identical requirements (financial covenants) have been stipulated for Hurtigruten ASA for the duration of the agreements, which the company has as a component of its long-term loan agreements linked to vessels. Reference is made to note 17 with regard to these financial covenants.
A breach of the financial covenants may entail a termination of the charter agreements by the lessor. The group has satisfied all the financial covenants at 31 December 2011.
In connection with the financial restructuring in February 2009, an addendum to the charter agreement was agreed on with the limited partnerships Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, which entailed that the instalment component of the charter hire under the charterparties with the two limited partnerships will not be payable until 31 December 2011. The postponed instalments will, however, be added to the instalments to be paid in 2012 and 2013, thereby reverting to the original repayment plan in August 2013. For their proportionate shares of the outstanding debt, the limited partnerships will receive any payments that are made under the cash sweep clause for the banks, as described in note 17. An increase in the charter hire was also agreed to compensate for the increased costs incurred by the limited partnerships under their loan agreements because of the changes in the repayment profile. In addition, it has been agreed that Hurtigruten's option to buy back the MS Nordlys and MS Richard With will be cancelled. No instalment payments have been made under the cash sweep clause in 2011. In the first quarter of 2011 Hurtigruten ASA has made extraordinary instalment payments on the bare-boat charter hire. The extraordinary instalment payments have been made through the release of funds that were restricted as security for the charter agreement. The payments have been used in their entirety for an extraordinary repayment of borrowings in the two limited partnerships.

NOTE 21 SHARE VALUE BASED REMUNERATION
Hurtigruten would like to encourage its employees to invest in their own company through an incentive scheme. The purpose of this scheme is to make Hurtigruten a more attractive place to work in the long term and raise awareness of shareholder value and profitability, as well as encourage behaviour that will increase shareholder value in the company over time. An option scheme was offered to all the permanent employees of Hurtigruten ASA and wholly owned subsidiaries who owned shares in Hurtigruten ASA at 31 December 2010.
For each share the employee owned on 31 December 2010, the employee would receive three options. The executive management and personnel reporting directly to the CEO may participate with up to 83,333 shares (for a total of 250,000 share options), employees who report directly to a member of the executive management can participate with up to 33,333 shares (for a total of 100,000 share options) and all other employees can participate with up to 8,333 shares (for a total of 25,000 share options).
The programme is structured as a synthetic share option programme, in which the options can be exercised over the next three years. In December 2011, 20 per cent of the options can be exercised; in December 2012, 30 per cent of the options can be exercised; and, in December 2013, 50 per cent of the options can be exercised. The market price will be the average market price in December for the respective years. The average market price for the second half of 2010, which was NOK 4.01, will be used as the basis for calculating gains. The number of shares held on 31 December 2010 must be kept until the options are exercised. Any gains will be distributed as an extraordinary bonus without any right to holiday pay after the end of each year. The employees will pay ordinary income tax on the gain.

Movements in the number of outstanding share options and the associated weighted average exercise prices are as follows:

2011
Average exercise price in Options NOK per share (in thousands)

2010
Average exercise price in Options NOK per share (in thousands)

The most important input data includes the share price at 31 December 2011 of NOK 3.03 (NOK 4.88 at 31 December 2010), exercise prices listed above, the standard deviation of the expected share price return of 59 per cent (39 per cent in 2010), and the annual riskfree interest rate of 1.31 per cent (2.34 per cent in 2010). Volatility is measured using the standard deviation of the expected return based on a statistical analysis of the daily share prices in 2011.

F-275

The fair value is recognised as an expense under payroll costs over the vesting period. A total of NOK 0.3 million and NOK 0.6 million was recognised as an expense in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The average price in December for the next three years will be measured against the average price for the second the half of 2010, which was NOK 4.01. The average price in December 2011 was NOK 3.13, and thus there was no calculation of a gain or distributions for 2011.

(1) CFO contracted from an external company. The fees include travel costs and a telephone and home PC allowance. CFO receives only fees and is not included in the company's other benefit programmes.

(2) Rood's salary is paid in USD and translated to NOK. (3) Fees exclusive of value added tax. (4) Salaries, fees and directors' remuneration have been paid from the management company Hurtigruten Pluss AS, except the directors
elected by the employees, which have been paid by Hurtigruten ASA. (5) Includes bonus based on approved accounts for 2011 (payable in 2012), and estimated costs related to the share value based
remuneration programme.
The company's chief executive, Olav Fjell, has a contract with the company stipulating an annual salary of NOK 4.3 million. Other benefits include a company car and an ordinary telephone, internet, newspaper and home PC allowance. He is also entitled to a bonus as determined by the company's board. The board is free to consider whether a bonus shall be paid and how much should be paid within a maximum limit of one-third of the chief executive's annual salary. The four first years that Fjell was employed the payment of a bonus was not considered. However, the board decided in the autumn of 2011 to pay a bonus of NOK 0.7 million for the years 2007 to 2011. This amount has been included under other remuneration above. The chief executive's conditions of employment do not include any personal pension obligations.
When Fjell was appointed as the company's chief executive in September 2007, there had been a number of chief executives during a short period of time, and the board wanted to motivate Fjell to stay with the company for a number of years. The chief executive's contract of employment stipulated therefore that if the chief executive resigned of his own free will after a minimum of three year's employment, the company would continue to pay his salary for 18 months. Any other pay received from permanent positions during this period would not be deducted from the termination pay provided by Hurtigruten ASA. In the autumn of 2011, Fjell had been employed for four years and the board decided to pay the agreed termination pay as a bonus for remaining in his position for at least three years and removed the termination pay clause from his contract at the same time. The termination pay clause upon resignation at the wishes of the board was also removed, and Fjell now has an ordinary period of notice of six months without any entitlement to termination pay. The payment of NOK 6.6. million has been included in the other remuneration column above.
The company's executive management are members of the company's defined contribution plan. In addition, a supplementary pension plan has been established, which provides a pension for any salary in excess of 12 times the National Insurance basic amount (12G). This plan is an ordinary arrangement in the company, and it includes all employees, including members of the executive management, with a salary exceeding 12 times the basic amount, with the exception of the chief executive, who is not a member of any personal pension plan in the company. The pension costs for the executive management have been included under pension costs above.
The board agreed at a board meeting on 26 February 2008 to introduce a performance-based bonus scheme for the company's executive management with effect from 1 January 2008. The bonus payments are limited to one-third of each executive's annual salary, with 25 per cent of the bonus being determined by the group's overall results, and the remaining 75 per cent being determined by the results achieved in the executive's area of responsibility. Results within the executive's area of responsibility are compared with predefined targets/ parameters. The bonus scheme includes the executive management with the exception of the chief executive. The chief executive has his own bonus scheme, in which the board determines the size of the bonus. This scheme has been described above in the section on the chief executive's remuneration. Payments will be made under the bonus scheme to the executive management on the basis of the 2011 results. The payments will be made in 2012. This bonus is included under other remuneration above.
In 2010 a share value based bonus scheme (synthetic options) was established for permanent employees of Hurtigruten ASA and wholly owned subsidiaries of Hurtigruten ASA. The estimated costs for the year related to senior management covered by the plan are included under other remuneration above. Reference is made to note 21 for further details on the scheme.

STATEMENT ON THE DETERMINATION OF SALARY AND OTHER REMUNERATION FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES IN HURTIGRUTEN ASA
The following guidelines have been specified with effect from 15 February 2011:
1. Definitions 1.1 Senior executives include the chief executive and other senior executives, cf. Proposition no. 55 (2005­
2006), which refers to the provisions of the Norwegian Accounting Act and Public Limited Liability Companies Act concerning "senior executives".
1.2 In these guidelines, a compensation scheme means a remuneration package comprising one or more of the following elements: Fixed salary, variable pay (bonuses, share-based programs, options, etc.) and other benefits (pension schemes, pay guarantee schemes, fringe benefits, and the like).
1.3 Severance pay refers here to compensation related to departure from the company and may involve a pay guarantee, other financial benefits and payments in kind.
2. Main principles for determining compensation schemes 2.1 Remuneration to senior executives in Hurtigruten ASA will be competitive but not market leading
compared with similar companies. 2.2 The main element in a compensation scheme should be fixed salary. 2.3 Compensation schemes shall be formulated to avoid unreasonable benefits arising as a result of external
circumstances which the executive management cannot influence. 2.4 The individual elements in a pay package shall be assessed from an overarching perspective, with fixed
salary, possible variable pay and other benefits such as pension schemes and severance pay viewed as a whole. The board of directors shall maintain an overview of the total value of each executive's agreed compensation.
2.5 Determining guidelines for the remuneration of senior executives is the responsibility of the entire board of directors. Remuneration of the group's chief executive is determined by the board of directors.
2.6 The board of directors shall ensure that remuneration schemes for senior executives do not have unfortunate effects for the company or weaken its reputation.
2.7 Senior executives shall not receive special remuneration for serving as directors of wholly-owned subsidiaries in the same group.
2.8 Agreements entered into before these guidelines came into effect may continue.
3. Variable pay Any variable pay shall be based on the following principles: 3.1 A clear connection shall exist between the underlying goals for the variable pay and the company's
objectives. 3.2 Variable pay shall be based on objective, definable and measurable criteria. 3.3 These criteria shall be based on conditions which the executive in question can influence. 3.4 Several relevant measurable criteria should be applied. 3.5 A variable pay scheme shall be transparent and clearly understandable. Identifying the anticipated and
the maximum payment for each participant in the programme is important when explaining the scheme. 3.6 The scheme shall be of limited duration. 3.7 Total variable pay received in any year should not exceed six months of fixed salary, unless exceptional
circumstances dictate otherwise.
4. Pension schemes 4.1 Pension terms shall be equivalent to those enjoyed by other employees in the company.
F-280

4.2 To the extent that a retirement age lower than the National Insurance retirement age of 67 years is agreed, it should generally not be lower than 65.
4.3 Agreements on pensions shall be based on the same years of pensionable service as for other comparable employees in the company.
4.4 Pension entitlements earned in other positions shall be taken into account.
4.5 Pension entitlements should not exceed 66 per cent of salary. Retiring at an age younger than 65 shall result in a lower pension entitlement.
4.6 The board of directors shall obtain an overview of the total cost of a pension agreement before it is entered into.

5. Severance pay
5.1 Severance pay can be agreed when a senior executive waives their right in advance to the employment protection provisions in the Norwegian Working Environment Act. Severance pay should not be provided in the event of voluntary resignation except in special circumstances.
5.2 Severance pay should not exceed 12 months fixed salary in addition to possible pay during the period of notice.
5.3 Should the person concerned be appointed to a new position or receive remuneration from an enterprise in which they are an active owner, severance pay should be reduced by a proportionate amount calculated on the basis of the person's new annual income. Such a reduction should first be made after the normal period of notice has expired.
5.4 Severance pay may be suspended if conditions exist which would have justified dismissal or if, during the severance period, irregularities or acts of negligence are discovered which might lead to compensation claims or to criminal charges against the person concerned.

NOTE 31 EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE Refinancing of Hurtigruten's debt
On 7 March 2012 Hurtigruten ASA signed a loan agreement for NOK 2.6 billion with a bank syndicate consisting of eight Norwegian and foreign banks. Six of these banks also participated in Hurtigruten's former bank syndicate. The loan is to be repaid in annual instalments of NOK 260 million and have a term of five years with a margin of 350 basis points (3.5 per cent).
An unsecured bond loan totalling NOK 500 million was also issued on the same date. The loan has a term of five years and one month and a margin of 700 basis points (7.0 per cent).
This means that all of Hurtigruten's existing bank debt of approximately NOK 3 billion has been refinanced. This refinancing has been made possible by the operational restructuring that has taken place in recent years, the good development on the passenger side, and the new agreement with the government that takes effect on 1 January 2012 with significantly better terms than the old agreement.
The refinancing provides Hurtigruten with a prudent capital structure for the next five years with a repayment profile adapted to the company's operations and expected earnings.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Hurtigruten ASA has chosen to adopt simplified International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in its parent company accounts, pursuant to section 3­9, paragraph 5 of the Norwegian Accounting Act, cf. regulation of 21 January 2008.
Applying the simplified version of IFRS to the parent company accounts means that valuation rules and accounting policies applied in the consolidated accounts also apply to the parent company, Hurtigruten ASA. See the group accounting policies for further information. A simplified application of IFRS enables the financial statements and note information to accord with the Norwegian Accounting Act (NGAAP). The financial statements and notes for the parent company have been organised in accordance with the NGAAP, with the exception of the comprehensive income statement which follows IFRS.
Shares in subsidiaries and associates are recorded in accordance with the cost method of accounting in the parent company accounts.
NOTE 1 FINANCIAL MARKET RISK The company uses financial instruments such as bank loans, bond loans and convertible bond loans. The
purpose of these financial instruments is to raise capital for investments that are necessary for the company's activities. In addition, the company has financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables, etc., which are directly linked to the day-to-day operations. For hedging purposes the company makes use of certain financial derivatives. The company uses financial derivatives for trading purposes to a limited extent.
As a result of its regular operations, the company is exposed to risks related, for example, to fluctuations in exchange and interest rates and bunker costs. The company's overall hedging strategy is to create predictability for the company's operations and reduce the impact volatility in macro-economic conditions might have on the company's financial performance and standing. The primary management parameter is the expected net cash flow. Extensive use is made of simple, transparent and liquid hedging instruments, mainly forward contracts, combined possibly with options and corridors.
Currency risk The company operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk in multiple foreign currencies. This
risk is especially relevant in relation to the euro (EUR), US dollar (USD), pound sterling (GBP) and Australian dollar (AUD). The currency risk arises from future ticket sales and assets and liabilities recognised on the balance sheet. In addition, the bunker cost is quoted in USD. A currency risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency.
The company's strategy is to hedge 60­80 per cent of the net expected cash flow in euro one to two years into the future through the use of transparent and liquid instruments, usually forward contracts combined with foreign currency loans. For 2012, 60 per cent of the net expected cash flow in EUR has been hedged. The company completed the refinancing of its debt in March 2012. Portions of the loan can be converted from NOK to EUR in order to achieve "natural hedging". No decision has been made on the timing of the conversion.
In connection with chartering out the MS Finnmarken as a hotel ship to Boskalis Australia Pty Limited for 18 months, starting in April 2010, the company has had currency hedges for AUD corresponding to approximately 60 per cent of the expected cash flow throughout the term of the charter. The currency hedges expired at the same time as the expiration of the charter on 30 October 2011.
F-289

Forward foreign currency contracts
The nominal amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2011 was NOK 465 million (2010: NOK 1,264 million).
The hedged, highly probable transactions denominated in a foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates over the next 12 months. The forward foreign exchange contracts mature during the period from July to September, when most of the hedged cash flow is expected to occur. The forward foreign exchange contracts satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting under IFRS and changes in the fair value are recognised directly in the hedging reserve in equity. Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts that are recognised in equity at 31 December 2011, will be recognised in the income statement in the same accounting periods that the hedged transactions affect the profit or loss. The gains or losses realised are allocated to passenger revenues.
Interest rate risk
The company's interest rate risk is associated with current and non-current borrowings. Borrowings at variable interest rates entail an interest rate risk for the company's cash flow. Fixed interest rate loans expose the company to a fair value interest rate risk. In 2010 and 2011 the group's loans with variable interest rates have been in NOK.
The company manages the variable interest rate risk by means of variable to fixed interest rate swap contracts. Interest rate swap contracts entail a conversion of variable interest rate borrowings to fixed interest rate borrowings. The group enters into a contract with other parties to exchange the difference between the contract's fixed interest rate and variable interest rate calculated based on the agreed principal through the interest rate swaps. At 31 December 2011 a minor portion (around 10 per cent) of the company's debt has been hedged. In connection with Hurtigruten's refinancing of its debt in March 2012, interest rate hedges will be established for 40­60 per cent of the bank loan.
Interest rate swaps
The nominal principal on outstanding interest rate swaps at 31 December 2011 was NOK 300 million (2010: NOK 300 million).
At 31 December 2011 the fixed interest rate was 5.31 per cent (2010: 5.31 per cent). The variable interest rates were NIBOR. Gains or losses on interest rate swaps recorded directly in equity at 31 December 2011, will continuously be reversed in the income statement until the bank borrowings (note 10) have been repaid. The gains or losses realised are allocated to interest expenses.
Bunker oil
The company is exposed to fluctuations in bunker prices. The price of oil, and thus bunker oil, is determined in international trading in USD, while the parent company purchases bunker oil in NOK. The risk can therefore be split into a currency element and a product element. In its risk management strategy, the company has emphasised the need to coordinate risk, and has therefore chosen to reduce the bunkers risk while the currency risk is coordinated with the company's other currency exposures.
The company enters into revolving quarterly forward contracts for the next 4­6 quarters to hedge 20­80 per cent of the expected bunker consumption, with a greater share being hedged in the near future and less being hedged further into the future. For 2012, 48 per cent of the expected bunker consumption has been hedged, with a greater share being hedged in the first quarters and less being hedged towards the end of the year.
Oil derivatives
The nominal amount of outstanding forward bunker oil contracts at 31 December 2011 was NOK 150 million (2010: NOK 94 million).
The hedged, highly probable transactions denominated in a foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates over the next 12 months. The forward contracts mature monthly. Forward
F-290

bunker oil contracts satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting under IFRS and changes in the fair value are recognised directly in equity on a current basis. Gains or losses on bunker oil derivatives recognised directly through equity at 31 December 2011, will be recognised in the income statement in the same accounting periods that the hedged transactions affect the profit or loss. The gains or losses realised are allocated to bunker costs.
Credit risk and liquidity risk
The company is exposed to credit and liquidity risks. At 31 December 2011 there was a greater percentage of the trade receivables that were overdue, but not written down. This is attributed primarily to the additional compensation from the government that has not been settled pending the outcome of the ESA case concerning whether the additional compensation is contrary to the EU rules on state aid. The credit risk to the government as a customer is regarded as very low. This situation is discussed in greater detail in the note on contingencies (note 2) and the note on combined items (note 9).
The company's strategy with regard to liquidity is to have sufficient cash, cash equivalents or credit facilities to finance its operations and investments.
NOTE 2 CONTINGENCIES
At 31 December 2011, the company had contingent liabilities relating to bank guarantees and other guarantees, in addition to other contingent outcomes in the course of regular operations. Significant liabilities are not expected to arise with respect to contingent outcomes.
Membership in the NOx Fund
NOK 13.4 million in nitrogen oxide tax was charged to the annual accounts for 2011 (2010: NOK 14.0 million). Members of the industrial fund for nitrogen oxides have collectively undertaken to reduce emissions of these gases by 18,000 tonnes in total, broken down into 2,000 tonnes in 2008, 4,000 tonnes in 2009 and 12,000 tonnes in 2010. A new environmental agreement relating to NOx for the period from 2011 to 2017 was signed on 14 December 2010. The signatories of the environmental agreement for the period from 2011 to 2017 have undertaken to reduce their overall nitrogen oxide emissions by 16,000 tonnes and to maintain the emission reductions achieved for the entire period. During this period the agreement has annual and biennial targets that are to be met, broken down into 3,000 tonnes in 2011, 2,000 tonnes in 2012, 4,000 tonnes in 2013 and 2014, 4,000 tonnes in 2015 and 2016 and 3,000 tonnes in 2017.
The Norwegian Climate and Pollution Agency will monitor that the Fund reaches its collective targets. If these targets are not met, the members may be required to pay the full amount of the tax on their respective share of the emissions. This requirement will be calculated on the basis of the percentage of the collective target that has not been achieved. The Fund has achieved its targets for the period from 2008 to 2010. The NOx Fund has disclosed on its website that if all of the planned measures are implemented as intended until the end of 2011, the affiliated companies will meet their overall commitments for 2011 with a high level of probability.
Supplementary Agreement in connection with the public procurement contract for the Bergen to Kirkenes coastal service
The Norwegian authorities agreed in 2004 on a contract with Hurtigruten ASA for the delivery of transport services along the Norwegian coast from Bergen to Kirkenes for the period from 2005 to 2012. This contract was awarded based on competitive tendering. In October 2008 it was decided to increase the compensation to Hurtigruten ASA for the remaining term of the contract by refunding 90 per cent of the NOx payments, general compensation due to higher costs and allowing a reduction in the number of ships from 11 to 10 in the winter for the remaining term of the contract. The Ministry of Transport and Communications has assumed that the additional grant is in line with state aid policies.
In July 2010 the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) decided to formally investigate in order to verify whether the supplementary agreement entered into in 2008 is in accordance with the EEA's rules for state aid. In June 2011 the ESA concluded that the additional compensation had not been granted in accordance with the EEA's rules. It was not evident from the conclusion what portion of the supplementary agreement the ESA believed to represent illegal state aid.
F-291

At 31 December 2011 Hurtigruten had recognised income of NOK 405 million (NOK 89 million of which was recognised in 2011) under the supplementary agreement, including the effect of reducing the number of ships in the winter from 11 to 10, and received NOK 170 million of this. The government, represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, has appealed the ESA's decision and declared that no portion of the additional compensation represents illegal state aid. Hurtigruten has also appealed. The ESA replied on 15 December 2011 and maintained its assertion that Hurtigruten was overcompensated during the period in question. The government, represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and Hurtigruten do not share the opinion of the ESA, and the issue will be settled by the EFTA court. A hearing in the case has been scheduled for 18 April 2012. Normally it takes up to half a year before a decision is handed down. Due to the principle of prudence, Hurtigruten has set aside provisions totalling NOK 35 million with respect to the supplementary agreement at 31 December 2011. These provisions have been accounted for as a reduction in the contract income and receivables from the government (note 9).
The existing contract with the government, represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, expired on 31 December 2011 after Hurtigruten and the government agreed on a new contract for the Bergen to Kirkenes coastal service for the period from 2012 to 2019. The new contract entered into force on 1 January 2012.

In preparing the annual financial statements the management has found that the future taxable income is adequate to utilise the recognised tax loss carryforward. This assessment has been made based on the management's estimates of future profits in the group, in which particular importance has been attached, for example, to the company's procurement contract with the government in effect until 2019 inclusive, as well as the effects of the restructuring carried out by company.

NOTE 8B CREDITWORTHINESS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
Hurtigruten does not have a system that distinguishes between trade receivables and other receivables based on the counterparty's creditworthiness. Hurtigruten has longstanding partners, and it follows up their creditworthiness through periodic reconciliation of the trade receivables ledger and credit monitoring.

Receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to NOK at the rate in effect on the balance sheet date. The company's provisions for bad debt have increased from
F-297

NOK 96 million at 31 December 2010 to NOK 143 million at 31 December 2011. The increase in the provisions for bad debt are attributed to the fact that Hurtigruten's Australian subsidiary Hurtigruten Pty Ltd filed an arbitration case against the other contracting party for outstanding claims in connection with the charter of the MS Finnmarken. Due to the principle of prudence provisions have been set aside totalling NOK 46 million at 31 December 2011 (note 2).
The increase in trade receivables is attributed primarily to the additional compensation from the government that has not been settled pending the outcome of the ESA case concerning whether the additional compensation is contrary to the EU rules on state aid. The reduction in other current receivables is attributed primarily to the settlement for the sale of the shares in Nor Lines and accounting provisions of NOK 35 million concerning the supplementary agreement (note 2).
The increase in the first-year instalments is attributed to the fact that the deferred instalment agreement expired on 31 December 2011 (note 10).

The convertible bond loan of NOK 47 million (debt element at the balance sheet date) and a bond loan of NOK 51 million are included above. Deferred tax and pension obligations are not included above.
Hurtigruten ASA entered into an agreement in September 2006 with a bank syndicate headed by Nordea comprising a revolving credit facility of up to NOK 3,300 million, which permitted the repayment of current loans for the financing of Hurtigruten and for external financing of the MS Fram. An addendum to the loan agreement was signed in February 2009. The addendum specifies that no instalments will be paid on the loan between March 2009 and December 2011. The postponed instalments will be paid back on a pro rata basis together with the remaining instalments due for payment from March 2012. The revised loan agreement contains a cash sweep clause, which implies that Hurtigruten is committed from the first quarter of 2010 to devote all unrestricted cash that exceeds NOK 500 million at the end of the first quarter of each year for repayment of the loan. A repayment made under the cash sweep clause can only be drawn down again under the loan agreement by an amount equal to 50 per cent of the repayment made in the first quarter of 2010. No such drawdown right exists for a repayment made under the cash sweep clause in the first quarter of 2011. There have been no repayments under the cash sweep clause in 2010, nor have there been any such repayments in the first quarter of 2011.

F-298

The loan agreement specifies financial covenants related to liquidity, equity and cash flow. These covenants must be met at the end of every quarter, and the required minimum free liquidity of NOK 200 million must be maintained during the term of the loan. The financial covenants are as follows:
· The working capital including unused credit facilities must be positive.
· The group must maintain free liquidity of at least NOK 200 million over the term of the loan.
· EBITDA must be greater than the group's annual debt obligation and dividend payments, or the group's free liquidity including unused credit facilities must be a minimum of NOK 350 million.
· The equity ratio must be 25 per cent from 30 September 2010 to the end of the loan term. At 31 December 2011, the equity requirement has been reduced (waived) temporarily to 23 per cent. The convertible bond loan issued by Hurtigruten ASA is regarded as equity in relation to the loan agreements.
Hurtigruten ASA has refinanced its debt, and the new loan agreement with the banks is dated 7 March 2012. The agreement for a total of NOK 2.6 billion is with a bank syndicate consisting of eight banks, two of which are foreign banks. The term of the loan is five years with annual instalments of NOK 260 million and the first instalment falls due in September 2012. The financial covenants are as follows:
· The working capital including unused credit facilities must be positive.
· The group must maintain free liquidity of at least NOK 200 million over the term of the loan.
· EBITDA must be greater than the group's annual debt obligation and dividend payments, or the group's free liquidity including unused credit facilities must be a minimum of NOK 350 million.
· An equity ratio of 22.5 per cent from 31 March 2012 to 31 December 2014, inclusive. From 31 December 2014 until the expiration of the agreement term the equity ratio requirement will increase to 25 per cent. The convertible bond loan issued by Hurtigruten ASA is regarded as equity in relation to the loan agreements.
As part of its refinancing Hurtigruten ASA has issued an unsecured bond loan of NOK 500 million. The loan has a term of five years and one month. The financial covenants are as follows:
· The working capital including unused credit facilities must be positive.
· The group must maintain free liquidity of at least NOK 200 million over the term of the loan.
· Non-current interest-bearing liabilities shall be less than 65 per cent of the total assets until 30 June 2013. This shall be reduced annually by 5 per cent at 1 July 2013. At 1 July 2015 to the expiration of the term of the agreement, non-current interest-bearing liabilities shall be less than 50 per cent of the total assets.
· EBITDA shall be lower than 6.5 in relation to the interest-bearing liabilities from 31 December 2013, and this shall be reduced by 0.5 annually.

NOTE 14 PENSIONS
The company has pension plans that give entitlement to defined future pension benefits. These are mainly dependent on the number of years of service, salary level upon reaching retirement age, and the size of the National Insurance benefits. These obligations are funded through an insurance company. The defined benefit pension plans cover 1,285 employees in the parent company. For maritime personnel there are three pension plans that cover different pension periods. A defined benefit plan that covers the period from age 60 to 67, and a defined contribution plan through an insurance company that covers pensions after reaching the age of 67. In addition to the pension obligations funded through insurance companies, the company has defined contribution plans for maritime personnel (Norwegian Pension Insurance for Seafarers) which are administrated by the government. The company also has an unfunded plan funded from revenue.

(1) CFO contracted from an external company. The fees include travel costs and a telephone and home PC allowance. CFO receives only fees and is not included in the company's other benefit programmes.
(2) Rood's salary is paid in USD and translated to NOK. (3) Fees exclusive of value added tax. (4) Salaries, fees and directors' remuneration have been paid from the management company Hurtigruten Pluss AS, except for the board
members elected by the employees, which have been paid by Hurtigruten ASA. (5) Includes bonus based on accounts for 2011 (payable in 2012), and estimated costs related to the share value based remuneration
programme.

The company's chief executive, Olav Fjell, has a contract with the company stipulating an annual salary of NOK 4.3 million. Other benefits include a company car and an ordinary telephone, internet, newspaper and home PC allowance. He is also entitled to a bonus as determined by the company's board. The board is free to consider whether a bonus shall be paid and how much should be paid within a maximum limit of one-third of the chief executive's annual salary. The four first years that Fjell was employed the payment of a bonus was not considered. However, the board decided in the autumn of 2011 to pay a bonus of NOK 0.7 million for the years 2007 to 2011. This amount has been included under other remuneration above. The chief executive's conditions of employment do not include any personal pension obligations.

F-306

When Fjell was appointed as the company's chief executive in September 2007, there had been a number of chief executives during a short period of time, and the board wanted to motivate Fjell to stay with the company for a number of years. The chief executive's contract of employment stipulated therefore that if the chief executive resigned of his own free will after a minimum of three year's employment, the company would continue to pay his salary for 18 months. Any other pay received from permanent positions during this period would not be deducted from the termination pay provided by Hurtigruten ASA. In the autumn of 2011, Fjell had been employed for four years and the board decided to pay the agreed termination pay as a bonus for remaining in his position for at least three years and removed the termination pay clause from his contract at the same time. The termination pay clause upon resignation at the wishes of the board was also removed, and Fjell now has an ordinary period of notice of six months without any entitlement to termination pay. The payment of NOK 6.6 million has been included in the other remuneration column above.
The company's executive management are members of the company's defined contribution plan. In addition, a supplementary pension plan has been established, which provides a pension for any salary in excess of 12 times the National Insurance basic amount (12G). This plan is an ordinary arrangement in the company, and it includes all employees, including members of the executive management, with a salary exceeding 12 times the basic amount, with the exception of the chief executive, who is not a member of any personal pension plan in the company. The pension costs for the executive management have been included under pension costs above.
The board agreed at a board meeting on 26 February 2008 to introduce a performance-based bonus scheme for the company's executive management with effect from 1 January 2008. The bonus payments are limited to one-third of each executive's annual salary, with 25 per cent of the bonus being determined by the group's overall results, and the remaining 75 per cent being determined by the results achieved in the executive's area of responsibility. Results within the executive's area of responsibility are compared with predefined targets/ parameters. The bonus scheme includes the executive management with the exception of the chief executive. The chief executive has his own bonus scheme, in which the board determines the size of the bonus. This scheme has been described above in the section on the chief executive's remuneration. Payments will be made under the bonus scheme to the executive management on the basis of the 2011 results. The payments will be made in 2012. This bonus is included under other remuneration above.
In 2010 a share value based bonus scheme (synthetic options) was established for permanent employees of Hurtigruten ASA and wholly owned subsidiaries of Hurtigruten ASA. This scheme includes only permanent employees who owned shares in Hurtigruten ASA at 31 December 2010. For each share the employee owned on 31 December 2010, the employee would receive three synthetic options. The executive management may participate with up to 83,333 shares (for a total of 250,000 share options). The options may be exercised over the next three years. In December 2011, 20 per cent of the options can be exercised; in December 2012, 30 per cent of the options can be exercised; and, in December 2013, 50 per cent of the options can be exercised. The market price will be the average market price in December for the respective years. The number of shares at 31 December 2010 must be kept until the options are exercised. Any gains will be paid as an extraordinary bonus after the end of each year. The employees will pay ordinary income tax on any gain.
The fair value of the options is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period. A total of NOK 0.3 million was recognised as an expense (payroll costs) for 2011 and provisions totalling NOK 0.9 million have been set aside (provisions for liabilities). The average price in December for the next three years will be measured against the average price for the second the half of 2010, which was NOK 4. A total of 1.3 million shares are included in the option scheme, which gives a total of 3.9 million options. There have been no payments under this scheme in 2011. The estimated costs for the year related to senior management personnel participating in the scheme are included under other remuneration above. Reference is made to note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the scheme.

STATEMENT ON THE DETERMINATION OF SALARY AND OTHER REMUNERATION FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES IN HURTIGRUTEN ASA
The following guidelines have been specified with effect from 15 February 2011:
1. Definitions 1.1 Senior executives include the chief executive and other senior executives, cf. Proposition no. 55 (2005­
2006), which refers to the provisions of the Norwegian Accounting Act and Public Limited Liability Companies Act concerning "senior executives".
1.2 In these guidelines, a compensation scheme means a remuneration package comprising one or more of the following elements: Fixed salary, variable pay (bonuses, share-based programs, options, etc.) and other benefits (pension schemes, pay guarantee schemes, fringe benefits, and the like).
1.3 Severance pay refers here to compensation related to departure from the company and may involve a pay guarantee, other financial benefits and payments in kind.
2. Main principles for determining compensation schemes 2.1 Remuneration to senior executives in Hurtigruten ASA will be competitive but not market leading
compared with similar companies. 2.2 The main element in a compensation scheme should be fixed salary. 2.3 Compensation schemes shall be formulated to avoid unreasonable benefits arising as a result of external
circumstances which the executive management cannot influence. 2.4 The individual elements in a pay package shall be assessed from an overarching perspective, with fixed
salary, possible variable pay and other benefits such as pension schemes and severance pay viewed as a whole. The board of directors shall maintain an overview of the total value of each executive's agreed compensation.
2.5 Determining guidelines for the remuneration of senior executives is the responsibility of the entire board of directors. Remuneration of the group's chief executive is determined by the board of directors.
2.6 The board of directors shall ensure that remuneration schemes for senior executives do not have unfortunate effects for the company or weaken its reputation.
2.7 Senior executives shall not receive special remuneration for serving as directors of wholly-owned subsidiaries in the same group.
2.8 Agreements entered into before these guidelines came into effect may continue.
3. Variable pay Any variable pay shall be based on the following principles: 3.1 A clear connection shall exist between the underlying goals for the variable pay and the company's
objectives. 3.2 Variable pay shall be based on objective, definable and measurable criteria. 3.3 These criteria shall be based on conditions which the executive in question can influence. 3.4 Several relevant measurable criteria should be applied. 3.5 A variable pay scheme shall be transparent and clearly understandable. Identifying the anticipated and
the maximum payment for each participant in the programme is important when explaining the scheme. 3.6 The scheme shall be of limited duration. 3.7 Total variable pay received in any year should not exceed six months of fixed salary, unless exceptional
circumstances dictate otherwise.
F-309

4. Pension schemes
4.1 Pension terms shall be equivalent to those enjoyed by other employees in the company.
4.2 To the extent that a retirement age lower than the National Insurance retirement age of 67 years is agreed, it should generally not be lower than 65.
4.3 Agreements on pensions shall be based on the same years of pensionable service as for other comparable employees in the company.
4.4 Pension entitlements earned in other positions shall be taken into account.
4.5 Pension entitlements should not exceed 66 per cent of salary. Retiring at an age younger than 65 shall result in a lower pension entitlement.
4.6 The board of directors shall obtain an overview of the total cost of a pension agreement before it is entered into.

5. Severance pay
5.1 Severance pay can be agreed when a senior executive waives their right in advance to the employment protection provisions in the Norwegian Working Environment Act. Severance pay should not be provided in the event of voluntary resignation except in special circumstances.
5.2 Severance pay should not exceed 12 months fixed salary in addition to possible pay during the period of notice.
5.3 Should the person concerned be appointed to a new position or receive remuneration from an enterprise in which they are an active owner, severance pay should be reduced by a proportionate amount calculated on the basis of the person's new annual income. Such a reduction should first be made after the normal period of notice has expired.
5.4 Severance pay may be suspended if conditions exist which would have justified dismissal or if, during the severance period, irregularities or acts of negligence are discovered which might lead to compensation claims or to criminal charges against the person concerned.

These ships were sold to Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, respectively, and chartered back for a period of 15 years with an option for an additional 5 years on market terms. For the first 15 years the charter hire payments consist of three components; fixed hire in NOK, fixed hire in USD/EUR and a variable element in USD/EUR. The variable element is linked to variable interest rates, 6-month Euribor and Libor rates.

Hurtigruten ASA will undertake and pay for the operation, insurance and all necessary ongoing maintenance of the vessels. In the charter agreements between the limited partnerships and Hurtigruten ASA, identical requirements (financial covenants) have been stipulated for Hurtigruten ASA for the duration of the agreements, which the company has as a component of its long-term loan agreements linked to vessels. Reference is made to note 10 with regard to these financial covenants.

F-310

In connection with the financial restructuring in February 2009, an addendum to the charter agreement was agreed on with the limited partnerships Kystruten KS and Kirberg Shipping KS, which entailed that the instalment component of the charter hire under the charterparties with the two limited companies will not be payable until 31 December 2011. The postponed instalments will, however, be added to the instalments to be paid in 2012 and 2013, thereby reverting to the original repayment plan in August 2013. For their proportionate shares of the outstanding debt, the limited partnerships will receive any payments that are made under the cash sweep clause for the banks, as described in note 10. An increase in the charter hire was also agreed to compensate for the increased costs incurred by the limited partnerships under their loan agreements because of the changes in the repayment profile. In addition, it has been agreed that Hurtigruten's option to buy back the MS Nordlys and MS Richard With will be cancelled. The annual rent and the instalments that accrue in accordance with the agreement are recognised as an expense in the accounts. No instalment payments have been made under the cash sweep clause in 2011. In the first quarter of 2011 Hurtigruten ASA has made extraordinary instalment payments on the bareboat charter hire. The extraordinary instalment payments have been made through the release of funds that were restricted as security for the charter agreement. These funds have been used in their entirety for an extraordinary repayment of borrowings in the two limited companies.

NOTE 22 EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
Refinancing of Hurtigruten's debt
On 7 March 2012 Hurtigruten ASA signed a loan agreement for NOK 2.6 billion with a bank syndicate consisting of eight Norwegian and foreign banks. Six of these banks also participated in Hurtigruten's former bank syndicate. The loan is to be repaid in annual instalments of NOK 260 million and have a term of five years with a margin of 350 basis points (3.5 per cent).
F-313

An unsecured bond loan totalling NOK 500 million was also issued on the same date. The loan has a term of five years and one month and a margin of 700 basis points (7.0 per cent).
This means that all of Hurtigruten's existing bank debt of approximately NOK 3 billion has been refinanced. This refinancing has been made possible by the operational restructuring that has taken place in recent years, the good development on the passenger side, and the new agreement with the government that takes effect on 1 January 2012 with significantly better terms than the old agreement.
The refinancing provides Hurtigruten with a prudent capital structure for the next five years with a repayment profile adapted to the company's operations and expected earnings.
