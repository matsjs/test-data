To the bondholders in:
ISIN NO 001 056161.6 - Marine Subsea Cyprus Holdings Limited Exchange Bond Series H Bond Issue 2009/2019
Oslo, 15 September 2011
Ad. Interest payment due 16 September 2011 as Payment-in-Kind - suspended Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as Loan Trustee for the above-captioned bond issue (the "Loan") where Marine Subsea Cyprus Holdings is issuer (the "Issuer"). Pursuant to the agreement dated 14 December 2009, the Issuer has the opportunity to make any of the first eight interest payments as Payment-in-Kind (i.e. as additional bonds) if the amount of interest due exceeds Available Cash. The Issuer has confirmed that this is the case and the interest payment due 16 September 2011 will be made as Payment-in-Kind. The outstanding amount under the Loan significantly exceeds what can be expected to be repaid by the Issuer, and as an interest payment, including Payment-in-Kind, may trigger a tax liability for some of the bondholders, the Issuer has proposed to cancel the Payment-in-Kind to avoid such potential tax. NTM has agreed to suspend the Payment-in-Kind, but not to cancel it. The Payment-in-Kind is expected to either be made during 2011 or a proposal to write off the interest due 16 September 2011 may be put forward to a bondholders' meeting. There is also a Payment-in-Kind due 16 September 2011 in the other bond loan issued by the Issuer. This payment is suspended on similar terms as for the Loan.
Best regards Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
