Oslo, 29 April 2013
Notice to Bondholders
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM" or the "Trustee" or the "Loan Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders of bonds (the "Bondholders") in the following loan agreements; loan agreement dated 5 January 2007 with ISIN NO 001 034773.5 described in the loan agreement "FRN Petroprod Ltd Callable Bond Issue 07/12" and loan agreement dated 22 May 2007 with ISIN NO 001 036899.6 described in the loan agreement "10.85% Petroprod Ltd Secured Callable Bond Issue 07/13", (together, the "Bond Agreements") where Petroprod Ltd is the issuer ("Petroprod"), and whereby the Bondholders have made loans available (the "Loans"). All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Bond Agreements, unless otherwise stated. The Loans were declared in default and due for payment on 8 April 2009. On 9 April 2009, the Grand Court of Cayman Islands ordered joint liquidators of Petroprod. As the liquidation process has concluded that there will be no further distributions to the Bondholders, the remaining principal amount is therefore discharged. To stop further cost to accrue, the Bond Trustee has decided that the Bonds shall cease to exist in the Norwegian Security Depository ("VPS"). A copy of the records will be kept for future reference, but subsequent to the termination there is not possible to move holdings in the VPS. Further information to the Bondholders will be available on the web-site www.stamdata.no. Yours sincerely, No^sk Tilbtsmapn ASA
