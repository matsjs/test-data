NOTE 15 - FINANCIAL RISK
The company uses financial instruments to manage its foreign currency and interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk The company has fixed rate so there is no risk related to interest rates.
Currency risk Fluctuations in exchange involves both direct and indirect risks to the company. The company has an active approach to currency risk and it is entered into agreements that reduce this risk. The company's long term debt is in US dollars. It is signed long term contracts for four of its vessels with rate in US dollars. They already signed contracts and paid to the company in that currency has a cash flow that covers the interest on its loans in US dollars. There is therefore no currency risk associated with the payment of interest on long-term debt.
