SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING

Oslo, 6th June 2017

INTRODUCTION Nordic Trustee ASA (formerly Norsk Tillitsmann ASA) (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issue (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issue") issued by Brødrene Greger AS (the "Issuer").
Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement for the Bonds dated 2 April 2013 and entered into between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated herein or therein. References to clauses and paragraphs are references to clauses and paragraphs of the Bond Agreement.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer, the market conditions and the described transactions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.

BACKGROUND
Company update
Reference is made to previous information concerning the Issuer's financial situation. From the time o f the issuance o f the 80 mill. NOK bond loan, the issuers situation has over years been characterized by a continuing satisfactory EBITDA level, but insufficient to cover the high level of financial cost. The outcome has become negative profit margins and a corresponding negative development in the equity relations. By the year end 2016, the company put themselves in contact with the Bond Trustee for the Bondholders, with the intention to find a solution to the financial situation the company was facing.
To be able to continue its operations, the Issuer will be dependent on approval from banks, to get granted a credit facility as well as a guarantee facility. From preliminary conferences with actual banks, the company

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1, Oslo

nordictrustee.com

have got confirmed that equity ratio in the balance account should be strengthened substantially. In addition, the banks demand that the cash balance should be relatively strong.

The banks hold the opinion that before the final processing of our case, containing a credit facility and a guarantee facility, the equity in the balance sheet must be improved. If the Debt to Equity Swap suggested below will be sufficient for the company to be granted the above financial products, is not possible to confirm at this stage. The Issuer considers that it is in the common interest of the Issuer as well as the Bondholders to approve the proposal prior to continue with the discussion with the banks to approve the proposal in order to strengthen the outlook for a viable agreement with the bank. The Issuer can, however, not exclude the possibility that the negotiations regarding the establishment of the credit facility might require amendments to the decisions in the Bondholders Meeting and that additional Bondholders' meetings might be required. Even though the Issuer so far has indications of the contents and claims, it can't be excluded that the conditions and terms might differ from expectations. The assumed terms are therefore not included in this notice.

The company has attached a presentation including the annual accounts of 2016 (Schedule B). The final

approval from the auditor is dependent upon the Bondholder':

However, after a Debt to Equity Swap is agreed upon amongst the Bondholders, the Company will put effort in finding a viable solution with banks. No guarantees for that a viable solution might be reached can be given by the Issuer.

It is paramount for the Issuer to get granted the credit facility and the guarantee frame to implement a production and marketing scheme with a volume sufficient to create positive profit in the years to come.

The Issuer has after the Bond Issuance entered into a loan ofN O K 5.000.000 the 3 1st March 2017. This loan has a non-possessory lien on the Issuer's stock o f good used in the Business. This lien will be removed and deleted provided the Proposal will be approved by the Bondholder's meeting.

The Issuer also have entered an agreement with an Italian company whereby the Issuer has a contract production of stock fish. Due to that there is no approval required for contract production of stock fish such agreement has not required any approval.

The proposal includes a removal of a part of the securities that has been established, the factoring agreement and a lien on the Issuers stock of good. No mortgages in the properties, charges over Machinery and Plant or the share pledges will be removed. These securities will continue as before this Proposal. Furthermore, no removal will be made unless this is required by an acknowledged bank providing financial means.

The Issuer, furthermore, point out that there is no incentives or lock up-agreements that has currently been made with key personal in the Issuer. However, the general manager Goran Rune Greger and the key employee Johnny Tvenning Greger has both given statements that they will not terminate their employment contracts with the Issuer before May 1st 2022 if the Bondholders approve the Proposal. The Issuer concludes that no additional incentive programs at this point in time is required.

No dividends have been paid in cash and no such decisions has been made. However prior to the Bond Issuance a debt by some shareholders were settled through a dividend payment.

The Issuer, however, is aware of the importance o f key persons for the company's survival and viability. Such agreements will be made and the Issuer is also considering the possibility o f replacement programs if

the key persons should not enter into a lockup agreement. The Issuer has considered the negotiation strength to be stronger and better after the decision below, hereunder, the election of a new board of directors has been made.
In this respect, the Issuer want to put forward a proposal for a restructuring o f its capital structure more fully described below (the "Restructuring").
The Issuer will prior to the subscription of shares reduce the nominal value of the share capital from 5.671.000 to 1.134.200 by reducing the nominal value o f each share from NOK 1.000 to NOK 200. A share split that multiplies the existing number o f shares with 100 will also be made prior to the conversion meaning that the nominal value pro share is NOK 2.
Prior to the approval o f the prospectus and the subscription of the shares, the Issuer has kept the share book internally in the Issuer. The company will at the time o f issuance ensure that all shares are registered by the shareholder service in an acknowledged Norwegian bank or in the Norwegian CPS register (Verdipapirsentralen).
The interest will after 1st July 2017 be paid twice a year, 31th July and 31th January. Next first interest payment will therefore be 3 1st July 2017 for the period after 30 April 2017 at the interest rate of 8 per cent. Thereafter the next interest payment date will be 31st January 2018. Provided the approval by the Bondholders o f the Proposal all payments will in the future be paid in cash.

Authorise and instruct the Bond Trustee to take such steps on behalf of the Bondholders as may be necessary or desirable in connection with the implementation o f the Restructuring, including, without limitation, to:
a. prepare, finalise and enter into the necessary amendment agreements and other documentation it in its sole discretion deems appropriate in connection with documenting the decisions made by the Bondholders' Meeting according to this summons;

EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL The Issuer's evaluation of the Proposal If the resolutions set out in this summons are not passed, or if any other condition or implementation o f the Restructuring is not satisfied, the Issuer expects that it will turn out to be impossible to secure a viable financial solution with any relevant bank. In such a case, the Issuer will have no other option than file for bankruptcy. This will in turn be followed by a declaration of default from the Bond Trustee, on behalf of

the Bondholders. The Issuer holds the opinion that this outcome will cause substantial losses for the Bondholders.
NON-RELIANCE
The Proposal is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the Proposal is acceptable and vote accordingly.

GREGER
BRØDRENE GREGER AS Restrukturering av finansiering
April 2017

BAKGRUNN
· Brødrene GregerAS opptok i 2014 et 5 års 10,9 % obligasjonslån på 80 MNOKtil refinansiering av sine daværende kreditter, investeringer og transaksjonskostnader.
· Bakgrunnen var at små og mellomstore virksomheter i Norge opplevde at bankene strammet inn sine vilkår vesentlig pga. strengere kapitalkrav for bankene. Brødrene GregerAS ønsket å refinansiere for å få stabile og langsiktige finansielle forutsetninger som hensyntar selskapet virksomhet og driftsmidler.
· Bedriften erfaringer etter to fulle driftsår er at driften målt ved EBITDA og EBIT forløper tilfredsstillende, men at gjeldsbelastningen og finanskostnadene er for høye til at det er mulig å gjenvinne selskapets tapte egenkapital, og at gruppen ikke vil kunne drive videre med dagens finansiering.
· Manglende likviditet har gjort at Brødrene GregerAS ikke kan utnytte sin produksjonskapasitet og de muligheter som finnes i markedet, og at fokuset blir på begrenset likviditet i stedet for på økt produksjon med klart positiv resultateffekt.

OM SELSKAPET
Brødrene Greger, tredje generasjon siden 1920 Startet med tilvirkning av tørrfisk, saltfisk, pakking av rogn og litt eksport av ferskfisk. En periode også kolonialhandel, samt salg av lysolje, fetolje og div. motoroljer. Kolonialhandelen avsluttet i 1970.
Kontinuerlig fornyelse og utvikling Store ombygginger på 1990-tallet, med riving av gammelt anlegg. Nylig erstattet med moderne EU-godkjente lokaler Moderne veie- og sorteringsanlegg for saltfisk og ferskfisk Saltfisklinje med to flekkemaskiner, vakumsug og saltspredeanlegg Fra 2007 faset man ut produksjon av saltfisk for å satse mer på fersk og tørrfiskmarkedet Kjøp av Ekrem Fiskeindustri AS i 2008

Viktigste virksomhetsområde mottak av villfanget fisk. Mottar alle typer hvitfisk hele året Tørrfisk har alltid vært det viktigste produktet Eksport startet i 1991  Eksporteres til hele Europa, med Italia som viktigste marked Annen hvitfisk går til fersk anvendelse nasjonalt og til Europa  På høsten kjøpes det en god del breiflabb som i all hovedsak sendes til Spania.  Lutefisk og utvannet tørrfisk er også en del av produktene vi produserer som hovedsaklig går til det norske markedet
Sterkt fokus på våre leverandører. Investert i rorbuer, hus og båter som benyttes av både fiskere og turister. Drivstoff til båter leveres fra tre leveringspunkter på kai Is og vann leveres på kai.
I 2016 hadde konsernet 33 ansatte og 22 årsverk

LOKALISERING
· Hvilke rolle spiller lokalisering?
Røst er de ytterste øyene i Lofoten, kjent for sine rene hav og spektakulære og rene natur.
Plasseringen av denne øygruppen nord for Polarsirkelen, ligger 30 minutters flytur vest for Bodø og ut i det åpne havet.
I disse rene og næringsrike farvannene bidrar Golfstrømmen og undervannstopografien til optimale forhold for fiskens gyting, med riktig temperatur, strøm og saltholdighet.
Dette skaper forutsetningen for det årlige Lofotfisket fra februar til april. Dette fisket har i århundrer spilt en sentral rolle for Norge, landets befolkning og næringsliv langs kysten.
Røst har den aller mest strategiske lokalisering for produksjon av tørrfisk med et tørt og mildt vinterklima og med vind og lave temperaturer på våren.

Lofotfisket drives hovedsaklig av kystbåter opp til 90 fot. De fisker med line, snøre fluksa), snurrevad og garn.
Fisk som er fisket med line og snøre holder spesielt høy kvalitet. Kvaliteten ivaretas ytterligere ved at fisken kan landes svært nær fiskeplassene. Dette gjør at særlig line og snørefanget fisk svært ettertraktet i markedet og spiller en viktig rolle for fortjeneste og lønnsomhet.

MARKED
I Norge har de fleste en sterk tilknytning til miljø. Selskapet er levende opptatt av å bevare det kalde, klare og rene havet som alltid har gitt mye tilbake.
Norge er en global leder av bærekraftig fiskeriforvaltning.
· Norge kombinerer effektiv forvaltning av sine naturressurser på en måte som fører til kommersiell suksess, som igjen støtter de tusenvis av mennesker som arbeider i Norge nest største industri.
Rapporten tilskriver suksessen til den norske modellen er at en forener miljøhensyn med økonomisk overskudd, slik at disse to elementer av bærekraft går hånd i hånd og gjensidig forsterker hverandre.

Fiskeridirektoratet har bekreftet at den totale 2017 kvoten for norsk arktisk torsk er 890 000 tonn. Norges andel av totalkvoten er på 400 000 tonn, Også for andre arter er det meget høye kvoter for 2017.

Etterspørselen etter sjømat har vært økenede i løpet av de siste årene.

Markedssituasjonen for de produkter som Brødrene

GregerAS produserer er lovende også ved inngangen ·;

til 2017.

\

Etterspørselen etter fersk torsk forventes å være høy også inn i 2017, både i det norske markedet og i EU området.

Konsumet og etterspørselen etter tørrfisk har vært stabilt over de siste årene, og forventes å være på samme nivå også i 2017.

BESKYTTET GEOGRAFISK BETEGNELSE
Tørrfisk fra Lofoten har opp nådd å få sin egen akkred itering som Beskyttet G eografisk Betegnelse, noe som er viktig i den langsiktige byggingen av m erkevaren. Dette vil ha betydning i alle markeder, også det viktige italienske m arkedet fo r tørrfisk.

EXITMULIGHETER FOR AKSJONÆ RER
Styret vil løpende arbeide for at alle aksjonærer skal finne muligheter for lønnsom avhending av sine aksjer. Vi regner tre scenarierfor de mest sannsynlige:
· Utbytte
- fra 2020: Etter at obligasjonslån er innfridd vil styret ha om ambisjon å betale et utbytte på 10% pa.
· Tilbakekjøp av egne aksjer
- Styret vil ha som ambisjon å kjøpe tilbake alle aksjer som stammer fra konvertering av obligasjonslån over 5 år fra 2020.
· Salg av selskapet
- Styret vil etter 2020 også vurdere et industrielt salg av selskapet. Basert på de prognoser som er gjengitt vurderer styret at prisingen av aksjekapitalen i selskapet vil ligge mellom NOK 60 mill. og NOK 80 mill.
