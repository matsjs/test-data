The Transaction constitutes a Mandatory Prepayment Event that would require and entitle SKDP 1 Ltd. to conduct a mandatory redemption o f the Outstanding Bonds in accordance with clause 10.4.1 o f the Bond Agreement with Norsk Tillitsmann ASA upon completion o f the Transaction. The tribunal also found that Norsk Tillitsmann ASA shall pay the costs of the arbitration tribunal and SKDP 1 Ltd. The arbitration award may be published in full on Stamdata later.
