III THE BANKRUPTCY

1.

Declaration of bankruptcy:

Bankruptcy was filed for at Aust-Agder tingrett in a judgement on 24 April 2015, at 11:00 am.

2.

Basis for bankruptcy

The company announced the opening of bankruptcy negotiations (court-supervised settlement) on 12 December 2014. This was approved on 15 December 2014. The Lawyer, Jon Skjorshammer was appointed as leader of the debt tribunal.

At a meeting on 22 April 2015, it was decided to terminate the debt negotiations. The administrators found that following an examination of the company debt situation and the framework laid down in Section 30 of the Bankruptcy Act, it would not be possible to present a proposal for a court-supervised settlement that was implementable in practice.

INFORMATION ON BANKRUPT COMPANY

The company is part of a group of companies (concern). The group structure is as follows:

Cecon ASA

Cecon Contracting AS (49,9%)

Cecon BAM N L)1' ( 100% )

Rever Offshore A S 2) (81,7%)
Cecon Shipping 1 AS

Cecon Shipping 2 AS

Cecon Shipping 3 AS

1) Cecon B.V. went under administration for bankruptcy in H olland on 02 December 2014. 2) A ll shares in Revet Offshore AS are pledged to M ordic (siaNordic Trustee] ASA.

VI THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE BANKRUPT COMPANY

l.

Situation at the point of insolvency

Taking the situation of the estate into consideration, (economy, creditors, question of liability, dividend etc.) the estate administration does not consider a deeper analysis of the position at the point of insolvency.

A qualitative assessment of the assets and liquidity will pose considerable problems in terms of resources and costs and will be further complicated by the fact that the company was part of a larger group undergoing reconstruction.

The report of 21 May 2014 presents key figures for the three years prior to the bankruptcy that show that the company was technically financially healthy (from the point of view of balance) and had positive capital. However, it is the administrators' opinion that the company's valueadjusted balance was negative, as the accountable value of neither shares in subsidiary companies nor claims against these could be justified due to the negative development in the subsidiary companies.

The company's liquidity situation is among other factors characterised by neglect of bonded debt during the autumn of 2014, and the administrators believe it is likely that the company was already illiquid at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014.

Var ref.: 3379007.1-136975 FJELIN/FJELIN

5TEEN5TRUP STORDRANGE

5 o f 12

The administrators therefore have reason to assume that the company was insolvent at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014.
With regard to the future operation the company; from that point up to the bankruptcy, the board and management believed there was a basis for working on a solution for reconstruction, while at the same time, most of the company's creditors were aware that the business was in financial difficulties.

2.

Other economic circumstances

See point VI of the report on the first creditor's meeting on 22 May 2015 for further information on the Company's financial position.

VII POSITION AND STATUS OF THE ESTATE

1.

Assets:

The estate account currently holds NOK 3,506,676.77.

These funds are divided between the following assets and settlements:
1.2. Bank accounts The closure of the company accounts transferred NOK 3,091 to the administration.
When bankruptcy was declared, the Company had NOK 275,000 deposited in an operational account. Payments were made from this account to Tandberg Holding AS. The amount was released for the benefit of the payee as the demand exceeded the amount in the account.

When bankruptcy was declared, the Company had NOK 463,716 deposited in a tax account. Due to tax owing, the amount has been paid to the tax authorities, cf. Section 5-12 of the Tax Payment Act.
1.2. Repaymentsfollowing termination of insurance agreements. The Company's insurance agreements have been terminated and the administration has received repayments of NOK 33,325.

The Company's liability insurance was extended after the beneficiaries covered the insurance.

2.3. Shares When bankruptcy was declared, the Company owned shares in the following companies:

Cecon Contracting AS 49.9%

Reellay AS

50%

Cecon NL B.V.

100%

Varref.: 3379007.1-136975 FJELIN/FJELIN

STEEN5TRUP STORDRANGE

6 o f 12

(this company is undergoing bankruptcy)
Rever Offshore AS 81.7%
(The shares are pledged to Nordic Trustee)
With regard to the sale of shares in Cecon Contracting AS, Reellay AS and Rever Offshore AS, please see subsection 2 below.
Shares in Cecon NL B.V. were of no value as the company was undergoing bankruptcy in Holland.
The Company also owned shares in the Canadian company Davie Yards Inc., which underwent a comprehensive restructuring process prior to the bankruptcy of Cecon ASA. Pierre Laporte, of Deloitte, Canada and leader of the restructuring process has confirmed that Davie Yards is a company without activities and assets. On the basis of this, the administrators decided to abandon the shares, cf. Section 117 b of the Bankruptcy Act.
1.4. Physical assets The Company's physical assets comprise various items of office equipment to an estimated value of NOK 75,000. The physical assets are pledged to Nordic Trustee. As the pledge demand exceeded the value of the items, the administration decided to abandon the equipment, cf. Section 117 b of the Bankruptcy Act
1.5. Claims against group companies On 31 December 2014, the Company recorded claims of NOK 14.8 million against Cecon B.V. The claims were secured with pledges of EUR 8 million in claims Cecon B.V had against Gas de France. The pledge also secured a guarantee of USD 5 million, which the Company had pledged to Cecon B.V.
At the time bankruptcy was declared, a claim of NOK 32.6 million was entered for Cecon Contracting AS, associated with the sale of company physical assets to Cecon Contracting. The sale was part of the restructuring of the group of companies where Cecon Contracting was to assume the operative business and where the remuneration was to be converted into shares in Cecon Contracting. The conversion was never carried out - see the account in the temporary report of 22 May 2015, point VI (1.2).
The real value of the above claims is assessed as being considerably lower than the amount entered in the accounts. Irrespective of this, the claims are without value to the estate which has transferred them and other assets to Rever Offshore AS - see subsection 2 below.
j.6. Claims on the employees At the time of declaring bankruptcy, the Company had a number of smaller claims against employees totalling NOK 85,000. The claims are used to offset wage demands which are registered as general claims on the estate, cf. Section 9-2 of the Recovery Act.

i .7. Deposit account At the time of declaring bankruptcy, the Company had NOK 175,000 in a deposit account with Nordic Trustee ASA, which had a number of overdue claims against the bankrupt debtor. The administrator has accepted that the amount in the deposit account is offset by Nordic Trustee ASA.
i.S. Final amount from sale of assets and loss guarantees accrued during the debt negotiation period The estate has received USD 500,000 in connection with sale of assets in Rever Offshore AS. In addition, the estate received USD 150,000 from Rever Offshore AS to cover losses accrued during the debt negotiation period. See subsection 2 below.
1.9. Other outstanding debt The estate has received a VAT refund of NOK 107,065. Based on the registration of Rever Offshore AS in the VAT registry, the estate has transferred NOK 61,818 to Rever Offshore AS as the company's share of the refund.
The estate has received NOK 14,862 in reimbursement from NAV Arendal. The payment is based on debts owed by the company when bankruptcy was declared.
2. Realisation of assets The Company's assets in Rever Offshore AS (81.7%) have been transferred to York Capital Management. The shares were pledged to Nordic Trustee ASA who agreed to the transfer. The transfer included the company's immaterial rights. At the same time, most of the company's assets were transferred to Rever. The transfer comprised in part pledged assets and in part free assets.
The transfer included the company's assets (49.9%) in Cecon Contracting AS, the company's claim against Cecon Contracting AS, and its claim against Cecon NL B.V. The transfer also included the company's claim against Gaz De France which the company had had transferred from Cecon NL B.V,
In connection with the previous debt negotiations, Rever has agreed to cover the company's loss during the debt negotiation period.
Altogether, the estate has received USD 650,000 from Rever Offshore AS as a final and complete payment for the above assets and to cover the losses accrued during the debt negotiations.
The company's assets in Reellay AS (50%) were sold to Eiendoms og Prosjekteringsselskabet AS [property and project management company] for NOK 15,000 The estate has assessed the assets as having no significant value.

3.

Voidable and compensatory transactions

In collaboration with the administration accountant, the estate has examined the company accounts and available documents to assess any voidable and/or compensatory transactions.

The examination has revealed that Cecon ASA's operational costs in 2014 were actually covered by an ongoing reduction of the company claims against Rever Offshore AS. Under the agreement, Rever Offshore AS would transfer money to Cecon Contracting AS, which was used to pay Cecon ASA's debts. The transfers from Rever Offshore AS to Cecon Contracting AS appeared in Cecon ASA's books as debts to Cecon Contracting AS on one side and a reduction of Cecon ASA's claim against Rever Offshore AS on the other. The money Cecon Contracting AS received from Rever Offshore AS was, as mentioned, used to pay Cecon ASA's operational costs, so Cecon ASA's external debt was honoured and the outstanding amount to Cecon Contracting AS remained unchanged.

After the assessment, the estate added Ernst & Young AS, Ousdal AS and EMAS AMC Pte. Ltd, as the amounts to these were seen as being voidable in accordance with the rules in the Recovery Act. The payments were made as described above with the exception of that to EMAS AMC Pte. Ltd., where the last part of the payment from the Cecon group was Cecon NL B.V. instead of Cecon Contracting AS.

The stated claims were contested and a dialogue has begun regarding them. In connection with this, a postponement in accordance with Section 5-15 of the Recovery Act was agreed.

The estate thereafter entered into an agreement with Ernst & Young AS and Ousdal AS on settlement of the claim. It was not possible for the estate to reach an agreement with EMAS AMC Pte. Ltd. There was also considerable actual and legal uncertainty regarding this case, as well as significant procedural and practical challenges in connection with the question of voidability. The estate has received a total of NOK 350,000 in connection with presentation of the voidability claim.

4.

Liabilities:

The estate has received of 49 claims against the estate totalling NOK 2,578,002,716.56. The

claims have been notified in the following priority:

683,979.00

Disputes/litigation

The company was not involved in any litigation at the time of bankruptcy.

6.

Company activity while under administration

It has not been possible for the company to operate while under administration.

VIII CREDITORS' POSITION

1.

Possibility of repayment

Priority of first class and other unsecured claims have been assessed and approved at NOK 683,979 and NOK 2,564,597,061.71. The remaining part of the unprioritised claims (36 claims for a total of NOK 12,702,240.85) has not been assessed as a normal distribution would not achieve coverage exceeding lR (NOK 860), and these claims were therefore not taken into consideration, cf. Section 128 para. 3 of the Bankruptcy Act. Claims of lesser priority were not

approved by the administrator as they would not achieve coverage, cf. Section 110 (3) of the Bankruptcy Act.

Assuming that the proposals for the final balance are approved, Priority class I claims will all be covered, while unsecured claims will achieve a dividend of around 0.0300%.

The administration notes that the above may change as the court must approve payments and conclude the estate before any amounts can be paid out, cf. Section 122 (3), cf. Section 128 (1) of the Bankruptcy Act.

2.

Testing of claims

Claims have been tested in compliance with Chapter XII of the Bankruptcy Act. All claimants who submitted claims as being liable to compensation were notified in writing at least eight days before the claims were tested by the administrator, cf. Section 111 of the Bankruptcy Act.

IX PUNISHABLE OFFENCES

The administrators have not found any punishable offences

X

GROUND FOR QUARANTINE

No grounds were found to subject the Company's management to bankruptcy quarantine during the procedure.
XI ADMINISTRATION PROCEDURE

The administration procedure has been comprehensive and long drawn out. This has been due to the group structure and the reconstruction that was being carried out at the time of debt negotiation, and later the bankruptcy took place. In addition, much of the administration took place in the administrator's office in Oslo and not from the company headquarters in Arendal, which was due to the illness and absence of the CEO and CFO. There were therefore a number of gaps in the process that the administration was obliged to take into account and investigate in the various assessments.

The company business was international with a subsidiary in Holland. The company also had important contracts and relations with Gaz De France and Davie Yards Ltd. The company's

Var ref.: 3379007.1-136975 FJELIN/FJELIN

5TEENSTRUP 5T0RDRANGE

financial situation was also complicated, with significant bonds via Nordic Trustee that also required amendment. Overall, the situation has brought up many complex issues that were prioritised according to those that, within a reasonable economic framework, would be most likely to result in being able to pay creditors.
The most concrete tasks were as follows:
Once bankruptcy was declared, inspection and registration of assets were carried out as well as meetings with the Company's management, where the more practical considerations regarding the running of the Company, its assets, debts, organisation etc. were investigated. During the liquidation process, the administrators were also in contact with the company's former management with regard to various other questions.
The administrator has undertaken the usual immediate actions with regard to the liquidation, including contacting the known creditors, public registries etc. to reveal all assets, liabilities and any other relevant information on the Company.
A significant part of this work involved examining the Company's accounts, including internal balances and demands, payments of internal and other related issues in connection with the restructuring of the business, and various financial questions directly or indirectly related to other issues, including: Davie Yards Ltd., transactions between group companies and related businesses, the grounds for and durability of the case against Gaz De France which was transferred from Cecon NL B.V.
Assets were realised as examined and noted above.
The administrators have notified non-entry into the leasing agreement associated with the Company's premises in Arendal, cf. Section 7-10 of the Recovery Act.
The administrators have terminated the Company's insurance and extended the Board members' liability insurance.
The company accounts, bank accounts etc. have been investigated and assessed to discover whether any voidable transactions were undertaken in the period leading up to the bankruptcy. Invalidity requests have been sent to Ernst & Young AS, Ousdal AS and EMAS AMC Pte. Ltd.
The administrators have undertaken all the necessary investigations into uncovering possible criminal circumstances and/or transactions that might attract compensation without any result.
A meeting was held with the employees at the Company's premises in Arendal. The administrators dealt with seven wage guarantee claims from former employees and have paid out NOK 463,003. In addition, the administrator has settled two wage claims outside the guarantee scheme as the estate had funds to prioritise Class 1 creditors.

Accumulated costs classed as common claims on the bankruptcy estate accumulated during the bankruptcy negotiation period have been calculated in accordance with Section 9-2 of the Recovery Act.
Prior to the bankruptcy negotiations, withdrawals were made to the benefit of one creditor on a number of the company's assets, including a vehicle and bank accounts. The reason for the demand and the payments was unclear for some time and required considerable effort on the part of the administrator to uncover the circumstances surrounding the demand. The funds were released and the vehicle realised in collaboration with the recipient.
The Company's operational equipment and shares in Davie Yards Inc. were abandoned.
The administrators have calculated and received compensation for VAT.
The agreements with Nordic Trustee have been examined.
The administrators have dealt with a great many requests from the Company's creditors and other associated parties.
The administrator has participated in the first hearing and prepared an interim report including current position, annual financial summary, final report and final balance. The report has been translated into English.

XII CONCLUSION OF BANKRUPTCY
The administrator is not aware of any other assets that could serve as payment for creditors. The administrator therefore proposes that the estate is wound up.
It is proposed that the administrator's fee is NOK 1,240,800 excl. VAT (NOK 1,551,000 incl. VAT)
It is proposed that the administration accountant's fee is NOK 690,000 excl. VAT. (NOK 862,500 incl. VAT), of which NOK 150,000 relates to work carried out during the debt negotiation period and NOK 540,000 for work carried out during the bankruptcy negotiations.
The fee for members of the creditor's committee is NOK 1,500 per member.

conducted, comments should be submitted to Aust-Agder district court within 14 days of the date of the report.
