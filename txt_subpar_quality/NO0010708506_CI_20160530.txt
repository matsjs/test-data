Q1 2016 Update from the board of directors

Financial performance Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its subsidiaries, hereafter "the Group" experienced a challenging quarter in Q1 2016. Markets wherein the Group operates are tough and competition is increasing. The Group however managed to maintain volumes and focused on cost saving projects. This resulted in a decreased EBITDA in comparison to prior year.
The Q1 sales of the group showed a decrease of 3.4% vs Q1 2015 The decrease in revenues is caused by increased price pressure as a result of market competition. However the total testing volumes and surveys show a positive movement and have increased in Q1 in comparison to prior year.

The Group closed Q1 2016 financials with a net profit of USD 588 thousand (Q1 2015: net profit of USD 238 thousand) which is mainly driven by the decrease in other operating expenses and reduced bond loan interest expenses due to the bond buy-backs.
The exceptional items include the one off impact of the cost reduction program (i.e. the reallocation of the shared service center). The capital expenditures remained stable.
Organizational changes No changes have occurred within the board of director's of the Group up and till the date of this quarterly report.

Costs (adjusted for one-off / non-recurring items) of the Group in Q1 2016 were lower than Q1 2015 reflecting amongst others the cost reduction programs. The Group's Q1 2016 EBITDA decreased to USD 3,416 thousand (2015: USD 3,778 thousand).

Explanatory notes to condensed consolidated interim financial statements

1. Reporting entity
Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. is a company domiciled in The Netherlands. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as at and for the three months ended 31 March 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The Group primarily provides testing and survey services to the Maritime industry.
2. Basis of accounting
This condensed consolidated interim financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim financial reporting. It does not include all the information required for a complete set of IFRS financials statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant for an understanding of the changes in the Group's financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2015.
This condensed consolidated interim financial statement was authorised for issue by the Company's Board of Management on 30 May 2016.

3. Use of judgments and estimates
In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant judgements made by management in applying the group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2015.
4. Restatement of 2015 quarterly reports
The results presented for the period ending 31 March 2015 are different from what was published last year. The 2015 quarterly results were prepared with the best knowledge available at that time but in the course of 2015 better insight has developed as a result of amongst others compliance with IFRS reporting and annual closing 2015. The 2015 quarterly results have been changed accordingly for comparison purposes. An overview of the differences is presented below.

9. Net finance costs
The change in net finance costs is mainly caused by the borrowing structure of the Group, partly offset by an increase of currency exchange results, amortised costs for the bond loan and gains resulted from the bond buy-back. Starting 2016 the interest income bond buy-back concerns the income in interest as result of the bond buy back in 2015 and Q1 2016. The net finance costs of the Group is as follows.

There have been no subsequent events between the period ending 31 March 2016 and the release for publication of these consolidated interim financial statements on 30 May 2016.
