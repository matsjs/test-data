To the bondholders of:

ISIN NO 001 065040.1 - 20.00 per cent EOAL Cyprus Holdings Limited Super Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2012/2013

ISIN NO 001 065551.7 - 20.00 per cent EOAL Cyprus Holdings Limited Super Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2012/2013

Oslo, 16 O ctober 2012

REVERSE PAYMENT-IN-KIND

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NT") acts as loan trustee for the bond issue consisting of two tranches with ISIN NO 001065040.1 and ISIN NO 001065551.7 (the "Bond Issue") where EOAL Cyprus Holdings Limited is the issuer (the "Issuer"). The terms and conditions for the Bond Issue are set out in a bond agreement entered into by NT and the Issuer 20 June 2012 (the "Bond Agreement").

On 24 September 2012 a payment-in-kind ("PIK "), by way of issuing additional bonds, was made in the Bond Issue. The Bond Agreement specifies that interest should only be compounded quarterly, and no PIK should be made.

In order to re-set the situation the bonds issued in the PIK 24 September will be redeemed at price 0. This will be carried out as pro rata redemption, equal to the number of bonds issued as PIK on 24 September 2012.

Record Date: Price: % of principal to be redeemed: Redemption Date:

ISIN NO001065040.1: EoB 16 October 2012 0
4.76190 19 October

N0001065551.7: EoB 16 October 2012 0
2.28008 19 October

Most bonds in the Bond Issue are held in Euroclear. As far as NT is informed, ISINN0001065040.1 held in Euroclear has not been credited PIK bonds, and will consequently not see any bonds removed from their accounts either. However, ISIN NO001065551.7 held in Euroclear, and bonds in both ISIN held directly in VPS, did receive PIK bonds, and will see a corresponding reduction.

Due to this extraordinary redemption, one should be particularly careful in second hand trading prior to the redemption on 19 October 2012.

Yours sincerely, Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
