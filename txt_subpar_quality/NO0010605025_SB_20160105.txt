Havila Shipping ASA Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2011/2017

Oslo, 5 January 2016
Su m m o n s to B o n d h o ld e rs' Meeting
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond issues (the "Bonds" or the "Bond Issues") issued by Havila Shipping ASA as issuer (the "Company" or the "Issuer").
Capitalised terns used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 28 March 2011 (the "Bond Agreement"), unless otherwise stated.
The information in this summons regarding the Issuer, the market conditions and the described transactions is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1 BACKGROUND
The downturn in the offshore market has, as for other major players in the sector, had a significant impact on the Company. The market for offshore vessels is characterized by supply far exceeding demand. As a consequence of low fleet utilization and rates achieved, many vessels in this segment have generated revenues below operating expenses. Further, vessel valuations are expected in general to extend its decline. The Company has taken measures to adapt to the prevailing market conditions, including as previously reported by lay up of vessels and other cost reducing efforts which will have full effect in the financial statements from Q1 2016 and onwards.
The Company foresees severe financial challenges for the period 2016-2018, and has several debt maturities coming up over the next months, of which it has no readily available means of refinancing. Fuither, cash flow from operations is not sufficient to serve the current amortisation schedules, and the Company does not expect that the market will improve materially in the short to medium term. On this basis the Company has worked towards a refinancing solution (the "Refinancing") which will allow the Company to maintain a sufficient liquidity buffer to operate through 2018 despite the current downturn.
As announced on 5 January 2016, the Company has over the last months been in discussions with its secured and unsecured bank lenders and has entered into a restructuring agreement (the "Master Agreement") setting out the main terms and conditions of the Refinancing, consisting of the following main elements:
(i) Reduced amortisation for 2016, 2017 and 2018
· The sum of NOK 107,075,573 and USD 5,067,819 in aggregate annual amortization on secured debt, distributed based on a pro-rata downward adjustment of the current amortisation schedule.

PO Box 1470 Vika, N-0116 Oslo, Haakon Vlls gate 1. Oslo

nordictrustee.com

Certain adjustments are made to the general principle for two highly leveraged vessels on long term charters. · Free liquidity in excess of NOK 400 million swept in 2017 and 2018 and applied on a pro-rata basis according to the cumulative deferred instalments of secured debt. · Secured lenders (including bondholders) to be entitled to a "back-end fee" of 1% of amount of deferred instalments, to be paid on 30 June 2020.
(ii) Amended maturities
· All secured debt with final maturity date and balloon payment prior to 30 June 2020 to mature on 30 June 2020.
· All secured debt with no balloon payment extended to reflect postponed amortization. · All unsecured debt to mature 31 December 2020.
(iii) Unsecured debt - interest expenses and payment in kind
· The credit margin on unsecured debt shall be set to 550 bps. · Interest payments falling in the period 2016-2018 shall be paid in kind through increase of
principal amount (bank debt) or issuance of additional bonds (bond issue), annually in arrears. · Interest payments for the period 2019-2020 to be paid in cash if a cash flow budget demonstrates
sufficient cash flow to cover interest and instalments on secured debt, otheiwise in kind.
(iv) Amended financial covenants
· 100% fair market value covenant for each secured facility from 1 January 2017 (one year cure period).
· Minimum cash covenant of NOK 150 million. · Positive working capital covenant (current interest bearing debt to be excluded from calculation). · Above covenants to replace existing financial covenants.
(v) New equity
· NOK 200 million in new equity. · The Saevik family intends to maintain its current proportionate shareholding and Havila Holding
AS has guaranteed a subscription of NOK 102 million, subject to completion of the Refinancing.
The main principle of the Refinancing is for each creditor group to be treated equally and to contribute based on its contractual seniority, regardless of whether such creditor group consists of banks or bondholders. The minimum NOK 200 million equity issue will imply a significant contribution also from shareholders taking into account the current market capitalisation.
The Master Agreement is effective as of 31 December 2015 and subject to the following main conditions to be subsequently satisfied:
· Approval by bondholders of corresponding amendments to the Company's bond agreements as set forth herein no later than 31 January 2016,
® New equity in the minimum amount of NOK 200 million no later than 15 March 2016, and · Acceptable renegotiation of payment of the bareboat charter hire for "Havila Troll" no later than
31 January 2016.
If and when implemented, the Refinancing will reduce interest payments and amortisations to a more manageable level considering the prevailing circumstances. The Refinancing is intended to be sufficiently robust to sustain also a low case scenario with a minimal risk to covenants through 2018, and more manageable risk of covenant breach thereafter. Postponement of maturities until 30 June 2020 ensures sufficient time for the Company to refinance in an expected recovering market. While the Company is pleased to have reached agreement with its bank lenders and present an outline for the
2

Refinancing, it is also clear that the conditions set out herein reflect the extremely challenging conditions now facing the Company and all its stakeholders.
Further reference is made to the Issuer's stock exchange announcement of 5 January 2016, and the summons letters dated today for bondholders meetings in the Issuer's two other bond loans, HAVI04 and HAVI08. In addition, a presentation providing further details on the Refinancing and other relevant information and updates is attached to this summons as Appendix B.
2 THE PROPOSAL
Based on the above, the Issuer has approached the Bond Trustee in accordance with Clause 16.2.1 of the Bond Agreement and requested that a Bondholders' Meeting be held to consider the amendments.
The Issuer proposes that the Bondholders' Meeting resolve to approve the Refinancing and the following amendments (and any implicit amendments relating thereto) to the Bond Agreement (the "Proposal"):
2,1 Maturity and Call Option
In Clause 1.1 (Definitions), the definition of "Maturity Date" shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced by the following:
""Maturity Date" means 30 June 2020 or an earlier maturity date as provided fo r in this Bond Agreement. Anyfurther adjustment may be made according to the Business Day Convention. "
In Clause 1.1 (Definitions), the following definitions shall be added:
""Aggregated Deferred Instalments" means the aggregated cumulative difference, at the end o f each quarter, between the original instalment schedule in effect as o f [relevant date to be included], and the Adjusted Instahnents fo r each Secured Facility (each a "Deferred Instalment"). "
"Repair Amount" means the amount o f any shortfall resultingfrom non-compliance with Clause 13.5.1 (a) (Market Value o f Vessel).
"Secured Facilities" means (i) the secured bank facilities as at the date hereoffor which any Group Company is a borrower, (ii) the Bond Issue and (Hi) the FRN Havila Shipping ASA Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2010/2016 (ISIN N00010590441), collectively (each a "SecuredFacility").""
In Clause 10.1 (Maturity), Clause 10.1.1 shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced by the following:
"The Bonds constituting FRN Tranche shall be repaid asfollows:
(a) with instalments o f f ) NOK 852,843 on each Interest Payment Date from and including the Interest Payment Date in March 2016 to and including the Interest Payment Date in December 2018 (the "AdjustedInstalments"); and (ii) NOK 3,750,000 on each Interest Payment Date thereafter; and
(b) with a balloon equal to the remaining Outstanding Bonds on the Maturity Date."
Furthermore, in Clause 10.1 (Maturity), Clause 10.1.3 shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced by the following:
"The Bonds constituting Fixed Tranche shall be repaid asfollows:
(a) with instalments o f (i) subject to any reduction as setforth below, NOK 852,843on each
3

Interest Payment Date from and including the Interest Payment Date in March 2016 to and including the Interest Payment Date in December 2018 (the "Adjusted Instalments "); and (ii) NOK 3,750,000 on each Interest Payment Date thereafter; and
(b) with a balloon equal to the remaining Outstanding Bonds on the Maturity Date."
In Clause 10.2 (Call Option), Clause 10.2.1 shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced by the following:
"The Issuer may at any time redeem the Bonds (in whole and in part) at a price equal to 100% o f par value plus accrued interests on the redeemed amount.
In Clause 10.4 (Mandatory Redemption), Clauses 10.4.1 and 10.4.2 shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced by the following:
"Upon a Mandatory Redemption Event (other than a Total Loss Event) occurring the Issuer shall, on or about the day the Issuer is receiving the proceeds following the relevant Mandatory Redemption Event, redeem 100 % o f the Outstanding Bonds at a price equal to 100% o f par value (plus accrued interest on the redeemed amount), always provided, however, that such redemption amount shall not exceed the netproceedsfrom the Mandatory Redemption Event.
Upon a Total Loss Event occurring, the Lssuer shall redeem 100% o f the Outstanding Bonds at 100% o f par value (plus accrued interest on redeemed amount) on the earlier o f (i) the date falling one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Total Loss Event, and (ii) the date the insurance proceeds are available to the Lssuer, always provided, however, that such redemption amount shall not exceed the netproceedsfrom the insurance proceeds.
Partial redemption shall be carried out pro rata between the Bonds (according to the procedures o f the Security Register), and shall be made at par value (100%) plus accrued interest. "
2.2 Interest
Clause 9.1 (Interest Fixed Tranche) shall be amended to reflect that the Fixed Rate shall apply up to and including 30 March 2017 (being the original Maturity Date), and that the Fixed Tranche thereafter shall have the same floating interest payment as the Floating Tranche. It is therefore proposed that Clause 9.1.1 shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced by the following:
"The Lssuer shall pay interest on the Fixed Tranche from and including the Lssue Date to 30 March 2017 (being the original Maturity Date) at afixed rate o f eight point six per cent (8.60%) per annum (the "Fixed Rate") and thereafter pay a floating rate equal to the Floating Rate (and Clauses 9.2.2 through 9.2.5 applying mutatis mutandis and replacing Clauses 9.1.2 through 9.1.5)."

I f and to the extent there is a further decrease in the Market Value o f the Vessel during said remedy period, the same procedure shall applyfo r suchfurther or additional shortfall.

 Deferred amount added to balloon payment where applicable  Deferred amount added to tenor for facilities w ith no balloon payment (GIEK facilities)  Unsecured debt to mature 31 December 2020

Amended covenants

 The following covenants to replace existing financial maintenance covenants:

 Min cash covenant: NOK 150m

 Positive working capital covenant (current interest bearing debt to be excluded)

 100% FMW covenant on vessel facility level from 1/1/2017 w ith one year repair period (secured debt only)

 No dividends and other undertakings

6

Rationale behind proposal
1. Maintain a sufficient liquidity buffer for Havila Shipping to operate through 2018  Postpone all final debt maturities until 2020  Reduce amortisations to a reasonably acceptable level considering the prevailing circumstances  No cash leakage through investments or dividends  Sufficiently robust to sustain also in a operational low case scenario
2. Significant contributions from all stakeholders required  Banks and bondholders contribute on equal basis w ith reduced amortization and postponed maturities  Unsecured creditors in addition to contribute w ith PIK coupon  NOK 200m in new equity - substantial investment for all shareholders in light of current market cap
3. Sufficient maturity extensions and covenant headroom to attract new equity  Main principle: No final maturities through 2018  Critical for shareholder support that there is no debt m aturity wall immediately after the 3 year extension period  Postponement until 30 June 2020 ensures sufficient time to refinance in a recovering market  M inor covenant risk through 2018, manageable covenant risk thereafter
4. Moderate refinancing risk by ensuring a viable leverage on all vessels at end 2018  Adjustment to certain facilities backed by long term profitable charters to ensure that all vessels have an estimated FMV in excess of outstanding secured debt at end 2018  Recent refinancings have funded scheduled amortization 7

Timeline
Bank process  Final approval from banks in place and master agreement signed  Effective from 31 December 2015 with bondholder consent within 31 January and completion
of equity issue within 15 March 2016 as a conditions subsequent
Bond process  Summons to bondholder meeting: 5 January 2016  Bondholder meeting and effectuation date: 20 January 2016  Conditions subsequent lifted: 15 March 2016
Equity process  In connection w ith the registration of the share capital increase, the Company will need to
make a share capital reduction involving a 6 weeks creditor notification period.  Indicative timeline:
 Notice of EGM: 5 January 2016  EGM: 26 January 2016. EGM to resolve both share capital reduction and share capital
increase  EGM resolution to be followed by 6 weeks creditor notification period  Registration of new share capital: 15 March 2016 at the latest

Comments
 Strong backlog of NOK 2.8bn from firm contracts1 - strong near term coverage
 Revenue from firm contracts in 2016 and 2017 are NOK 1,059m and NOK 545m
 Counterparty risk:
- CAA (Certification of Charter Authorization) not renewed for one vessel on contract with Petrobras and consequently the contract is terminated
- Remaining 3 vessels on contract with Petrobras up for CAA renewal in January, March and May 2016
- Other key contracts already re-negotiated (Maersk, Total, Statoil and Deepocean) - Early termination risk reduced
 Total backlog of about NOK 5.6bn when full value of option contracts included (total value of NOK 2.8bn)
 Valuable negotiating position obtained through strong option contract coverage although terms are expected to be revised

Havila Shipping expects challenging market over the next years
 Current oil price not sustainable in the long term  Increased oil demand fuelled by low energy prices will eventually lead to oil
price increase and E&P spending growth  E&P spending expected to continue the decline in 2016 before recovering in
2017 on back of higher oil prices  OSV market expected to remain very challenging for 2016 and 2017.  Recovery expected from 2018 and onwards with market balance being
reached in 2019/2020  Large number of vessels returning from lay-up will dampen the recovery  Market effect of newbuildings uncertain
17

Segment considerations

iji'i ^ni>?r i w

PSV: Several vessels are currently on contracts which expire in 2016 and 2017. Due to current performance, unique vessel specifications and operational track record, Havila Shipping expects a relatively high renewal rate / option strike rate in this segment but at lower rates. Uncertainty with respect to Brazil vessels and CAA renewal.

Jta-r--«aKmMH

 HP- il , *·-

BB P ,:

AHTS: Dayrates and utilization in the next years assumed significantly lower than market average for the preceding 5 years.

| Subsea: Reduced utilisation of Havila Subsea in 2016 and 2017 before a moderate recovery in 2018 and 2019. Satisfactory utilisation expected for Havila Harmony and Havila Phoenix throughout the period.
