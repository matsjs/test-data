Quarterly Report
Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains forward-looking statements that relate to future events, including our future operating results and conditions, our prospects and our future financial performance and condition, all of which are largely based on our current expectations and projections. Known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. It is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the potential impact of these factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statement. These factors include, but are not limited to, (i) the downturn in oil markets and increased competition among offshore drillers, (ii) availability of capital and credit market volatility, (iii) local and global economic conditions, (iv) our anticipated growth strategies, (v) political, economic and financial pressures that impact our sole customer, PEMEX, and (vi) our future business development, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, our business model is highly leveraged, we have only one customer, PEMEX, and we operate in a highly competitive market, so new risk factors may emerge from time to time. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by words or phrases such as "may", "will", "expect", "anticipate", "target", "aim", "estimate", "intend", "plan", "believe", "potential", "continue", "is/are likely to" or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements made in this report relate only to events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in this report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should read this report with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect.

Quarterly Overview
(Units in US$)

Quarterly Report

Company Highlights
Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro S.A.P.I. de C.V. (referred to as "Oro Negro" or the "Company" herein) reports revenues of US$50.7M during the first quarter of 2016, in line with the US$49.0M registered during the fourth quarter of 2015.
Like every business in our industry, Oro Negro is facing significant challenges. Our challenges are a direct result of the challenges our only customer, PEMEX, also faces. We continue to partner with PEMEX to address the collective issues we face, but these challenges directly and negatively impacted our liquidity, which remains extremely limited. As a result, the Company must continue to make difficult choices on the timing for paying its obligations, while simultaneously ensuring that our rigs are operating safely and consistent with the expectations of PEMEX. The Company did not pay the outstanding principal and accrued interest in respect of the First Priority Oro Negro Impetus Pte.Ltd. Senior Secured Bond Issue 2014/2015 (the "2015 bonds" and referred to herein as the "US$175.0M bridge bond"), which amounts were due as of the maturity date of the 2015 Bonds on December 4, 2015; as well as the amortization payment and accrued interest in respect of the 7.5% Oro Negro Drilling Pte. Ltd. Senior Secured Bond Issue 2014/2019 (the "2019 bonds" and referred to herein as the "US$725.0M bond") that was due on January 24, 2016. It is worth noting that on April 29, 2016, Oro Negro successfully completed the restructuring of the Company's US$175.0M bridge bond and the US$725.0M bond upon obtaining close to unanimous approval of its bondholders. Pursuant to the debt restructuring, the 2015 Bonds were combined with the 2019 Bonds; this terminated the bond agreement governing the 2015 Bonds and converted the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest on the 2015 Bonds into outstanding principal as part of the 2019 Bonds. The restructuring also resulted in the issuance of new 2019 Bonds with a total outstanding principal amount of US$939.1M at an annual rate of 7.5% paid quarterly.
Despite recent financial difficulties, the Company continued to successfully execute on its operational strategy during the first quarter. Oro Negro's fleet achieved another quarter with high uptime levels, registering an average uptime of 99.8% during the first quarter of 2016. Laurus and Decus ended the first quarter with an uptime of 100.0%, offering the best performance of Oro Negro's fleet, followed by Fortius and Primus with average uptimes of 99.9% and 99.5% respectively.
Operational Results
As of March 31, 2016, our fleet consists of five premium jack-ups and one modular rig, providing enough scale to generate substantial operating synergies, and to position the Company as a relevant operator of high specification equipment in Mexico, with five of our rigs already under contract with PEMEX.
Oro Negro is committed to maintain the highest safety and environmental responsibility standards. We operate a Quality Management System (QMS) with its principles founded in our ZERO HARM policies; which are based upon ZERO HARM to people, environment, and equipment. No major incidents were reported during the first quarter of 2016.

We have been able to build a large contract backlog and provide a stable cash flow visibility for the upcoming years. The following table sets forth the amount of revenue backlog for our drilling units under contract as of March 31, 2016:

Contract backlog is calculated by multiplying the day rate of our drilling contracts by the number of contract days remaining, assuming a full uptime rate. The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation, customer reimbursable, and bonuses.
It is worth noting that as a part of the day rate renegotiation with Pemex, which reflects a day rate of US$130k for a 12-month period starting June 2015, the Company signed an amendment to the contracts of the rigs under operation providing one additional year of contract extension per jack-up.
Oro Negro's rigs are currently located in the bay of Campeche based in the Mexican Gulf of Mexico performing both exploratory and development drilling activities for PEMEX.
