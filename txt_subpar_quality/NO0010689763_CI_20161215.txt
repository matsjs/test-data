Joint Administrators' Report
1. Introduction
1.1 Chad Griffin and Lisa Rickelton were appointed as Joint Administrators of the Companies on 6 January 2016. Pursuant to Paragraphs 76(2) and 78(2)(b)(i) of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986, Rule 2.112 of the Insolvency Rules 1986 (as amended) ("the Rules") and Rule 2.44 of the Insolvency (Scotland) Rules 1986 ("the Scottish Rules"), we are writing to Secured Lenders to request to extend the period of the administrations of the Companies by one year to 6 January 2018.
1.2 Pursuant to Rule 2.47(3B) of the Insolvency Rules 1986 (as amended) ("the Rules") and Rule 2.38 of the Insolvency (Scotland) Rules 1986 ("the Scottish Rules") we are required to send creditors a report setting out what has happened in the administrations during the period since our last report, from 6 July 2016 to 5 December 2016 ("the Period").
1.3 Statutory information pertaining to the Companies is set out in Appendix A. On 27 May 2016, Iona re-registered as a private limited company.
1.4 As insolvency practitioners we are bound by the Insolvency Code of Ethics. Prior to our appointment we considered potential ethical threats in undertaking the administrations in accordance with the Code, and we did not consider that there were any matters preventing us taking these appointments.
1.5 Following a meeting of Iona's creditors on 17 June 2016, the Joint Administrators were also appointed as Joint Supervisors of the CVA in relation to Iona.
1.6 No creditors committee has been formed in the Administrations and no creditors committee has been proposed for the Iona CVA.
1.7 This report together with the appendices contains information in relation to the activities undertaken in the Period, as well as some information relating to the full period since our appointment on 6 January 2016. This includes receipts and payments into the insolvency estate (Appendices B and C) and the Administrators' time costs in accordance with Statement of Insolvency Practice 9 ("SIP9") (Appendices D and E).

Administrators' remuneration
1.9 In our Statement of Proposals dated 9 February 2016 ("the Proposals"), we proposed that we be remunerated on the basis of time costs incurred by us and our staff properly spent in carrying out the Administrations. The Proposals were deemed approved on 23 February 2016. Details of the rules in relation to Administrators' remuneration together with details of our time costs to date are set out in Appendices C and D.
1.10 Time costs and disbursements incurred since our appointment for Huntington amount to £109,013 (plus VAT). Of this amount £93,093 (plus VAT) has been billed.

by the applicant(s) of the report detailing the remuneration and/or expenses being complained of, in accordance with Rule 2.109 of the Rules.
1.16 By virtue of Rule 2.39(9) of the Scottish Rules, in respect of Iona, our fees will be determined by the secured creditors. The Creditors' Guide referred to in clause 1.11 provides more information in relation to the Administrators' remuneration.
Creditors' Right to Request Information 1.17 Any secured creditor or unsecured creditor with the support of at least 5% in value of the unsecured creditors or, with leave
of the Court, may, in writing, request the Administrators of Huntington to provide additional information regarding remuneration or expenses to that already supplied with this document. Such requests must be made within 21 days of receipt of this report, in accordance with Rule 2.47(1)(fa) and 2.48A of the Rules.
1.18 Similarly, should creditors of Iona require further information, please mark any such requests for the attention of William Marsden and post to FTI Consulting LLP, 200 Aldersgate Street, London, EC1A 4HD.

Notes: 1. Return to Secured Creditors excludes the $57.1m recovery of cash held by Iona subject to the Secured Creditors' fixed charge which was enforced by the Secured Creditors on 22 December 2015. 2. Employees entered into a settlement agreement in full and final settlement of any claims against Iona. 3. Returns to unsecured creditors are assumed to be by virtue of the Prescribed Part only for Huntington. 4. The return for unsecured creditors of Iona would be from the CVA only. Since the funding for the CVA derives from purchase consideration on a share sale it remains uncertain. As such a range is presented. 5. Estimated return to secured creditors shown as a combination of both Companies due to cross funding.

2.1 The estimates above represent the possible return to creditors based on information currently known and may be subject to change, and assume a pro-rata return to creditors of the same class in accordance with UK insolvency law. Unsecured creditors rank behind both secured and preferential creditors, whilst shareholders rank behind all classes of creditor.
2.2 Further details of the estimated returns to each class of creditor are set out in section 6 of this report.

3. Conduct of the Administrations
Purpose of the Administrations 3.1 Pursuant to Paragraph 3 of the Schedule B1 of the Act, the purpose of the administration of Iona is to rescue the Company
as a going concern. 3.2 Pursuant to Paragraph 3 of the Schedule B1 of the Act, the purpose of the administration of Huntingdon is realising property
in order to make a distribution to creditors. 3.3 We considered that the administrations would give a better outcome than could be achieved in liquidations of the Companies
as the appointment process could be conducted quickly, with the consent of the Secured Lender.
Shares in lona/Orlando and Kells Licenses 3.4 As set out in our last report a CVA was approved on 17 June 2016 in order to facilitate a sale of the shares in Iona and the
Orlando / Kells licenses. This process was approved by 100% of creditors who voted in person or by proxy at the meeting. 3.5 The anticipated sale to Bridge Petroleum 2 Limited (the Purchaser) was originally scheduled to complete in late July. Further
extensions to the backstop date in the sale and purchase agreement ("SPA") until 31 August 2016 and then to 31 October 2016 were given during the Period to enable Bridge to secure the Orlando development funding. 3.6 As part of the agreement to grant an extension to 31 October, Bridge agreed to cover operating costs of c.£150k per month. We received £447k to cover operating costs during the Period. 3.7 On 16 November 2016 Bridge advised that they were unable to complete the transaction under the SPA as a result of one of their proposed funders determining that the Orlando development no longer met their investment criteria. 3.8 We have been assessing alternative options, including a potential sale of Iona to alternative parties. We have now signed an exclusivity agreement with one party in relation to a sale of the shares in Iona with a view to completion of a transaction by 31 January 2017.
Trent and Tyne License 3.9 As advised in the original Administrators' proposals a consensual settlement in relation to Iona's interest in the Trent and
Tyne License was agreed with Perenco and nil cash consideration passed.
West Wick 3.10 As reported previously, on 3 February 2016 we signed a sale of Iona's interest in the West Wick license for $1.76m to
Chevron North Sea Limited. (`Chevron'). Transaction proceeds are deferred and contingent, linked to the approval of a FDP. 3.11 The transaction completed on 28 June 2016. Transaction proceeds are intended to be assigned to the Security Trustee
effective from completion of the sale of Iona.
Transactions relating to other licenses held by Iona 3.12 At the date of appointment Iona also held a working interest in three other exploration licenses; Ronan & Oran, Fleetwind and
Farne & Lundy. All three licenses have now been relinquished.
Huntington licenses and other entitlements 3.13 As reported previously, in addition to the 15% interest in the Huntington field, Huntington also owns the following
entitlements: 1.2% royalty entitlement from Premier Oil UK Limited ("Premier"); 0.6% royalty entitlement from Noreco Denmark A/S ("Noreco"); and 0.75% disproportionate lifting entitlement ("DLE") with Eon.
3.14 As previously reported, we agreed a termination of the royalty entitlement with Premier for $0.9m, which was received on 25 January 2016.

Joint Administrators' Report
3.15 No interest was received in the marketing process in relation to Huntington's 15% license interest, and a default was persisting at the commencement of the administration. On 29 January 2016 we received notice from the joint operating partners stating that, pursuant to the default, they were exercising their rights to acquire Huntington's interest. Discussions are ongoing with Premier in relation to this process.
Receipts and payments during the Period 3.16 Please find at Appendix B the receipts and payments accounts for both Iona and Huntington. Narrative in relation to the
receipts and payments is included at Appendix C. Taxation 3.17 We have notified HM Revenue and Customs of our appointment and appropriate filings have been made to support the
Companies' corporation tax and VAT positions at the date of the administrations. Iona has received a VAT refund of £1.9m. In addition Huntington has received a VAT refund of £19k. 3.18 VAT returns will continue to be submitted within the relevant timeframes.
Statutory Investigations 3.19 We have undertaken our investigation work in accordance with SIP2 including a review of the books and records of the
Companies in order to understand the realisable assets of the Companies and comparing these to the values in the directors' statement of affairs. 3.20 The data gathered from our investigations assisted with our statutory duties, pursuant to the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, to review the conduct of all directors who served in respect of the Companies in the 3 year period prior to the date of the Administrations. We have concluded our review and have submitted a final return to the Insolvency Service. 3.21 Should any creditors have any further relevant information in relation to directors' conduct, they should provide details in writing to the Administrators.
4. Remaining matters requiring extension of Administration
Iona
Shares in lona/Orlando and Kells Licenses 4.1 As previously detailed we are currently assessing alternative options regarding the sale of the shares in Iona and Orlando/
Kells licenses as a result of the withdrawal of Bridge. Atlantic Petroleum 4.2 We are currently in discussions with Atlantic regarding an account reconciliation for amounts owed under the JOA license. We
anticipate that this should be settled shortly and outstanding amounts will be transferred. 4.3 We are also in discussions with Atlantic in relation to the options for the Orlando and Kells licenses.
Huntington
Unsecured Creditor Dividend 4.4 As set out below we anticipate a dividend will be payable to unsecured creditors, arising from the Prescribed Part. Where
payments will be made to unsecured creditors from the Prescribed Part only, the administrator is able to distribute these funds without first converting the administration to a liquidation.
Huntington License Interests 4.5 Discussions remain ongoing with Premier in relation to the novation of the Huntington License.

5. Estimated Outcomes
Secured creditors
5.1 At the date of the appointments the Secured Creditors were owed $263m by the Companies. The Secured Creditors held a number of securities which were listed in the SIP 16 letter to creditors and included as Appendix G in the Administrators' proposals dated 9 February 2016.
5.2 The amount due to the secured creditors was net of $57.1m restricted cash which had been distributed to the Security Trustee prior to the date of appointment. Of this amount $50m was distributed by the Security Trustee to bondholders with the remaining $7m held as contingency.
5.3 No further funds have been distributed to the secured creditors from the Companies at this stage.
5.4 Conditional upon the approval of the FDP, West Wick would result in realisations of $1.76m.
5.5 The level of future net recoveries to the Security Trustee in relation to the Administration of Iona and Huntington is uncertain at this stage.
Preferential creditors
5.6 There are no preferential creditors in either Iona or Huntington.
Unsecured creditors 5.7 Unsecured creditors rank behind both secured and preferential creditors.
5.8 Under Section 176A of the Act where after 15 September 2003 the company has granted a creditor a floating charge, a proportion of the net property of the company achieved from floating charge asset realisations must be made available for the unsecured creditors ("the Prescribed Part").
5.9 There are unlikely to be sufficient funds to repay the Secured Creditors in full, therefore returns to unsecured creditors will come from the Prescribed Part only (Huntington) and potential CVA distribution (Iona).
5.10 The Prescribed Part applies where there are net floating charge realisations (i.e. after costs of realisation) available to unsecured creditors and is calculated as follows:
· 50% of net property up to £10k
· Plus 20% of net property in excess of £10k
· Subject to a maximum of £600k
5.11 We currently expect the Prescribed Part in Huntington to reach the maximum of £600k.
5.12 The CVA expressly disapplies the obligation under s176A(2) of the Act for the Administrators to set aside the prescribed part. Any distribution to Iona's unsecured creditors will therefore be a CVA distribution. This will only be payable however if a sale of Iona can be executed. Failing that the CVA would fail and unsecured creditors would retain their claims as unsecured creditors. However, no Prescribed Part would be anticipated from Iona in such circumstances.
5.13 In respect of Iona, pursuant to Paragraph 115(2) the administrators are able to provide notice to the Registrar of Companies of the fact that there are insufficient funds to enable a distribution to creditors, other than the Prescribed Part. Given the inherent uncertainty regarding whether a Prescribed Part distribution will be payable as set out above, we have chosen not to make a filing at this time.
5. Next report and further questions
6.1 Pursuant to Rule 2.47(3B) of the Rules we are required to provide a progress report to all creditors of Huntington within one month of the end of the next six months from the end of the Period, or when the Administration comes to an end, whichever is sooner.
6.2 In respect of Iona, Rule 2.38 of the Scottish Rules indicates that our next report is required to cover the period of six months from the date of the last accounting period. As the accounting period covered by this report is to 5 December 2016, pursuant to Rule 2.44 of the Scottish Rules, we consider that the relevant accounting period is therefore for the period of six months subsequent to the Period, rather than for the six months since the accounting period ended 5 July 2016 (as covered by our previous progress report).

Prior to the appointment of the Administrators the proposed Administrators' initial engagement letter was between FTI Consulting LLP, Farallon Capital Europe LLP, Sparinvest, Southpaw Asset Management LLP, and was dated 20 February 2015. A subsequent amendment to these terms was made in the addendum letter between FTI Consulting LLP, Nordic Trustee and Iona Energy Company (UK) plc (Iona) was dated 1 June 2015. The scope comprised:
· provide an overview on latest short term cash flow forecast for period to 31 March 2015; · comment on the ability to defer timing of commitments and associated implications on the Orlando development plan; · undertake an assessment of the Orlando development plan, including technical and financial assessment and financials; · undertake a high level technical assessment of Huntington, the options for extending production and decommissioning
costs; · review the latest financial forecasts for the period to Orlando first oil; and · assess secured creditor recoveries and provide secured creditor support in any restructuring proposals, proposed

From 17 November 2015 to the date of the Companies' administrations, FTI has provided the following services:
· assisting with contingency planning for the potential Administration of the Companies; · assisting management with transaction structuring; · preparing for the Administration appointments and related logistics, including site closure planning and employee
notifications; and · providing general support in the period prior to the Administration appointments.
Our fees incurred in relation to these advisory services for the period to 17 November 2015 totaled £1.1m. This was billed, and paid by the Companies prior to the date of our appointment as Administrators. Fees incurred for the period 18 November 2015 to 6 January 2016, being the date of our appointments, totaling £333k have been billed and paid.

The work performed prior to our appointment enabled the Companies' Administration to proceed as efficiently and as practically possible.
We are not aware of any other costs or expenses incurred in relation to the Companies by another party qualified to act as an insolvency practitioner in the period prior to our appointment as Administrators, in respect of work with a view to placing the Companies into Administration.

Tax · Communications with relevant tax authorities including the filing of post appointment tax returns. · Filing pre appointment tax returns. · Pursuing VAT refunds. · Tax support for disposal transactions. Reporting · Preparing statutory communication with creditors including CVA proposals In addition the Administrators have incurred Category 1 (out of pocket) expenses of £5,933 and no Category 2 expenses during the Period.

Further details in relation to this can be found at Appendix F together with additional information in relation to our policy on staffing, the use of subcontractors, and details of our current charge out rates by staff grade. Administrators' fee estimate Fee estimates of £665,048 for Iona and £238,098 for Huntington were included in the Administrators proposals. The time costs incurred to date are £1,239,313 in relation to the administration of Iona and £113,758 in relation to the administration of Huntington. Time costs for Iona have exceeded the estimate due to the protracted timeframe and complexity of the transaction.

We consider that the Huntington estimate remains appropriate. Details of the further work we propose to undertake is as follows Administration and planning · Formalities in respect of the Administration together with the planning, and execution of, an appropriate Administration exit

Joint Administrators' Report

Appendix F - Additional Information in relation to Administrators' fees pursuant to SIP9
Detailed below is FTI's policy in relation to:
· staff allocation and the use of sub-contractors;
· professional advisors; and
· disbursements.
Staff allocation and the use of subcontractors
Our general approach to resourcing our assignments is to allocate staff with the skills and experience to meet the specific requirements of the case.
The constitution of the case team will usually consist of a Senior Managing Director, Managing Director, Director, Senior Consultant and Consultant. The exact constitution of the case team will depend on the anticipated size and complexity of the assignment.
With regard to support staff, we would advise that time spent by cashiers in relation to specific tasks on an assignment is charged. Only if there is a large block of time incurred by a member of the secretarial team, e.g., report compilation and distribution, do we seek to charge and recover our time in this regard.
Professional advisors
On this assignment we have used the professional advisors listed below. We have also indicated alongside, the basis of our fee arrangement with them, which is subject to review on a regular basis.

Name of professional advisor
CMS Cameron McKenna LLP and Thomessen (legal advice) Akin Gump LLP (legal advice - bondholder & ad m in istra tors) HBJ Gateley (Huntington license matters) Appleby (Cayman law advice) Insolvency Support Services Limited RSM (payroll services) Sweeney Kincaid (asset realisations)

Basis of fee arrangement
Hourly rate and disbursements

Fixed fee per payroll Percentage of realisations

Fees paid to date (£)
586,226
1,002,790
23,680 nil nil
2,660 7,995

Our choice was based on our view of their experience and ability to perform this type of work, the complexity and nature of the assignment and the basis of our fee arrangement with them.
We have utilized the services of other teams within FTI Consulting LLP to assist with the Administration processes. The fees of our tax, technology and strategic communication teams have been included in our SIP9 analysis provided to creditors of the Companies and allocated to the work streams and entities to which their work related.
We consider that the rates chargeable for these services are in line with general market practice and that the service is comparable to similar firms of professional advisors. In addition, by working closely with our internal teams, we believe a more coordinated and cost-effective approach to the Administration work streams has been possible.
Disbursements
Category 1 disbursements do not require approval by creditors. The type of disbursements that may be charged as a Category 1 disbursement to a case generally comprise of external supplies of incidental services specifically identifiable to the case, such as postage, case advertising, invoiced travel and external printing, room hire and document storage. Also chargeable will be any properly reimbursed expenses incurred by personnel in connection with the case.
Category 2 disbursements do require approval from creditors. These disbursements can include costs incurred which relate to payments due to associated companies for the provision of services to the office holder.

Name and address of creditor:

Amount claimed in the Administration: (Including VAT) Signature of creditor: Name of creditor: Telephone: E-mail: Date:

£_______________________ ____________________________________ ____________________________________ ____________________________________ ____________________________________ __________/_________ /___________

Please provide appropriate documentation in support of your claim.
If you are registered for VAT the amount claimed should include VAT even if VAT bad debt relief has been claimed under the Value Added Tax Act 1994.

Please return this form when you have completed it to William Marsden at FTI Consulting LLP, 200 Aldersgate Street, London, EC1A 4HD or email it to william.marsden@fticonsulting.com.
Creditors registered for VAT may be able to claim VAT bad debt relief in accordance with Section 36 Value Added Tax Act 1994. In broad terms relief is available when the debt is six months old and "written off" by the creditor entering it on his VAT refunds-for-bad-debts-account.
Claims lodged in the Administration should be gross, including any VAT element. If/when dividends are paid, creditors who have claimed VAT bad debt relief must apportion the dividend between VAT and the net element of their claim and account to HM Customs and Excise for the VAT element through their VAT return.
Insolvency Practitioners have no role in administering VAT bad debt relief under the Value Added Tax Act 1994. Creditors who are uncertain how to claim should contact their VAT office or take professional advice.

(2) The administrator complies with this paragraph by either-- (a) providing all of the information asked for, or (b) so far as the administrator considers that-- (i) the time or cost of preparation of the information would be excessive, or (ii) disclosure of the information would be prejudicial to the conduct of the administration or might reasonably be expected to lead to violence against any person, or (iii) the administrator is subject to an obligation of confidentiality in respect of the information, giving reasons for not providing all of the information.
(3) Any creditor, who need not be the same as the creditor who requested further information under paragraph (1), may apply to the court within 21 days of-- (c) the giving by the administrator of reasons for not providing all of the information asked for, or (d) the expiry of the 14 days provided for in paragraph (1), and the court may make such order as it thinks just.
(4) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (3), the order of the court under that paragraph may extend the period of 8 weeks provided for in Rule 2.109(1B) by such further period as the court thinks just.

If the application is not dismissed, the court shall fix a venue for it to be heard, and give notice to the applicant accordingly.
(3) The applicant shall, at least 14 days before the hearing, send to the administrator a notice stating the venue and accompanied by a copy of the application, and of any evidence which the applicant intends to adduce in support of it.
