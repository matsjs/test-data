Background

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as ("Loan Trustee") for the above mentioned Bond issues where Petrojack ASA (in bankruptcy) is the borrower (the "Borrower").

Reference is made to the summons to the Bondholders' meeting for the NOK 2012 Bond dated 19 November 2010, the summons to the Bondholders' meeting for the USD 2012 Bond dated 12 November 2010 and the summons to the Bondholders' meeting for the 2010 Bond dated 7 April 2010, together referred to as (the "Summons"),

The Rig owned by Petrojack IV Pte. Ltd. was sold on 30 November 2010 and the net proceeds from the sale will be distributed according to the jSummons.

For all three loans:

Record Date for the payment is End'of Business 21 December 2010.

Payment Date is 2 3 'December 2010. This is the date on which the Bondholders having their bondholding registered directly in the Norwegian Securities Depository ("VPS") will receive payment. The Loan Trustee cannot guarantee that beneficial owners holding bonds through nominee accounts, will receive payment on the Payment Date, as this will depend on the redistribution from the relevant nominee.

Interest payments due and not paid prior to the Bankruptcy of the Borrower are registered in VPS as separate claims. As these claims do not necessarily belong to the holder of the respective bond on the Record Date, separate payments will be made towards all groups of claims. Distribution among the claims under each individual ISIN, is made according to the underlying security documents. The basis for all calculations is claim amounts including interest for late payment until 30 November 2010 and any premium according to the relevant bond loan agreements.
