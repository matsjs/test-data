Additional Risk Factors:

The rating agencies may, from time to time in the future, change the way they analyse securities with features similar to the Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes. This may include, for example, changes to the relationship between ratings assigned to an issuer's senior securities and ratings assigned to securities with features similar to the Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes, sometimes called "notching". If the rating agencies change their practices for rating these securities in the future, and the rating of the Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes are subsequently lowered, that could have a negative impact on the trading price of the Hybrid Tier 1 Capital Notes.
