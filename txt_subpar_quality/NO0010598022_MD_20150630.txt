To the bondholders in:
ISIN: NO 001 059802.2 -14 per cent NBT AS Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2010/2013
Oslo, 30 June 2015
Maturity Date 30 June 2015 - payment to be made 2 July 2015 Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the abovementioned bond issue (the "Bond Issue"), which is documented in the bond agreement dated 29 December 2010 (the "Bond Agreement"). NBT AS is the issuer of the Bonds (the "Issuer"). Capitalised terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings ascribed to such terms in the Bond Agreement. Today is the Maturity Date for the Bond Issue, and the repayment of the Bonds has been financed by issuance of a new bond issue. However, due to a time lag between the issue of new bonds and the actual payment to the Bondholders, the Issuer will repay the Bond Issue, including interest for late payment, 2 July 2015.
Yours sincerely Nordic Trustee ASA
