Highlights from the quarter

Please note that all figures on pages 2 and 3 are pro forma including Odin Kapital, which was acquired in Q4 2017, and included synergies. Moreover, revenue, EBITDA and net profit in Q3 2017 are all positively affected by one-off effects following the adoption of the accrued revenue principle (see note #3 for further information). To adjust for this one-time effect, and to reflect the impact of accrued revenue as if it was adopted for the full year, the revenue, EBITDA and net profit included on page 2 and 3 have been adjusted accordingly. For stand-alone Melin Group figures, excluding Odin Kapital, see page 4 onwards.

Letter from the CEO

The third quarter 2017 was a solid quarter from a financial perspective, demonstrating a continued strong underlying operational performance in both Melin Medical and Melin Collectors. Melin Group revenues and EBITDA increased significantly compared to both the corresponding quarter iast year and the previous quarter, in line with our expectations and ambitions.
Although the Odin Kapital transaction was not closed until the fourth quarter, we have chosen to present pro-forma figures including Odin Kapital in this quarterly report in order to present bond investors with an accurate like-for-like comparison as early as possible.
Revenue for the third quarter 2017 ended at NOK 96.0 million, including one-off items, representing an increase of 86.0 % from the same quarter last year (Q3 2016: NOK 51.6 million). Underlying organic growth, year over year, was 36.3 %, excluded Odin Kapital was growth 38.0 %. EBITDA rose to NOK 56.3 million, up from NOK 16.4 million last year. Total solutions in operation-terminals and invoicing solutions--increased from 1,545 in the third quarter 2016 to 1,768 in the third quarter 2017. Increasing the number of terminals is important as it creates a domino effect on revenue, driving the number of invoices generated and the following debt collection. Churn remained low in the third quarter.
For the senior management of Melin Group, iarge parts of the third quarter was spent readying the group for the next growth phase. We completed the due diligence and prepared the acquisition of Odin Kapital, and in parallel completed preparations for the contemplated issuing of new bonds.
We were very pleased with how the European investment market responded to the Melin Group business case. Subsequent to the quarter, we completed a NOK 1,000 million senior secured bond issue and a NOK 350 million 2nd iien bond issue. The bond financing will provide us with significant financial flexibility going forward, and enable us to capitalize on the upside potential that Melin Collectors in particular represents. It will also allow us to further increase our focus on product development, thereby maintaining our market ieading position for patient administration systems, to the benefit of our customers.
In the fourth quarter, we will start integrating Odin Kapital into the Melin Group. We aim to harvest significant synergies from this acquisition. The effect of these will gradually increase throughout 2018.
Best regards,

INGVILL HESTENES

Note 2--Accounting principles
This interim report has been prepared in accordance with Norske regnskapsstandarder (NGAAP). The accounting principles applied are the same as those applied in the latest annual reports of Melin Medical and Melin Collectors unless otherwise stated below. This report has not been subject to review by the Melin Group's auditor. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with NGAAP requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to make certain judgments in applying the group's accounting policies.

Note 3--Accrued revenue
Up until Q2 2017, Melin Group recognized revenue from invoice fee, reminder fee and debt collection fee at the time when the fee/claim was settled and paid. After gaining more experience and collecting empirical data regarding resolution rates and expected revenue from different patient segments, Melin Medical,4S and Melin Collector,4S have in Q3 2017 adopted the accrued revenue principle, where recognition of invoice fee, reminder fee and debt collection fee is based on the expected revenues and resolution rates for the active claims / portfolio of claims. This principle for accrued revenue is in iine with the principle applied by similar debt collection companies in the Nordic market.
By applying the accrued revenue principle in Q3 2017, Melin Group had the following one-off effects in the profit and loss statement for YTD 2017 (equaling the accumulated accrued revenue as of 31 December 2016):
· One-off effect on revenue of MNOK 47.6 · One-off effect on cost of materials of MNOK -2.9 · One-off effect on EBITDA of MNOK 44.7
As per 30 September 2017 the total accrued revenue per Q3 2017 was MNOK 72.5, the cost of materials was MNOK -6.3 and the EBITDA was MNOK 66.2.

Note 4--Consolidated financial statements
HI Bidco AS acquired Helseinnovasjon AS on 1 November 2017. Thus, as of 30 September 2017 (Q3 2017), HI Bidco AS did not exist. The consolidated financial statements for Q3 2017 presented here, reflects the financial statements of Helseinnovasjon AS with subsidiaries as of 30 September 2017.
Please note that as Odin Kapital AS was acquired 3 November 2017, this entity is not included in the Melin Group figures. Also note that at the 30 June 2017, a demerger was carried out in Helseinnovasjon AS, where the shares in the subsidiary PatientSkyAS was transferred to Helseinnovasjon II AS. Thus, in the consolidated financial statements presented here, PatientSky AS has been treated as an investment in associated companies (i.e. not included in the consolidated Melin Group figures).
