Management's Review
Summary Jacob Holm & Sønner Holding A/S and its subsidiaries ("Jacob Holm", the "Company" or the "Group") con cluded its first quarter of the financial year 2017 with revenues of DKK 582 million and an EBITDA of DKK 31 million. Compared to the previous year, the Group started with a weaker quarter into the financial year. The main reason for the lower topline was the continued tight competitive situation especially in Consumer Wipes in North Amer ica. The Company launched the new brand identity at the global nonwoven show in Geneva (Switzerland) in early April 2017. Furthermore, the Group issued a new senior secured note in the Nordic capital markets. The settle ment of the new bonds took place on March 31, 2017 while the redemption of the 2014 bonds only occurred on April 25, 2017, inflating the balance sheet at the end of Q1 2017.

Financial Review
Revenue Revenue in Q l 2017 increased by DKK 20 million or 3% to DKK 582 million compared with DKK 562 million in Q4 2016. The competitive situation continued to be tight, especially in Consumer Wipes in North America. Operating expenses Cost of goods sold in Q l 2017 totalled DKK 511 million representing 88% of revenue compared with DKK 472 million or 84% in Q4 2016. The higher cost of goods sold were a result of an accumulation of lower production yields on selected campaigns and a series of trial activities for product innovations. Other operating expenses amounted to DKK 39 million or 7% of revenue in Q1 2017 compared with DKK 41 million or 7% in Q4 2016. Depreciation charges of DKK 33 million in Q1 2017 were in line with the previous quarter. EBITDA The Group delivered an EBITDA of DKK 31 million in Q1 2017 compared to DKK 50 million in Q4 2016, repre senting a decrease in EBITDA margin. The margin decrease is mainly attributable to an unfavourable product mix and lower production performance. Financial income and expenses The Group's financial income and expenses related to borrowing costs for the bonds and other financing ar rangements were DKK 11 million in Q1 2017 compared to DKK 10 million in Q4 2016. Taxes The Group reported a tax expense of DKK 9 million in Q1 2017, compared with DKK 0 million in Q4 2016. Net profit The net loss was DKK 8 million in Q1 2017 compared with a net profit of DKK 16 million in Q4 2016. Equity Equity decreased by DKK 12 million in Q1 2017 based on the negative result for the period and changes in ex change rates. Net debt The Group has issued new bonds with a nominal amount of EUR 100 million and a maturity of 5 years. The net proceeds were to be used to refinance the existing bonds and for general corporate purposes. The net debt at the end of Q1 2017 was DKK 808 million compared with DKK 817 million at the end of Q4 2016.
