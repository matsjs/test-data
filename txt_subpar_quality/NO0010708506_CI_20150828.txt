Q2 2015 Update from the board of directors

Financial performance Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its subsidiaries, hereafter "the Group" experienced a solid Q2 2015. Challenging markets wherein the Group operates however still demand intensive focus. Revenue developments were positive both on testing services and surveys. Overall EBITDA did meet expectations.
The overall sales of the group showed an increase of 3.3% vs Q2 2014 and on YTD basis an increase of 2.6%. Contracted testing volumes have picked up in Q2 and are now flat vs last year. Demand for surveys continues to be strong vs YTD 2014 with a 19% increase.
Costs (adjusted for post-acquisition related costs) of the Group in Q2 2015 were 2% higher then Q2 2014 (YTD 1.1%) reflecting amongst others the growth of demand for surveys. As a result the Group's Q2 2015 EBITDA increased to USD 3.317 thousand (2014: USD 3.086 thousand).

The Group closed Q2 2015 financials with a net loss of USD 43 thousand (2014: USD - 590 thousand) which is mainly driven by (timing) difference of exceptional expenses.
Both exceptional items and capital expenditures are significantly lower then last year reflecting the ending of carve out activities and leading to increase in cash.
Organizational changes Effective 1 May 2015 Gerard Rohaan was appointed as Chief Executive Officer. Gerard Rohaan will succeed Eirik Andreassen who has stepped down as Chief Executive Officer.

Explanatory notes to condensed consolidated interim financial statements

1. Reporting entity
Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. is a company domiciled in The Netherlands. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as at and for the six months ended 30 June 2015 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The Group primarily provides testing and survey services to the Maritime industry.
2. Basis of accounting
This condensed interim consolidated financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim financial reporting. It does not include all the information required for a complete set of IFRS financials statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant for an understanding of the changes in the Group's financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014.
This condensed consolidated interim financial statement was authorised for issue by the Company's Board of Management on 28 August 2015.

3. Use of judgments and estimates
In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant judgements made by management in applying the group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014.
4. Restatement of 2014 quarterly reports
The results presented here for the period ending June 30, 2014 are different from what was published last year. June 30, 2014 results were prepared with the best knowledge available at that time but in the course of 2014 better insight has developed as a result of amongst others PPA valuation, set up of IFRS reporting and annual closing 2014. The 2014 quarterly results have been changed accordingly for comparison purposes. An overview of the differences is presented below.
