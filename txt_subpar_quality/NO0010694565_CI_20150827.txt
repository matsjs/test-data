Balance sheet per 30.06.2015_________________________________________________________________________ Total assets were USD 227,4 million compared to USD 237,2 million as of 30thJune 2014.
Tangible assets amounted to USD 200,4 million compared to USD 205,8 million at 30.06.2014.
Based on valuations from two independent shipbrokers at 30.06.2015 the average value of the Vessels were USD 182 million. The group's current assets were USD 18,2 million (USD 26,1 million) of which cash equivalents corresponds to USD 11,1 million (USD 16,2 million at 30.06.2014).
Book equity as per 30.06.2015 was USD 76,3 million based on conversion of EUR to USD at rates of delivery dates for the vessels corresponding to USD 0,50 per share, while value adjusted equity was USD 57,9 million corresponding to USD 0,38 per share.
At the end of the quarter the Group had long term interest bearing debt in the amount of USD 150 million. The working capital is USD 14,5 million at 30.06.2015 compared to USD 15,5 million at 30.06.2014.
Market outlook and the Petrobras Contracts____________________________________________________________ Four of the Vessels are employed on long term contracts with Petrobras until June 2018 and the gross value of these contracts are approximately USD 160 million. The contracts are based on yearly renewal of the CAA (Certificate of Charter Authorization) and AIT (Registration Certificate of temporary foreign Vessel) which are the license to operate in Brazilian waters with foreign flag.
Brazilian flagged vessels (same specification and without employment) are today in position to use their rights according to Brazilian law to block circulation's of foreign flagged vessels. These blocking rights are used at the time of renewal of the CAA and AIT certificates. Without the certificates the foreign flagged vessels are not allowed to operate in Brazilian waters. A non-renewal of the CAA and AIT certificates due to blocking can lead to a Petrobras cancellation of the contracts. Historically Petrobras has lifted all blocking situations related to all long term foreign contracts by employing the Brazilian flagged vessels.
Two of the WWS Vessels are blocked but are on hire according to contract. The blocking situation expects to be clarified during September 2015 based on lifting the blockage and renewal of the CAA and AIT certificates.
The remaining two Vessels are for the time being working in the spot market in the North Sea, but will be laid up in beginning of September.
The cash flow from the four Vessels covers financial expenses and lay up costs for the two other Vessels. World Wide Supply is working with potential strategic alternatives based on today's employment of the vessels and the preferred transaction structure for the parties involved,
The Board of Directors expects a challenging market for the rest of 2015 as well as for 2016. The four Vessels on the Petrobras contracts have performed very well in the first half year 2015 with an average utilization of 96,35% including off-hire with 12 days in June for one of the Vessels due to a collision. This Vessel has been on Loss of Hire Insurance in July and until 7thof August and then on-hire with the Charterer.
Financial risk_____________________________________________________________ The Group uses financial instruments to manage its foreign currency risk in charter hire. The Group has fixed rate on the long-term debt so there is no risk to interest rate.

W orld W ide S u pp ly
The Group has an active approach to currency risk and uses foreign exchange contracts that reduce this risk. The Group's long-term debt is in US dollars. It is signed long-term time charters for four of its Vessels with rate in US dollars. Payment to the company in that currency has a cash flow that covers the interest on its long-term loan in US dollars. Thus there is no risk associated with the payment of interest on long-term debt.
Employees______________________________________________________________________ The Group had at June 30th 2015 188 employees of which 184 sailors including hired personnel.
Responsibility statement____________________________________________________________________________ We hereby declare that to the best of our knowledge, the information in this report provides a fair and true description of the Group's assets, liabilities, financial position and result as a whole. We also declare that this interim report gives a true and fair view of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, as well as a description of the most central risks and uncertainty factors that the Group is facing.
