To the bondholders in: ISEV: NO 001 036763.4 -11.625 per cent SeaMetric International AS Senior Secured
Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012 Oslo, 20 December 2013
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM" or the "Trustee" or the "Bond Trustee") acts as trustee for the holders of bonds (the "Bondholders") in the loan agreement dated 30 May 2007 with ISIN NO 001 036763.4 described in the loan agreement " 11.625 per cent SeaMetric International AS Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012" (the "Bond Agreement") where SeaMetric International AS is the issuer (the "Borrower", the "Company" or "SeaMetric"), and whereby the Bondholders made available a loan in the maximum aggregate amount of USD 105,000,000 (the "Loan"). All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Bond Agreement, unless otherwise stated. SeaMetric filed for bankruptcy on 13 January 2010. The liquidation proceedings have resulted in distributions from SeaMetric estate in bankruptcy. On 26 January 2012, a total of NOK 16,000,000 was distributed among all creditors with unsecured claims. The Bond Trustee received an amount of NOK 14,033,334.55 on behalf of the Bondholders. After deducting fees and cost, the Bond Trustee carried out a partial distribution (via VPS) in the abovementioned Loan on 8 of February 2012. The distribution corresponded to 4.30095 % (flat) of the face value. The record date for the distribution was 3 February 2012. On 8 February 2013, a second distribution was made, and an amount of USD 446,735 was distributed prorate among the Bondholders. The record date for the distribution was 4 February 2013. The funds did not cover the entire Loan including interest and expenses. Accordingly, the Bondholders have uncovered claims against the company. The administrator of the Estate has now informed the Bond Trustee that there is now no prospect of additional payments to the Bondholders from the Estate. To stop additional cost to accrue, the Bond Trustee has decided that any process related to the Bond Issue will be terminated, and the Bond will therefore cease to exist in the Norwegian Security Depository ("VPS"). Further information to the Bondholders will be available on the web-site www.stamdata.no.
