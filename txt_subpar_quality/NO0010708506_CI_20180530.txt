Q1 2018 Update from the board of directors

Financial performance Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its subsidiaries, hereafter "the Group", closed a quarter showing increased revenues as a result of accelerated volumes. While the Group is still experiencing some market driven price pressure, the extent has lessened from previous quarters. In addition, on 31 January 2018, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Transoil Laboratory Ltd based in Manchester, United Kingdom leading to additional revenues in Q1 2018 for USD 0.3 million. As a result, revenues increased to USD 12,275 thousand in Q1 2018 in comparison to USD 11,647 thousand in Q1 2017.

The Group closed Q1 2018 with a net profit of USD 152 thousand (Q1 2017: net loss of USD 74 thousand). The operating cash flow in YTD Q1 2018 was USD 1,060 thousand negative, versus a negative cash flow of USD 2,324 YTD Q1 2017.
Organizational changes On 31 January 2018, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Transoil Laboratory Ltd based in Manchester, United Kingdom. There are no other significant organizational changes to report in Q1 2018.

Furthermore, the cost control measures continue to show effect in Q1 2018 in comparison to Q1 2017, although partly offset by exchange rate results.

Malcolm Cooper Managing Director VPS Group

The Group's Q1 EBITDA increased to USD 3,422 thousand in comparison to prior year (Q1 2017: USD 3,009 thousand) and the Group's Q1 Operating profit increased to USD 1,700 thousand in comparison to prior year (Q1 2017: USD 1,322 thousand).

Explanatory notes to condensed consolidated interim financial statements

5. Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the same as those applied in the Group's consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017. The following new or amended standards, which became effective in 2018, do not have a significant impact on the Group's financial performance or disclosure:
· Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRS standards
· Introduction of IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" and IFRS 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers"
The Group is assessing the potential impact on its financial performance or disclosure resulting from the future application of IFRS 16. The impact of IFRS 16 (effective from financial year 2019) on the balance sheet and the income statement will be disclosed in more detail in the annual report of financial year 2018. The current expectation is that the EBITDA will be positively impacted and the annual result will be remain unchanged.

6. Operating segments
The Group considers its activities as one segment in relation to the disclosure requirements of IFRS 8 Segment reporting.
7. Tax Expense
Tax expense is recognised based on management's best estimate of the weighted-average annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year multiplied by the pre-tax income of the interim reporting period. The Group's consolidated average tax rate is in respect of continuing operations for the three months ended 31 March 2018 22% (three months ended 31 March 2017: 22%).
8. Loan Covenants
The Group needs to be compliant with the stipulations in the loan covenant requirements of the bond agreement. As per 31 March 2018 the Group meets the requirements of the loan covenant as stipulated in the bond agreement.

9. Net finance costs
The change in net finance costs during financial year 2018 in comparison to financial year 2017 is mainly caused by the borrowing structure of the Group and financial year closing adjustments. The increased net finance costs is caused by the increased interest for the shareholder loan and an increase in the other financial expenses in Q1 2018 in comparison to Q1 2017 with regards to the amortisation of the finance expenses regarding the bond amendment in 2017 and foreign currency exchange effects.

The net finance costs of the Group is as follows.
