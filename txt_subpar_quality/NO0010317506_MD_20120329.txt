Partial conversion into a convertible bond Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of bonds (the "Bonds") in the above-captioned loans (the "Loans") where Norse Energy Corp. ASA ("NEC") is the Borrower. On 9 March 2012 a Bondholders' meeting was held pursuant to summons of 28 February 2012 (the "Bondholders' Meeting") regarding a restructuring proposal. The proposed restructuring was adopted by the Bondholders' Meeting which include inter alia a partial conversion of the Loans into a new convertible bond (the "Convertible Bond"). 40.59455 % of the principal amount of each Loan will be converted into the Convertible Bond at par without accrued interest (the "Conversion"). In addition to the Conversion, NEC will offer bonds in the Convertible Bond in a private placement (the "Private Placement"). Each Bondholder may choose to offer the Convertible Bonds, received from the Conversion, for sale in connection with the Private Placement. Bondholders who want to offer their Convertible Bonds for sale, in connection with the Private Placement, should notify Pareto or Carnegie as soon as possible. The right to sell Convertible Bonds in connection with the Private Placement is according to the ranking approved by the Bondholders' Meeting (the "Ranking"). In order to facilitate for the bondholders option to sell their Convertible Bonds, in connection with the Private Placement, according to the Ranking, the Convertible Bonds will initially have three tranches with separate ISINs. These tranches will, subsequent to the Private Placement, be cascaded into one ISIN
