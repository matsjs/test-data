To the bondholders in:

ISIN NO 001 070337.4 -

Metro Exploration Holding Corp. Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2014/2016

Oslo, 8 February 2016

Extension of Maturity Date
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") is appointed as bond trustee for the bond issue with ISIN NO 001 070337.4 (the "Bonds") issued by Metro Exploration Holding Corp. (the "Issuer" or "Metro Ex") pursuant to the terms of the bond agreement (the "Bond Agreement") dated 13 February 2014 between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee.
According to the Bond Agreement, the Maturity Date for the Bonds is 15 February 2016. As it is expected that further payments will be made to the Bondholders in the period following the Maturity Date, the maturity date in VPS will for purely practical reasons be extended by 1 year to 15 February 2017 (the "Technical Maturity Date"). In addition to facilitate future payments to the Bondholders, the technical extension of the maturity date will make trading and transactions connected to the Bonds easier. The Maturity Date of 15 February 2016 is still the contractual maturity date - i.e. the date on which the amounts under the Bonds formally become due and payable. Bonds may be redeemed before the Technical Maturity Date.
Information regarding future payments will be given in due course.

Kind regards Nordic Trustee ASA
