The North Alliance AS - Q1 2016 Interim report

Introduction
The North Alliance AS (NOA) is a group of companies offering services within marketing communication, design and technology. The family of companies operates in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, and Singapore.

The group was founded on January 23, 2014 when NOA acquired the following companies:

- Making Waves Group (NO, SE and PL) - Åkestam Holst Group
o Åkestam Holst (SE) o Bold (SE, DK) o StudioNOC (SE) o Promenad (SE) - Great Works (SE, DK) - AndCo (DK)

Design & Technology
Advertising Design Brand Experience Action Marketing and CRM Digital communication Advertising

In addition, Anorak (NO, Advertising) was acquired in October 2014 and in January 2015 NOA established the advertising company Acoustic in Singapore, a digital centric company that will work in the cross section between communication and technology.

In January 2016 NOA acquired the Swedish/American technology and communication company Nansen. Nansen has over 100 employees in Stockholm, Chicago and New York. The acquisition of Nansen will strengthen the Groups digital offering in the Swedish market and will together with Making Waves become a strong entity in the Nordics.

Financials
Total YTD net revenues as of March 31 2016 were 182.9 MNOK, up 43% from 2015. The growth in revenues comes largely from the acquisition of Nansen representing NOK 35m of the total net revenues for Q1. Excluding Nansen the organic growth in net revenues were 19.8 MNOK equal to 15.4%.

The EBITDA for Q1 came in at 10.5 MNOK, compared to 1 MNOK for Q1 2015. Nansen represents 4.4 MNOK of the Q1 EBITDA. Reported EBITDA includes 2.8 MNOK in non-recurring cost, mainly related to the Nansen transaction. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2016 is 13.3 MNOK.

On December 20, 2013 NOA entered into a Bond Agreement. The Bond issue was subsequently listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. NOA undertakes to comply with the certain financial covenants during the term of the Bond issue, and after Q1 2016 the company is in compliance with all such covenants.

Outlook
We expect the positive development to continue. The focus is now to utilize the NOA's Nordic digital capabilities as efficient as possible and be ready for further growth across the region.

Note 4 Estimates, judgments and assumptions
The preparation of interim financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In preparing these condensed interim financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 and condensed interim financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2015.

Total 182.889 143.796 28.553 10.540

Note 6 Seasonality
Historically we have seen a higher activity level in Q3 and Q4 compared to Q1 and Q2. The main factors explaining this are the higher number of marketing campaigns that typically are run by our clients in Q3 and Q4, and the fact that Q3 and Q4 in total have more hours available for client deliveries.

Note 7 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares purchased by the company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
