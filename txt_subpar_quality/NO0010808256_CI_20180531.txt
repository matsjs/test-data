Letter from the CEO

The underlying growth for Melin Group continues to be healthy as a result of solid operational performance throughout the first quarter, resulting in an organic year-on-year growth of 19.1 percent, supported by continued stable market conditions.

The integration of Odin Kapital has been a success and we therefore retain our growth forecast for the group. Two other milestones in Q1 2018 were the acquisitions of CrediCare and Gordion, underpinning our ambitions for growth and international expansion.

CrediCare is an established provider of payment solutions and administration systems in the Norwegian market. The acquisition gives us access to segments we are not present in today, including fitness centres and veterinary offices. Additionally, both the CrediCare and Odin Kapital acquisitions further strengthen Melin Medical's position within the healthcare industry. Closing of the CrediCare transaction was initially planned for March, but is now expected by the end of Q2. Melin Medical has a significant pipeline of Norwegian dental practices ready to install CrediCare's system as soon as the acquisition is closed.
The acquisition of Gordion makes Melin Group the #1 provider of self-service payment solutions and administration systems to the Swedish healthcare industry, providing us with a significantly larger platform to grow from in the Swedish market. The company's solutions include patient administration terminals for health clinics, gift card terminals for stores and shopping malls, terminals for car rental, check-in and payment terminals for ferry lines, plus more. This acquisition was closed in February.

The combined strengths of our recent acquisitions enable us to build new and improved systems that make us a more cost effective company and an even more reliable supplier to our customers. The acquisitions also underline our strategy of branching out into new industry verticals and establishing a leading position at the physical point-of-sales channel, where self-service payment solutions and administrative systems can replace less cost-efficient ways of solving the needs of the end-user.

Consolidated pro forma revenues, including Odin Kapital, Gordion and CrediCare, grew with 39.0 percent to NOK 100.9 million compared to the corresponding quarter last year (NOK 72.6 million, adjusted for accrued revenue of NOK 11.9 million). The Q1 revenues could have been higher had we not chosen to postpone some of the Odin Kapital customer migration to the Easter period. However, in order to provide good customer service and keep operational disturbances to an absolute minimum, we chose to migrate over the

Easter period which is traditionally very quiet for health clinics. This move was well received by our customers. As a result, our churn rate remained low in the quarter, while some revenues were postponed to Q2.
The EBITDA result ended at NOK 47.2 million in Q1 2018, an increase from NOK 39.1 million in Q1 2017. We did not see full effect from Melin Collectors in Q1, but Q2 looks stronger. The lower than expected EBITDA contribution from Melin Collectors was primarily caused by optimisation work of the value chain from the payment terminals through to final payment received. This has affected Melin Collectors' operational performance in Q1, but will yield positive returns from Q2 onwards.

Note 2--Accounting principles
This interim report has been prepared in accordance with Norske regnskapsstandarder (NGAAP). The accounting principles applied are the same as those applied in the latest annual reports of Melin Medical and Melin Collectors unless otherwise stated below. This report has not been subject to review by the Melin Group's auditor. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with NGAAP requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to make certain judgments in applying the group's accounting policies.

Note 3--Accrued revenue
Up until Q2 2017, Melin Group recognized revenue from invoice fee, reminder fee and debt collection fee at the time when the fee/claim was settled and paid. After gaining more experience and collecting empirical data regarding resolution rates and expected revenue from different patient segments, Melin Medical AS and Melin Collectors AS in Q3 2017 adopted the accrued revenue principle, where recognition of invoice fee, reminder fee and debt collection fee is based on the expected revenues and resolution rates for the active claims / portfolio of claims. This principle for accrued revenue is in line with the principle applied by similar debt collection companies in the Nordic market.
By applying the accrued revenue principle from Q3 2017 onwards, Melin Group had one-off effects in the profit and loss statement for 2017 (equaling the accumulated accrued revenue as of 31 December 2016). One off effects described above amounted to MNOK 47.6 in revenue, MNOK -2.9 in cost of materials and MNOK 44.7 in EBITDA.
As per 31 March 2018 the total effect on accrued revenue was MNOK 78.4, the cost of materials was MNOK -7.6 and the EBITDA was MNOK 70.8.

Note 4--Consolidated financial statements
Please note that as Odin Kapital AS (acquired 3 November 2017) and Gordion AB (acquired 6 February 2018), and have been integrated into the Melin Group accounts from these dates in line with NGAAP standards. Also note that at the 30 June 2017, a demerger was carried out in Helseinnovasjon AS, where the shares in the subsidiary PatientSky AS was transferred to Helseinnovasjon II AS. Thus, in the consolidated financial statements presented here, PatientSky AS has been treated as an investment in associated companies (i.e. not included in the consolidated Melin Group figures).
As a consequence, the consolidated profit and loss, balance sheet and cash flow statements as of 31 March 2017 as presented in this interim report, do not reconcile back to the reported historical financial statements for the Melin Group.
