UPDATE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED 31 MARCH 2017
During the first quarter of 2017, the Company continued to provide IT housing solutions to its sole customer, EVRY.
The Company also assisted EVRY to undertake a second phase of additional construction and project management work. This construction work commenced in the first quarter of 2017, and is expected to be finalised in the second quarter of 2017.
For the quarter ended 31 March 2017, the Company's operating revenues totalled NOK 37.7 million, which is almost two and a half times higher than the operating revenue of NOK 15.8 million reported in the same quarter last year. Whilst part of the increase was due to receiving a full quarter's revenue; the majority of the increase, approximately NOK 16.8 million, relates to the added value services provided for the construction project mentioned above.
Operating expenses totalled NOK 21.6 million, which comprised of NOK 21.0 million of cost of goods sold, operational and management support costs; and NOK 0.6 million of personnel costs. The increase in operating expenses of NOK 14.2 million compared to the same quarter last year is due to the costs of providing the added value services, as described above, of approximately NOK 14.9 million offset by a net decrease of NOK 0.7 million in other operating expenses.
EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortisation) for the quarter was NOK 16.1 million, almost doubling the EBITDA reported in the same quarter last year.
A charge of NOK 8.4 million was made to reflect depreciation of the plant and equipment, and the Company incurred net finance costs of circa NOK 6.6 million, compared to NOK 8.8 million and NOK 6.3 million respectively in the same quarter last year.
In light of the above, the profit before income tax for the quarter came in at NOK 1.0 million, compared to a loss before income tax of NOK 6.6 million in the same quarter last year.
Cash generated from operations was NOK 5.8 million, compared to NOK 6.8 million in the same quarter last year.
Borrowings totalled NOK 495.5 million as at 31 March 2017, which reflects the Bond Issue completed in June 2014, which largely remains unchanged from the same quarter last year. There were no movements in shareholder loans in the first quarter of 2017 with the balance remaining at NOK 269.1 million.
As at 31 March 2017, cash and cash equivalents stood at NOK 32.8 million compared to NOK 33.7 million at the end of the first quarter in 2016.
