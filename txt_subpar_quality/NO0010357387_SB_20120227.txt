Summons to Bondholders' Meeting - Amendment of Bond Loan Agreements
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM" or the "Loan Trustee") acts as loan trustee for the two bond loans with ISIN NO 001 035738.7 and ISIN NO 001 037520.7 (together the "Bonds" or the "Residual Loans"). Nexus Floating Production Ltd. (together referred to as the "Company", or "Nexus") is the "Borrower" under the Residual Loans. Nexus Floating Production Ltd and its (direct and indirect) subsidiaries are defined as "Group."
All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the respective agreements for the Residual Loans, as amended and restated from time to time (the "Loan Agreements").
The information regarding the operational and financial status o f the Company and market conditions is provided by the Company, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.

Background
Please refer to the summons to bondholders' meeting dated 22 December 2011 for a bondholders' meeting on 30 December 2011 (the "Previous Summons").
The proposal contemplated by the Previous Summons for terminating the Loan Agreements and replacing these with a Conditional Payment Agreement (as defined in the Previous Summons) was not approved in the bondholders' meeting held on 30 December 2011. Accordingly, the two Loan Agreements remained unchanged and will mature on 7 March 2012.
The Company acknowledges the Bondholders' position with respect to the proposal put forward in the Previous Summons. However, due to the nature of the ongoing discussions referred to below, the Company now wishes to propose a short extension o f the maturity date under each of the Loan Agreements. The new proposed maturity date for the Residual Loans is 9 April 2012.
