Completion

e® N O R S K T IL L IT S M A N N ASA

Completion as defined in the Summons is expected to take place on Friday 11 December 2009 or on one of the following days soon thereafter. A separate announcement will be made on www.stamdata.no when the date of Completion is finally set. The Trustee regard that there are no reason for the Completion not to take place, as the remaining obstacles are of practical matter and there is proven will on both sides to deal with the practical issues remaining.

Trade is blocked

From and including Tuesday 8 December 2009 the bonds in all the Loans are blocked for trades in VPS (the Securities Depository). This is to avoid any confusion in the relative complex closing procedure.

Record Date

Thursday 10 December 2009 (end of business) will be the record date for the Completion. Hence, bondholders registered in VPS at that time will be the ones rightful to receive the New Bonds and shares as the case might be.

Interest payment on the 2005 Bond and the 2009 Bond

The parts of the 2004 Bond, 2005 Bond, 2009 Bond and the Intex Loan that is not converted into shares will be rolled into the New Bond. This includes the Principal not converted and the accrued interest.

For the 2005 Bond and the 2009 Bond, which has interest payment originally due on 1 December 2009, the New Bonds paid as interest will be allocated the bondholders registered as bondholders at 16 November 2009 (end of business) (prior to the Bonds X-coupon date).

Yours sincerely Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
