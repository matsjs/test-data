Please note that the below timeline is subject to completion of the Private Placement taking place on 28 February 2018. If completion of the Private Placement takes place at a later date, the timeline will be adjusted accordingly based on when completion takes place.
Step 1 - 28 February (T-1): The Effective Date for the amendment and restatement agreements governing the Bond Issues and dated 21 February 2018 (the "Amended Bond Agreements").
