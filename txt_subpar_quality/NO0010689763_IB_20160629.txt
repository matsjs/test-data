CHAIRMAN'S REPORT

This Chairman's Report is made by Chad Griffin, a licensed insolvency practitioner of FTI Consulting LLP, 200 Aldersgate, Aldersgate Street, London, EC1A 4HD (the Chairm an) pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Insolvency Act 1986 (the Act) and Rule 1.17 of the Insolvency (Scotland) Rules 1986 (the Rules). This report notes the results of the Company creditors' meeting and Company member's meeting.

Company Creditors' Meeting

1.

A meeting of the Company's creditors was duly convened pursuant to section 3 of the Act and

held at 1lam on Friday 17 June 2016 at Palm Court Hotel, 81 Seafield Road, Aberdeen, AB15

2.

A full list of creditors attending or represented at the meeting is listed at Appendix 1, along with

the amount claimed by each creditor and the amount of each creditor's claim admitted by the

The Chairman noted that Lisa Jane Rickelton and Chad Griffin, both licenced insolvency

practitioners of FTI Consulting LLP, 200 Aldersgate, Aldersgate Street, London, EC1A 4HD

were appointed administrators of the Company on 6 January 2016. The primary objective of the

administration was to rescue the Company as a going concern, by way of a sale of the

Company's shares, facilitated by a Company Voluntary Arrangement (the CVA).

4.

The Chairman noted that no prospective purchaser was willing to buy the shares of the

Company without first implementing a CVA of the Company because of the Company's

outstanding debts and the fact that the Company is in administration. Given the lack of returns

for unsecured creditors of the Company by any other means, the CVA represented the best

option for the Company's unsecured creditors.

The Chairman noted that Lisa Jane Rickelton and Chad Griffin (the Nominees) proposed a

CVA for the Company dated 1 June 2016 under Part 1 of the Act. A copy of the CVA proposal

was made available to all known creditors of the Company before the meeting.

6.

The EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings will apply to the CVA. The CVA will be main

proceedings as defined in Article 3 of the EC Regulation as the Company has its registered

office in Scotland and the Company's centre of main interests is Scotland in the United

Kingdom.

7.

The Chairman asked the meeting if there were any questions. A number of questions were asked

by creditors and were answered by the Chairman.

8.

The CVA proposal was approved with no modifications, with 100% of the votes cast in favour

of the CVA.
