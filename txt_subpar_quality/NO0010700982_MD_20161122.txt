Quarterly Report
Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains forward-looking statements that relate to future events, including our future operating results and conditions, our prospects and our future financial performance and condition, all of which are largely based on our current expectations and projections. Known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. It is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the potential impact of these factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statement. These factors include, but are not limited to, (i) the downturn in oil markets and increased competition among offshore drillers, (ii) availability of capital and credit market volatility, (iii) local and global economic conditions, (iv) our anticipated growth strategies, (v) political, economic and financial pressures that impact our sole customer, PEMEX, and (vi) our future business development, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, our business model is highly leveraged, we have only one customer, PEMEX, and we operate in a highly competitive market, so new risk factors may emerge from time to time. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by words or phrases such as "may", "will", "expect", "anticipate", "target", "aim", "estimate", "intend", "plan", "believe", "potential", "continue", "is/are likely to" or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements made in this report relate only to events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in this report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should read this report with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect.

Quarterly Overview
(Units in US$j
Company Highlights
Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro S.A.P.I. de C.V. (referred to as "Oro Negro," "Company," "we" or "us" herein) reports revenues of US$75.7M during the third quarter of 2016, higher than the US$52.5M reported during the second quarter of 2016. This increase in revenues was generated by the accrued dayrate revenue from June to September, with the entire amounted reflected in the month of September. The amount is based upon the dayrate returning to its original contract amount, US$160k. Of the total amount of revenues, approximately US$43.3M will be reversed in the following quarter once the dayrate is adjusted to a new contract amount of $116.3K as of June 2016, as agreed with PEMEX.
Like every business in our industry, Oro Negro is facing significant challenges as a result of the downturn in oil markets. Additionally, we are dependent on the performance of our only customer, PEMEX, which has been adversely affected by these industry-wide challenges. We continue to partner with PEMEX to address the collective issues we face, but these challenges directly and negatively impacted our liquidity, which remains extremely limited. As a result, the Company must continue to make difficult choices on the timing for paying its obligations, while simultaneously ensuring that our rigs are operating safely and consistent with the expectations of PEMEX. Furthermore, the Company was not able to pay the outstanding principal and accrued interest in respect of its First Priority 7.5% Senior Secured Bond Issue 2014/2019 (the "2019 bonds"), which amounts were due on October 24, 2016, due to the difficult situation the industry is undergoing. The Company was able to obtain waivers from bondholders and on November 9, 2016 amended the bond agreement governing the 2019 bonds to allow the Company interim access to restricted cash accounts in order to continue operations while it develops a long-term capitalization plan.
Despite recent financial difficulties, the Company continued to successfully execute on its operational strategy during the third quarter. Oro Negro's fleet achieved another quarter with high uptime levels, recording an average uptime of 99.2% during the third quarter of 2016. Fortius ended the third quarter with an uptime of 100.0%, offering the best performance of Oro Negro's fleet, followed by Impetus, Laurus, Primus and Decus with average uptimes of 99.8%, 99.6%, 99.3% and 97.5% respectively.
Operational Results
As of September 30, 2016, our fleet consists of five premium jack-ups and one modular rig, providing enough scale to generate substantial operating synergies, with five of our rigs under contract with PEMEX.
Oro Negro is committed to maintaining the highest safety and environmental responsibility standards. We operate a Quality Management System (QMS) with principles founded in our ZERO HARM policies; which are based upon causing zero harm to people, environment, and equipment. No major incidents were reported during the third quarter of 2016.
