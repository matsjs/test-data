agreements in connection with documenting the decisions made by the Bondholders' meeting as well as to carry out the necessary completion work, including making amendments to the Loan Agreement.

4. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL
4.1 THE BORROWER'S EVALUATION
The Company is in need of a financial restructuring as the current cash generation is insufficient to meet the contracted repayment of the Loan and the Junior Bank Debt amortisation schedule and short term liquidity is limited. The Company has worked intensively over the last 18 months with both the Syndicate Banks and a group of Bondholders, and is of the opinion that long-term financial stability can best be addressed within the wider scope of the planned Restructuring, with the main objective to safeguard values for all stakeholders.
The Company acknowledges that significant concessions are required from all stakeholders, however firmly believes that the Restructuring represents a balanced proposal that will improve liquidity headroom and safeguard values for the Bondholders in the current continued challenging shipping market. Consequently, the Borrower is respectfully asking the Bondholders to approve the Proposal.
The Borrower has informed the Loan Trustee, that Bondholders representing approximately 46% of the Loan have reviewed the Proposal and are positive thereto and inclined to vote in favour of the Proposal.
4.2 THE BOND TRUSTEE'S DISCLAIMER/NON-RELIANCE
Nothing herein shall constitute a recommendation to the Bondholders by the Bond Trustee. Bondholders should independently evaluate the Proposal and vote accordingly.
5. INVITATION TO AN INFORMATION MEETING
In order to provide Bondholders with an update on operational and financial aspects of the Company, as well as an update on the Restructuring process, all Bondholders are cordially invited to participate in an information meeting on 16 February 2011 at 11:30 CET at the premises of ABG Sundal Collier, Munkedamsveien 45E, 7th floor, Oslo, Norway.

EXHIBIT 1 - BACKGROUND & COMPANY UPDATE
To the bondholders in:
FRN Primorsk International Shipping Limited Unsecured Open Callable Bond Issue 2007/2011 with ISIN NO 001 05418.6 (NOK Tranche) and NO 001 035420.2 (USD Tranche)
Oslo, 9 February 2011
In addition to this Exhibit 1, the Company has also provided a separate presentation which is intended to give an update on the Company's operational and financial status, and the ongoing Restructuring, which is enclosed as Exhibit 2 to the Summons to Bondholders' Meeting (the "Summons"). Bondholders are encouraged to read both Exhibit 1 and 2, and the Summons. All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein and/or in Exhibit 2 and/or the Summons hereto shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the agreement for the Loan dated 23 February 2007 (the "Loan Agreement").
Primorsk International Shipping Limited is a world leading owner and operator of ice class tankers. The fleet comprises a total o f 23 vessels or 1.95 million dwt, with an average age o f approximately 3.4 years. The Company is a private company limited by shares incorporated and domiciled in Cyprus. Following a restructuring of the Company's parent group in 2006, the Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Maritime Prospect Trust Fiduciary Assets, Holdings Sari ("MPT Sari"), incorporated in Luxembourg. The entire share capital of MPT Sari is held by an independent fiduciary on behalf of Maritime Prospect Trust. The beneficiaries of MPT Sari are the existing shareholders and ultimate beneficial shareholders o f the shares in Primorsk Shipping Corporation A/O ("PSC"), a company incorporated in the Russian Federation, which was previously the ultimate holding company before the restructuring.
Since the Company issued the Loan in February 2007, it has taken delivery of 16 vessels and raised over USD 1 billion in senior bank debt. On the back of a troubled tanker and bulk market, the Borrower suffered some losses on their newbuilding program in 2008 and 2009.
In September 2007 the Company ordered an additional two suezmax tankers from Hyundai Heavy Industries.
In May 2008, the Company ordered two supramax bulkers at STX, as April/May 2009 delivery re-sales (delivered in September 2009). The Company does not intend to take delivery of any other vessels for the foreseeable future.
Declining values combined with a cancellation of one significant charter contract and increased margins on the secured bank facilities lead to a severe reduction in the Company's book equity as o f year end 2009 and added pressure on the Company's liquidity profile.

As noted in the Company's 2009 audited financial accounts, the Company is in breach o f the Book Equity Ratio covenant (the "Covenant Breach") per fiscal year end 2009. The Bond Trustee was informed about the Covenant Breach and the ongoing senior secured bank debt restructuring prior to receiving the 2009 audited financial accounts. Subsequently, on 31 May 2010, the Borrower entered into an open ended Book Equity Ratio covenant waiver (the "Waiver") with certain bondholders representing approximately 46% of the Loan. The Waiver can be terminated on two business days notice and was among others put in place to facilitate continued progress in the bank restructuring. The Bond Trustee then entered into the same Waiver on behalf of the other Bondholders.
In addition, the Borrower was in breach of the Tangible Net Worth covenant for all four of the core senior secured bank facilities based on 30 June 2009 numbers, reported in October 2009. A waiver was negotiated with all senior banks. Moreover, the Company breached certain value maintenance and minimum cash covenants. Waivers were also obtained for these breaches, however there are no waivers in place at present. The Borrower and its syndicate banks (the "Syndicate Banks") have worked intensively over the last 18 months to restructure the Bank Loans. The Bank Loans include four facilities with 13 Syndicate Banks, totalling approx. USD 775 million as of 31 December 2010. These facilities are secured by substantially all of the Group's assets.
Based on the above, it is evident that the Borrower is in need o f financial restructuring. The current liquidity position is lower than covenant levels however the Company is able to fully service the senior ranking debt within the Bank Loans, however the junior ranking debt within the Bank Loans ("Junior Bank Debt") such as the interest rate swaps and revolving facility in the $530m Bank Loan will undergo significant restructuring in order to stabilize the Company and consequently a restructuring o f the Loan, as described in this document, is a key part of the overall restructuring. The Borrower is confident that with the proposed restructuring in place the Company will have the ability to focus on its core business - being a world leading owner and operator o f ice class tankers.
The approval from the Syndicate Banks to the Company's proposed restructuring plan, that is focused on creating a more robust financial platform, which together with the Company's modem fleet and good operational track-record, should form a good basis for safe guarding its creditors, will be mutually dependent on an acceptable restructuring o f the Loan.
Yours sincerely, J

PRIMORSK INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING LIMITED

Executive summary

- Primorsk International Shipping Limited ("Primorsk" or the "Company") is a world leading owner and operator of ice class tankers
- The combination of an extensive newbuilding program and a troubled tanker and bulk market lead the Company into financial problems in 2009 triggering breach of several financial covenants both in the Bond Loan and the Bank Loans
- Primorsk initiated talks with their syndicate banks in 2H 2009, however a complex bank syndicate comprising of senior and junior bank debt with 13 syndicate banks and four bank facilities have delayed the process considerably
- Throughout this period Primorsk has been in dialogue with Bondholders representing around 50% of the Bond Loan and Norsk Tillitsmann
- In September 2010 Primorsk initiated the sale of five vessels, however a falling shipping market made the potential sales unattractive for the Company's stakeholders for both equity and debt
- In December 2010 the Company entered into confidential talks with buyers about the disposal of six vessels employed in the Sakhalin I and II shuttle tanker business. A final agreement has now been signed with the buyers and Primorsk is in final discussions with the syndicate banks on restructuring of the secured bank indebtedness.

Progress Report - Summary of Recent Activity
- In December 2010 the Company took the view that in order to remedy its financial problems radical action was required. Consequently discussions were opened with the eventual buyers, to seek their interest in the Sakhalin I and II Shuttle Tanker businesses that have been developed by the Company
- The Company has reached an agreement to sell six shuttle tankers.
- It is the Company's intention to use the net sales proceeds to prepay bank debt and to restructure the remaining bank debt, swaps and bond in such a way as to stabilise the cash flow and deleverage the Company to acceptable levels
- The Company has taken a pragmatic approach to the proposed Financial Plan, taking the view that the plan needs to be meet four key principles:
- The Financial Plan must be robust enough to provide adequate safeguards against depressed market conditions
- A high level of liquidity should be maintained within the Company in the interests of all stakeholders
- The Financial Plan should provide an appropriate and proportional level of comfort to all of the Company's creditors
- As little change as possible to existing arrangements
- Key common goal must be the long term viability of the Company

Slide 14

PRIMORSK INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING LIMITED

Introduction to Financial Plan
