Quarterly interim report Q1 2016

World Wide Supply
The quarter in brief
Four Vessels are laid up and two vessels are on contract with Petrobras in Brazil. In 2016 the management agreement with Sydvestor AS was terminated with effect from January 31. Many of their management functions were taken on by Remøy Management AS. World Wide Supply Group's net operating income for the first quarter was NOK 36,3 million. The EBITDA in the 1st quarter was NOK 8,8 million and EBIT was NOK 7,8 million after deduction of NOK 1,1 million in depreciation. Net financial income were NOK 21,7 million (of which NOK 51,9 million was net unrealized agio) resulting in a pre-tax profit of NOK 29,5 million. The Company is in breach of its obligations under the loanagreement. The lenders have, in spite of the default, asked the board and management to continue the operations of the Company and not file for bankruptcy. In this respect an agreement has been entered into reflected in the chapter on financial risk. As a result of the Company being in breach of its loan agreements the Company cannot report financially as a going concern.
Operations Average utilization of the fleet was 32,5 % for the 1st quarter. Two vessels are on four years contract with Petrobras in Brazil until June 2018, based on yearly renewal of the CAA (Certificate of Charter Authorization) and AIT (Registration Certificate of temporary foreign Vessel).The two vessels have their certificates up for renewal on June 21 and August 10 respectively. The contracts have already been blocked by Brazilian companies. If the blocking is not lifted within the date of expiration the charter parties will be terminated. There is a possibility that Petrobras can apply to the Brazilian National Waterway Transportation Agency (ANTAQ) for a 60 day extension of the certificates even though the vessels are blocked. Four vessels are laid-up.
Profit and loss 1.1. - 31.03.2016 (1.1. - 31.03.2015)________________________________________________ Operating income was equivalent to NOK 38,4 (88,2) million in Q1 2016 while operating expenses were NOK 27,5 (59,7) million.

Balance sheet per 31.03.2016 (per 31.12.2015) Total assets were NOK 559,8 (549,0) million. Tangible fixed assets amounted to NOK 459,1 (460,7) million. According to the impairment test the average value per vessel were USD 10 million. The group's current assets were NOK 86,6 (76,5) million of which cash equivalents corresponded to NOK 23,6 (32,9) million. Book equity as per 31.03.2016 was NOK -816,2 (-882,2) million based on conversion of EUR to NOK at rates on delivery dates for the vessels. At the balance sheet date of 31.03.2015 the Group had long term interest bearing debt in the amount of USD 150 million. The working capital was NOK -1 215,8 million at 31.03.2016 compared to NOK -1 274,4 million at 31.12.2015.
Market outlook The Company is facing a long period of depressed market rates. On a global basis approx. 500 OSV are in lay-up and approx. 100 OsVs are in lay up in the North Sea. Investment budgets for the oil companies are still being reduced contracting the demand for oil service assets. The board does not expect any consistent market improvement for several years.
Financial risk The major financial risk confronting the Company is that it is in breach of its obligations under the loan agreement. Interest has not been paid since August 2015. This default has not been waived by the lenders but they have agreed to leave interest falling due as unpaid until further notice. Since the Company is constantly taking on new debt in form of new trade creditors, the lenders have agreed to allow the company the use of its cash to pay these, even in the case of an enforcement of the securities.
Employees The Group had at the end of first quarter 37 employees of which 34 sailors including hired personnel.
