Restructuring - Payment and amended Loan Agreement
On 11 November 2009 a Bondholders' meeting was held which adopted a restructuring proposal including the sale of the Nexus 1 FPSO, a repayment, and an amendment of the Loan Agreement.
The closing procedures in relation to the sale of the Nexus 1 FPSO was completed during the latest week-end.
Payment
The payment procedures have been initialized, and the USD 87,500,000 payment date will be 20 November 2009.
Amendment of the Loan Agreement
The Loan Agreement has been amended to reflect the restructuring, including among other things;
· the change of debtor to Nexus Floating Production Ltd, · a split of the bonds. Due to practical reasons the Loan Trustee has made a decision to
denominate the Bonds at USD 1, and · the Residual Claim of USD 37,956,000 - equal to USD 21,689 per bond prior to the
split. Hence, the Residual Claim equals 21,689 new bonds per old bond.
