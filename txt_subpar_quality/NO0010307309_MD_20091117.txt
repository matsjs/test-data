C orrection to the Sum m ons to B on d h old ers' M eetings - R estru ctu rin g Proposal
Reference is made to the Summons to Bondholders' meeting dated 13 November 2009 (the "Summons") in the above mentioned Loans. In the first paragraph of 4.1 in the Summons - "The Borrowers' evaluation" one line unfortunately was missed out. The correct wording of the first paragraph in 4.1 shall be:
4.1 The Borrower's evaluation
The Borrower continuously evaluates its cash-flow and the ability to meet its obligations as they become due. As a result of delays in moving towards full production capacity at the LEFA gold mine in Guinea arising from the poor condition of the plant and the mining equipment and political instability in Guinea, among other things, the Board of Directors of the Borrower determined it to be in the best interests of the Borrower to attempt to reduce the Borrower's financial leverage. As a result, the Borrower initiated discussions with certain of the principal Bondholders to explore opportunities for a restructuring of the Borrower's debt. Based on feedback from the Arranger and the Borrower's largest shareholder, it became evident to the Board of Directors that raising any new equity would be conditional upon a substantial restructuring of the Loans. The Borrower announced a proposed restructuring in August 2009 which included a conversion into the Borrower's common shares of approximately USD 148 million principal amount of the Loans and a rights offering, pursuant to which the Borrower proposed to issue subscription rights to holders of common shares to purchase up to 90 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of NOK 90 million. This proposal was approved by the holders of the 2005 Bonds, 2009 Bonds, and the 2006 Bonds, but was rejected by the holders of the 2004 Bonds at a meeting held on September 1, 2009.
Yours Sincerely, Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
