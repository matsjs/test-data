· The Company has run up an uncovered financing need in the amount of approximately EUR 30 million, which has arisen as a consequence of operating losses and delayed delivery of a vessel under construction.
· Due to the high leverage o f the Company a normal equity issue to cover the capital need was not a viable alternative.
· The Company has sold its shares in one o f its ship owning subsidiaries, North Ocean 103 KS, in order to cover part of its need for financing, cf. above, and has as a consequence relinquished considerable future revenues.
· The Company's reduced income potential, due to the sale o f the ship owning subsidiary and certain changes to its business profile, has necessitated a reduction of the Company's outstanding debt. The debt reduction shall be achieved through a write-down of the Loan and other interest bearing debt in the Company.
· It is a condition for the contemplated reduction o f the Company's debt, that the creditors, hereunder the Bondholders, shall hold a dominant position in the Company's ownership structure as long as the restructured debt, including, but not limited to the Loan, is outstanding.
As a consequence, there will be proposed changes to the Loan, including, but not limited to a conversion of 52.5 % o f the total outstanding amounts under the Loan pr 18 June 2009 into new shares in the Company. In addition, the Bondholders will, inter alia, be offered warrants in the Company.
Please see the restructuring Proposal for further information regarding the contemplated restructuring process.

4. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES
4.1 Oceanteam's evaluation o f the Proposal
Based on its current financial situation and the market outlook, Oceanteam is o f the opinion that the Proposal offered to the Bondholders is a fair and balanced solution and that the proposed amendments are beneficial to the Bondholders.
The Company's change o f strategy reduces earnings, but also reduces risk. The Company's new strategy involves a reasonable debt level on a going concern basis and provides the Company the ability to continue being a key participant in an exciting niche of the offshore construction market.

7

N O R SK TILLITSM A N N ASA www.rrustee.no
The communicated liquidity need, as assessed by the company, has been reduced through the sale o f North Ocean III KS, but this transaction has reduced its future earnings by a considerable amount.
The Company's weak financial position continues and the company needs to strengthen its equity through the proposed New Issue.
The Proposal provides the creditors with a majority shareholding position (61.9% ownership for the Bondholders) from the time of the restructuring and protects the creditors via the warrants issued. It also provides the key resources necessary to recover the values of the Company and shareholders willing to invest with an upside potential and a work out structure that should return a maximum effort of such resources and a healthy potential recovery for the Bondholders.

The Company has engaged First Securities AS (the "First") as its financial advisor with

respect to the Proposal. Bondholders may accordingly contact First Securities AS

for further information.

4.2 The Trustee's evaluation o f the Proposal

Taken into account today's challenging debt and equity markets, and the capital structure of the Company, asking for a partial conversion of the Loan and an extension of the final maturity date o f the Company's existing debt is the option used by most companies. Based on the information given from the Company and its advisors, refinancing o f the existing debt is not a valid option as the asset values of the Company does not warrant the amount of debt. The Bondholders must themselves evaluate whether the compensation for the proposed amendments is fair and balanced.

The Trustee is of the opinion that the Proposal is based on the most obvious solution for the Company taken into consideration that it reflects that the Company is in a position where it has to adapt to the challenging debt and equity markets.

It is recommended that the Bondholders consult with any own advisors to evaluate the consequences of the Proposal and with tax advisors as to the possible tax consequences o f the Proposal. All Bondholders must be aware that even if the Proposal is accepted, the Company still has challenges going forward.

Styret er ansvarlige for de verdsettelser som er gjort. Vår oppgave er å utarbeide redegjørelsen i forbindelse med generalforsamlingens beslutning om at obligasjonseieme i "FRN Oceanteam Power & Umbilical ASA Senior Unsecured Bond Issue 2007/2010" (ISIN: NO001 037324.4), Oceanteam Holding B.V., North Sea Shipping AS og Toha Invest B.V. skal kunne gjøre opp innskuddsforpliktelse for aksjer i Oceanteam ASA ved motregning, og avgi en uttalelse om at gjeldsposten som skal kunne motregnes, har en verdi som minst svarer til vederlaget.
Den videre redegjørelsen består av to deler. Den første delen beskriver gjeldsposten som skal kunne motregnes. Den andre delen er vår uttalelse om at gjeldsposten som skal kunne motregnes, har en verdi som minst svarer til vederlaget.
Opplysninger om gjelden
Gjelden som skal kunne motregnes består av følgende lån:
1) Obligasjonslån pålydende NOK 800 000 000: Inkludert påløpte ikke betalte renter t.o.m. 18.06.09 utgjør dette lånet en gjeld på kr 842 078 958, hvorav kr 442 078 958 skal motregnes som oppgjør for aksjeinnskudd.
2) Lån til Oceanteam Holding B. V. : Inkludert påløpte ikke betalte renter t.o.m. 18.06.09 utgjør dette lånet en gjeld på EUR 10 819 349, hvorav EUR 5 679 998 skal motregnes som oppgjør for aksjeinnskudd.
3) Lån til North Sea Shipping Holding AS: Inkludert påløpte ikke betalte renter t.o.m. 18.06.09 utgjør dette lånet en gjeld på EUR 1 322 825, hvorav EUR 694 463 skal motregnes som oppgjør for aksjeinnskudd.

Grunnlagfor vår uttalelse Vi har utført vår kontroll og avgir vår uttalelse i samsvar med standard for attestasjonsoppdrag SA 3802 "Revisors uttalelser og redegjørelser etter selskapslovgivningen". Standarden krever at vi planlegger og utfører kontroller for å oppnå betryggende sikkerhet for at gjelden som skal motregnes, minst svarer til det avtalte vederlaget. Arbeidet omfatter kontroll av at gjelden er en reell betalingsforpliktelse. Vår kontroll gir etter vår mening et forsvarlig grunnlag for vår uttalelse. Uttalelse Vi mener at den gjeld som skal kunne motregnes, minst svarer til det avtalte vederlaget i aksjer i Oceanteam ASA pålydende kr 5 305 494,30 samt overkurs kr 496 988 640,11.
