The information in this summons regarding the Issuer is provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
The Company has decided to amend the waiver proposal included in the summons to bondholders' meetings in the Bonds dated 24 June 2013 (the "Summons"), by increasing the proposed compensation fee described in section 2.2 of the Summons to 0.50%. All other terms and conditions of the Summons remain unchanged, and will, with the amendment described above, be considered on the bondholders' meeting to be held on 8 July 2013 at 13:30 hours (Oslo time).
The Issuer and its advisors have confirmed to the Trustee that the new proposal is supported by the largest bondholders in the Bond.
