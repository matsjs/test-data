To the bondholders in ISIN NO 001 039212.9 - 7.5 per cent Marine Subsea AS Senior Secured Callable Convertible Bond Issue 2007/2012
UPDATE ON TIMING OF COMPLETION
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("Loan Trustee") is appointed as trustee in the above mentioned bond with ISIN NO 001 039212.9 (the "Convertible Bond") issued by Marine Subsea AS (the "Borrower").
All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the 9 October Summons (as defined below).
As a result of a liquidity crisis, the Borrower proposed a restructuring of the Convertible Bond (the "Restructuring Plan"), as set out more fully in the bondholder summons dated 9 October 2009 (the "9 October Summons"). The bondholder resolutions approving the Restructuring Plan (the "Bondholder Resolutions") were passed at the joint bondholders' meeting held on 19 October 2009. The approval of the Convertible Bondholders was subject to all conditions precedent (as more particularly set out at paragraphs 3.3(vi) of the 9 October Summons) (the "Conditions Precedent") having been met or waived on or before 11 December 2009.
All parties, including the Borrower, the Loan Trustee on behalf of the Convertible Bondholders, the New Lenders and their respective advisors have been working hard towards the satisfaction of all Conditions Precedent before 11 December 2009. Although significant progress has been made, all Conditions Precedent will not be satisfied before this deadline.
Accordingly, the Loan Trustee hereby provides notice to the Convertible Bondholders that it has agreed to temporarily waive the 11 December 2009 deadline to allow completion to occur after this date. It is currently anticipated that completion will occur on 16 December 2009, although there is a possibility that this could be delayed until 23 December 2009.
Yours sincerely
I'foesk Tillitsmann
