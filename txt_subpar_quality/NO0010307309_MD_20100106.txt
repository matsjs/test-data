To the bondholders in:
ISIN NO 001 030730.9 (NOK) and ISIN NO 001 030731.7 (USD) - Crew Gold Corporation Senior Secured Bond Issue 2006/2011 with call option (collectively the "Bondholders")
Oslo, 6 January 2010
Adjustment of interest payment due 30 March 2010
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") has been appointed as loan trustee for the above mentioned bond issue where Crew Gold Corporation (the "Borrower") is issuer and borrower.
"Crew Gold Corporation Senior Secured Bond Issue 2006/2011 with call option", consist of a NOK tranche (the "NOK Tranche") with ISIN NO 001 030730.9 and a USD tranche (the "USD Tranche") with ISIN NO 001 030731.7. The two tranches are collectively referred to as the "Loan".
On 30 December 2009 the Borrower made an interest payment on the Loan. However, the Borrower paid too much interest to the bondholders at this particular Interest Payment Date. Due to a mistake the Borrower paid interest on the whole principal for the whole interest period even if 50 % of the principal was converted into shares during the interest period. The Borrower was not supposed to pay interest on the converted principal for the period after 11 December 2009, which was the cut off date for all calculations, in all loans, related to the closing of the restructuring.
The Borrower has decided that it will deduct the amount over paid on 30 December 2009 from the interest payment due on 30 March 2010.
The bonds have been blocked for any trades in VPS since 10 December 2009 and will remain blocked to and including 14 January 2010. Since the Bondholders now is identical to the bondholders who received the interest payment on 30 December 2009 the Loan Trustee find the approach, chosen by the Borrower, to be reasonable and do not see any reason to refuse such course of action.
As a consequence of the above, the Borrower intends to pay interest, for the current interest period, based on the following rates:
· NOK Tranche - 5.68489 % p.a. · USD Tranche - 4.52988 % p.a.
Yours sincerely Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
