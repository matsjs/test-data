Market outlook
The present utilisation of the worldwide semisubmersible accommodation fleet for 2012 stands at approximately 95%. The market is expected to remain tight during the coming years due to high demand and shortage of capacity, meaning that higher day rates can be expected in the short term. In the North Sea region, all DP rigs are committed in 2012 and 2013, with only one anchored rig available during this period.

FLOATEL
INTERNATIONAL

A number of North Sea sector capable new building orders have been placed recently including Floatel International ordering its 4th vessel (Floatel Endurance), Prosafe ordering a second new build rig for delivery mid 2015 and Axis Offshore ordering its first semi submersible rig from China. This means that the North Sea accommodation fleet will increase from present 6 rigs to 11 rigs by end 2015. In addition, Cotemar has a benign environment newbuild unit under construction, targeting Mexico.
The utilisation rate for the worldwide semi submersible accommodation fleet is already just over 50% in 2013 and is expected to increase once the Mexican state oil company Pemex renews their contracts for the fleet presently engaged in that region.
Several oil companies are in the market for work in the period 2014 and beyond and increased activity is expected in the North Sea region as well as in Brazil and Australia.
We believe that the availability of quality semi submersible accommodation market will

remain tight during the coming years, due to the continued high activity levels, especially for rigs equipped with DP. Several clients are also specifying age restrictions meaning that there is a preference for newer rigs. It should be noted that out of the 27 semisubmersible accommodation rigs in operation or under construction, 18 rigs were built before 1987, with an average age of 31 years.
Significant events after the end of the reporting period
Floatel Superior has since August 2012 been located at the Njord Field some 70 nm northwest of Kristiansund. In the early hours of 7 November 2012, one anchor came loose from the anchor rack causing damage to adjacent ballast tanks. As a safety measure it was decided to evacuate all non essential personnel to an adjacent platform in the area and for the vessel to relocate to port for repair. The actual period required before vessel is back in operation will be advised after inspection of the damage has been thoroughly assessed.

Hamilton - 13 November 2012 The Board of Directors of Floatel International Ltd.
This interim report has been subjected to a limited review by the Company's auditors.
