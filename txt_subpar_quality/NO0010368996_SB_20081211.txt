(ii) During the Waiver Period, freeze the amount currently standing to the credit on the Escrow Account as security for the Loan (USD 16 million),
(iii) During the Waiver Period, the Trustee (acting on behalf of the Bondholders) shall appoint a legal advisor at the expense of the Borrower to undertake a legal due diligence of the Borrower in cooperation with the Borrower, within a total cap of up to maximum of USD 200,000. A summary of any findings which could reasonably be deemed to be of relevance to the bondholders shall be published by the Company to the market as a company update or as part of the monthly update in (i) above as soon as possible after completion of such due diligence. In order for the Bondholders to get access to the full due diligence report, each Bondholder will need to sign a non disclosure agreement (NDA) with the Company.
(iv) Remaining cash from the convertible bond issue and the share issues and other free cash within the Group shall be employed solely for costs related to (i) the CJ70 under construction (the "Rig" or the "CJ70 project" at the Yard, (ii) the FPSO indirectly owned by the Borrower currently under conversion at the Yard, and (iii) SG&A (including, without limitation, interest costs, insurance and management fees)
(v) Include in the Loan Security for the Loan; (i) a second priority assignment in the management agreement with Larsen Oil & Gas for the Rig, (ii) a second priority assignment in any employment contracts entered into for the Rig, and (iii) a second priority assignment over equipment supply contracts entered into for the BOP (Hydril), Diverter (Vetco) and Cranes (NOV) (as a floating charge) which is ordered as owner furnished equipment, which security interest shall rank behind the Better Priority Debt (as defined in the Loan Agreement).
Background
The background for the Proposal is the challenging equity markets experienced today, which generally makes it extremely difficult for issuers to raise equity. In addition, the major shareholder in the Borrower (Petrojack ASA, 42.2% owner) has limited free cash holdings for the time being, rendering it unable to participate in any equity raise at this point in time. A share issue in the Borrower without participation and support by its largest shareholder is deemed unrealistic in the current market conditions. Pending fixing of employment for the FPSO and/or the Rig, the magnitude of Borrower's remaining financing need makes it in the opinion of the Company and its financial advisor very difficult to raise the equity within the time limit originally envisaged in Clause 6.6.
For the CJ70 project the Company initially raised USD 80 million of equity and USD 185 million through the Loan. The USD 45 million equity raise required per 31 December 2008 in the Loan Agreement was intended on the back of the initial funding plan for the CJ70 project where a shortfall of liquidity was anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2008. In November 2007 the Company issued a convertible bond of NOK 750 million. Due to this, the cash balance of the Company is now higher than initially anticipated.

N O R SK T IL L IT SM A N N ASA
Based on the initial payment schedule agreed with the Yard and equipment suppliers relative to the FPSO as well as the CJ70 project, a liquidity shortfall was expected in early 2009. Actions have now been taken to mitigate this risk, as the Borrower is in the process of renegotiating payment terms with its vendors and the Yard. A written approval has already been given by the board of the Yard to postpone USD 57.5 million of the installment originally due on the CJ70 project on October 31st 2008 until end June 2009 provided that the Borrower does not default under the Loan Agreement.
Evaluation of the Proposal
It is the opinion of PetroProd that the Bondholders are offered a fair and balanced offer by the proposed amendments to the Loan Agreements.
Based on the information given to the Trustee by the Company based on the Company Update attached, the current cash position is anticipated to be sufficient to meet the Company's budgeted cost and expenses till June. Taken into account today's challenging equity market; it is understandable that the Company would like to await the equity issuance until early next year. Further, the Company undertakes to give the Bondholders a monthly update, a legal due diligence, as well as offering the Bondholders an extended security package for its Bonds (the Bondholders should however be aware of the hardening period of such extended security package). Therefore, the Trustee share the Company's view that the Bondholders is offered a fair and balanced offer and the Trustee recommends the Bondholders to approve the Proposal. Nevertheless, the Bondholders themselves must evaluate, based on all information given from the Company, whether such proposed Waiver Period should be accepted.
For further information about the involved company, please also refer to the web site www.petroprod.com or www.newsweb.no (for press releases from the Borrower).
The Borrower has engaged Pareto Securities AS as the Borrower's financial advisor with respect to the Proposal. Accordingly, Bondholders may contact Pareto Securities for further information. Pareto Securities is acting solely for the Borrower and no-one else in connection with the Proposal. No due diligence investigations have been carried out by Pareto Securities with respect to the Borrower and Pareto Securities expressly disclaims any and all liability whatsoever in connection with the Proposal (including but not limited to the information contained herein and in the Company Update enclosed to this summons).

Company Update

11 December 2008

In order for you as bondholders to assess the situation in further detail, we have prepared a short update on our ongoing construction projects, as well as some more detailed information on our financial situation and budgets going forward.

1.0 Construction and markets

The CJ70 project is progressing well, according to a revised delivery date of 30 September 2010. The reason for the 3 month deferred delivery date is to bring more float in engineering progress to suit the shipyard's construction method.

As of end November, detailed engineering progress was approximately 60% complete, whilst construction progress stood at 22%. All major equipment has been purchased. Block fabrication and assembly in dock are ongoing. Spud cans are also under assembly. Leg materials delivery is according to plan.

The market balance for our target niche market on the Norwegian Continental Shelf remains favorable, where in our opinion demand exceeds the supply for the foreseeable future. We have currently provided bids for three major tenders where we see the use of a harsh environment jack-up rig of CJ70 design as the preferred solution. However, due to the financial market turmoil currently experienced, it is uncertain whether or to what extent these tenders will be concluded according to plan in the short term. We are nevertheless optimistic that a contract could be obtained within a 3-6 months perspective. We are in parallel also continuously evaluating and working with other strategic alternatives for the Rig, which may include a direct sale of the Rig, a joint venture partner or another financial solution.

The conversion of the M/T Arc is continuing according to a revised schedule, with planned completion on or about 3Q 2009, which is somewhat later than originally planned. All major equipment is complete and received on site or ready for shipment. Topside modules are complete and stored at the supplier's (GSI) Singapore yard. Currently most of the work related to the FPSO is deferred, awaiting an employment contract or another financial solution for this unit. We foresee that several announced field developments by small and independent E&P companies will be put on hold due to the financial turmoil and drop in oil prices. This indicates that our targeted FPSO market will continue to be difficult. We are currently in discussion with vendors to the project to postpone payments, which are progressing. This will affect the timing of payments and eventually the delivery date for the unit. The co-operation with the Yard is working well.

In addition to continuing the search for employment, we are currently working on two main leads for the FPSO, which involve (i) a direct sale of the unit, and (ii) a sale of the unit on the back of a contract. The first lead is given the highest probability for success of the two, although still uncertain in today's market. The latter lead will eventually take longer to accomplish with a somewhat lower probability for success.

Regarding the two aframax tankers, reference is made to the announcements made on November 27th and December 1st 2008, which confirmed the agreement to sell M/T Archimid and M/T Trust to a European buyer. The closing is expected to take place by mid December 2008. The net cash payment to PetroProd under this transaction will be USD 22 million. An upfront payment of 20% has been received as of today. This realization will however trigger a mandatory prepayment of USD 24 million of the FRN bond at 103% of par plus accrued interest on redeemed amount.

2,0 Financials

As of the date of this summons our total cash balance consisted of (i) USD 16.1 million on escrow account in favor of the Bondholders (please note that this is after payment of the December installment of USD 19.5 million on December 1st), (ii) USD 20.4 million on escrow in favor of the FRN bond, and (iii) approximately NOK 394.5 million (USD 56 million at USD:NOK 7.00) of remaining proceeds from the convertible bond, in total USD 92.5 million. Based on a revised payment schedule to vendors in the Rig and the FPSO projects, we anticipate that the liquidity will last until June 2009 before new funding will be needed (please refer to budgets below for details). In our budgets we have allocated the remaining proceeds from the convertible bond approximately as follows; (i) 2/3 for the CJ70 project and (ii) 1/3 for the FPSO project.

Per end November 2008 the remaining cost to complete the Rig was estimated to USD 350 million, while the remaining cash to complete (without allocation of proceeds from convertible bond) is estimated to USD 314.2 million1 (excluding the expected mobilization cost). The total project cost is estimated to USD 607 million. The deviation versus the initial budget of USD 560 million relates mainly to;

USD 314.2 million = USD 349.8 million (remaining cost to complete) - USD 19.5 million (December installment paid)-U SD 16.1 million (escrowed cash)

Currently most of the work related to the FPSO is deferred, awaiting an employment contract or another financial solution for the unit. The delivery date and actual cost and timing of payments will therefore be dependent on this. The cash flow budget below assumes postponement of several payments not yet confirmed. Discussions with vendors are progressing. We will continue to monitor our cash flow positions and there may be some unexpected changes which do not allow us to live up to our assumptions.
