Rubicon's Target Market



Target clients

· Rubicon primarily targets small to medium-sized fields with up to 50m bbls of oil reserves
· Mid-size independent oil & gas players
- May be well-funded with strong balance sheet, but often lack full project execution resources

- Development tenure does not justify investing significant capital

· Investors, small independents, individuals
- Typically lacking in balance sheet strength, but able to raise project-based funding on a low-risk, high deliverability development

· Creates opportunities for Rubicon - may require Rubicon's commercial help to get a project off the ground - potential for:
- Increased up-front cash from production

- Greater tariff/field equity

RRUBICON OFFSHORE HOLDINGS

Several operational challenges have had a material impact on profitability and cash flows
Capex · Capex increases on vessel conversions and delivery delays for the two FPSOs
Environmental issues · Rubicon Intrepid - environmental (weather/currents) issues - incidents leading to significant repair costs
and downtime (lost day rate)
Other issues · Rubicon Maverick - achieved utilization and day rates significantly below expectations (soft demand and
competition from un-contracted new vessels) · Vessel operating expenses above expectations · SG&A expenses higher than expected

.sis-. . SHiöiä# Proposal to Bondholders

RRUBICON OFFSHORE HOLDINGS

Merits of the proposal
· Proactively addresses potential shortfall of cash in April 2011 with existing amortization profile · New terms better match debt profile with projected cash generating capacity · Projected cash sweep of US$85m from 2011 to 2014 · Improved likelihood of successful refinancing at maturity (residual debt reduced from
~US$120m to ~US$70m) · Total projected cashflow to bondholders increased from US$194m to US$215m

29

Proposal to Bondholders
Rubicon wishes to proactively address upfront any potential issues that might arise in April 2011 and desires to achieve a more permanent solution that would create value for all stakeholders Shareholders have already, injected US$47m of further equity in addition to US$36m that had already been invested at the time of the bond issue. They will not provide more financing Proposal provides a long-term solution and better matches the Company's debt profile with projected cash generating capacity No haircut and focuses on full repayment of bondholders' principal, as well as continued payment of interest and amortization - should improve credit for bondholders The reduction in residual debt at maturity improves likelihood of successful refinancing Addresses amortization issue well in advance, hence removing "last minute" value destroying situation and maintains management focus on business and operations Change of control trigger acts as a hindrance to strategic initiatives in a consolidating sector which should be potentially credit enhancing and positive for all stakeholders.
