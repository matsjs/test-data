2. Conduct of the Administration
Purpose of the Administration
2.1 Pursuant to Paragraph 3 of the Schedule B1 of the Act, the purpose of the administration is realising property in order to make a distribution to creditors.
2.2 We considered that the administration would give a better outcome than could be achieved in liquidations of the Company as the appointment process could be conducted quickly, with the consent of the Secured Lender.
Huntington licenses and other entitlements 2.3 As reported previously, in addition to the 15% interest in the Huntington field, Huntington also owns the following
entitlements: 1.2% royalty entitlement from Premier Oil UK Limited ("Premier"); 0.6% royalty entitlement from Noreco Denmark A/S ("Noreco"); and 0.75% disproportionate lifting entitlement ("DLE") with Eon.
2.4 As previously reported, we agreed a termination of the royalty entitlement with Premier for $0.9m, which was received on 25 January 2016.
2.5 No interest was received in the marketing process in relation to Huntington's 15% license interest, and a default was persisting at the commencement of the administration. On 29 January 2016 we received notice from the joint operating partners stating that, pursuant to the default, they were exercising their rights to acquire Huntington's interest. On 22 September 2017 the transfer of the interest in the Huntington field to Premier was completed. Following the transfer all claims against the Company from Premier were released.
Receipts and payments during the Period 2.6 Please find at Appendix B the receipts and payments account for the Company. 2.7 The material receipts and payments during the Period are listed below:

EXPERTS WITH IMPACTTM

Joint Administrators' Final Report
Receipts  VAT refund of 135k;  Insurance refund of 46k
Payments  Floating charge creditor distribution of funds remaining in administration estate of 1,978k to Security Trustee.
Taxation 2.8 All corporation tax returns have been submitted and HMRC has not raised any queries. 2.9 All relevant VAT returns have been submitted and the company has now been deregistered from VAT. Statutory Investigations 2.10 As reported previously, we have concluded our statutory investigation work in accordance with SIP2, and complied with our
statutory duties pursuant to the Companies Directors Disqualification Act 1986. Work streams during the Period 2.11 During the Period the main work streams that have been finalised are as follows:
 Completing the transfer of the interest in the Huntington field to Premier;  Submitting and obtaining a VAT refund of 135k;  Submitting and obtaining an insurance fund of 46k;  Issuing a notice of intended dividend to potential unsecured creditors;  Final distribution of 1.98m to the Security Trustee.
3. Summary creditor returns
Secured creditors 3.1 At the date of the appointment the Secured Creditors were owed $263m by the Company and Iona. The Secured Creditors held
a number of securities which were listed in the SIP 16 letter to creditors and included as Appendix G in the Administrators' proposals dated 9 February 2016. 3.2 The amount due to the secured creditors was net of $57.1m restricted cash which had been distributed to the Security Trustee prior to the date of appointment. Of this amount $50m was distributed by the Security Trustee to bondholders with the remaining $7m held as contingency. 3.3 A final distribution of 1.98m was made from the Company to the Security Trustee on 13 November 2017. Preferential creditors 3.4 There are no preferential in the Company. Unsecured creditors 3.5 Unsecured creditors rank behind both secured and preferential creditors. 3.6 Under Section 176A of the Act where after 15 September 2003 the company has granted a creditor a floating charge, a proportion of the net property of the company achieved from floating charge asset realisations must be made available for the unsecured creditors ("the Prescribed Part"). 3.7 There are unlikely to be sufficient funds to repay the Secured Creditors in full, therefore returns to unsecured creditors will come from the Prescribed Part only. 3.8 The Prescribed Part applies where there are net floating charge realisations (i.e. after costs of realisation) available to unsecured creditors and is calculated as follows:  50% of net property up to 10k  Plus 20% of net property in excess of 10k

Joint Administrators' Final Report
 Subject to a maximum of 600k
3.9 We wrote to all known creditors on 28 September 2017 requesting unsecured creditors to prove their debts against the Company by the last date of proving, 24 October 2017. No claims were received.
4. Summary of Proposals and Exit Route
4.1 The administrators' proposals, prepared under the Insolvency Rules 1986 (as amended), are included below as required by Rule 3.53 (Formerly Rule 2.110) of the Rules. There have been no amendments or deviations from these proposals.
Proposed Strategy, Actions and Activities
 The Administrators will continue to manage the affairs of the Company in order to achieve the purpose of the Administration.
 To do all such other things and generally exercise all of our powers as contained in Schedule B1 of the Act, as the Administrators consider desirable or expedient to achieve the statutory purpose of the Administration.
 To investigate and as appropriate pursue any claims the Company may have.
 We shall be authorised to agree the claims of the secured and unsecured creditors against each of the Company unless we conclude, in our reasonable opinion, that the respective company in administration will have no assets available for distribution.
 We shall be authorised to distribute funds to the secured and preferential creditors (if applicable) as and when claims are agreed and funds permit.
 In relation to potential distributions to unsecured creditorsby virtue of a Prescribed Part, we are authorised to do so in accordance with S128(2) of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 ("SBEEA") and its amendment to Paragraph 65(3) of Schedule B1 of the Act.
Creditors Committee
 In the event the creditors of any of the Company so determine a creditors' committee be appointed in respect of that company, the committee shall comprise no more than five and not less than three creditors of that company.
Proposed Exit Routes
 The most likely exit route for the Company is moving to dissolution after the completion of its Administration.
 Once all assets have been realised and if applicable, a distribution paid to unsecured creditors by virtue of a Prescribed Part (in accordance with S128(2) of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 ("SBEEA") and its amendment to Paragraph 65(3) of Schedule B1 of the Act) the Administrators will file for the dissolution of Huntington pursuant to Paragraph 84 of Schedule B1 to the Act.
Discharge of Administrators
 The Administrators will be discharged from liability in accordance with Paragraph 98(1) of Schedule B1 of the Act immediately upon their appointment as Administrators ceasing to have effect.
Administrators' Remuneration
 If a creditors committee is appointed by the creditors of the Company, that committee will be asked to agree that the basis of the Administrators' remuneration in respect of the corresponding company be fixed by reference to the time properly given by the Administrators' and their staff in attending to matters arising in the Administration, calculated at the prevailing standard hourly charge out rates used by FTI at the time when the work is performed, plus VAT, and be asked to agree any category 2 expenses.
 If a creditors committee is not appointed by the creditors of the Company, the Secured Creditor (and preferential creditors where applicable) of the corresponding company shall be asked, in accordance with Rule 2.106(5A)(a) of the Rules to fix the basis of the Administrators' remuneration by reference to the time properly given by the Administrators' and their staff in attending to matters arising in the Administration, calculated at the prevailing standard hourly charge out rates used by FTI at the time when the work is performed, plus VAT.
4.2 This report will be filed with the Registrar of Companies pursuant to Rule 3.61 (formerly Rule 2.118) of the Rules and the administration will conclude by moving straight to dissolution. There will therefore be no further reports to creditors.

Joint Administrators' Final Report

Appendix E - Additional Information in relation to Administrators' fees pursuant to SIP9
Detailed below is FTI's policy in relation to:  staff allocation and the use of sub-contractors;  professional advisors; and  disbursements.
Staff allocation and the use of subcontractors
Our general approach to resourcing our assignments is to allocate staff with the skills and experience to meet the specific requirements of the case. The constitution of the case team will usually consist of a Senior Managing Director, Managing Director, Director, Senior Consultant and Consultant. The exact constitution of the case team will depend on the anticipated size and complexity of the assignment. With regard to support staff, we would advise that time spent by cashiers in relation to specific tasks on an assignment is charged. Only if there is a large block of time incurred by a member of the secretarial team, e.g., report compilation and distribution, do we seek to charge and recover our time in this regard.
Professional advisors
On this assignment we have used the professional advisors listed below. We have also indicated alongside, the basis of our fee arrangement with them, which is subject to review on a regular basis.

Name of professional advisor
CMS Cameron McKenna LLP and Thomessen (legal advice) HBJ Gateley/ Addleshaw Goddard (Huntington license matters) RSM (payroll services)

Basis of fee arrangement
Hourly rate and disbursements Hourly rate and disbursements Fixed fee per payroll

Fees paid to date ()
43,568 30,192
210

Our choice was based on our view of their experience and ability to perform this type of work, the complexity and nature of the assignment and the basis of our fee arrangement with them.
We have utilized the services of other teams within FTI Consulting LLP to assist with the Administration processes. The fees of our tax, technology and strategic communication teams have been included in our SIP9 analysis provided to creditors of the Companies and allocated to the work streams and entities to which their work related.
We consider that the rates chargeable for these services are in line with general market practice and that the service is comparable to similar firms of professional advisors. In addition, by working closely with our internal teams, we believe a more coordinated and costeffective approach to the Administration work streams has been possible.
Disbursements
Category 1 disbursements do not require approval by creditors. The type of disbursements that may be charged as a Category 1 disbursement to a case generally comprise of external supplies of incidental services specifically identifiable to the case, such as postage, case advertising, invoiced travel and external printing, room hire and document storage. Also chargeable will be any properly reimbursed expenses incurred by personnel in connection with the case.
Category 2 disbursements do require approval from creditors. These disbursements can include costs incurred which relate to payments due to associated companies for the provision of services to the office holder.
