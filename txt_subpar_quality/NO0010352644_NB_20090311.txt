Attention: Lars Moldestad
11 March 2009
Dear Sirs
NOK 1.6 billion FRN bonds (the "Bonds") issued by Petrorig III Pte Ltd (the "Company")
We refer to the bondholder meeting held today in connection with the above referenced Bond issue. As you will be aware, the proposals put to the Bondholders at that meeting were not approved. As you know, and further to correspondence between us on this matter, on 20 February 2009 you failed to raise an additional $50m in equity (the "Equity Raise") as required by Clause 13.2(d)(iii) of the loan agreement with respect to the Bonds (the "Loan Agreement"). Accordingly, unless the Company has raised this additional equity before the expiry of the 15 Banking Day grace period on 13 March 2009 (the "Grace Period"), there will be an Event of Default under Clause 15.1(b) the Loan Agreement.
Based on discussions we have had with Bondholders, we believe that the Bondholders perceived the Company's proposals as being too aggressive, and the proposed deferral period too long, given the current lack of clarity on the prospects of the Company finding a long-term and comprehensive solution to its funding needs. However, we believe that there is a reasonable prospect of obtaining support from Bondholders for an alternative proposal in relation to the Company's obligations with respect to the Equity Raise.
In order to allow discussions with Bondholders to take place, and to maintain stability at the Company, we would be prepared to grant an extension to the Grace Period. We therefore confirm that, based on current support from Bondholders owning an aggregate amount of approx. 40 % of the outstanding Bonds, the Grace Period shall be extended, and shall not expire on 13 March 2009, until such time as we give you 2 Banking Days' written notice of the expiry of the Grace Period.
All our rights and the rights of the Bondholders in respect of the Bonds and the Loan Agreement are hereby reserved including with respect to the Equity Raise, the Grace Period and any other breaches or defaults which may have arisen under the Bonds.
