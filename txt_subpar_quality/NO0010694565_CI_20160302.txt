World Wide Supply
Quarterly interim report Q4 2015

World W id e S u p p ly
The quarter in brief World Wide Supply AS owns six Platform Supply Vessels. All delivered from Damen Shipyard.
Four Vessels are laid up and two vessels are on contract with Petrobras in Brazil.
At the end of the last quarter the Company was in material breach of the bond agreement, which continues to be in breach, and the bondholders have reserved their rights to declare an event of default under the bond agreement. During the last quarter the bondholders had difficult negotiations with the Company about finding a solution to the present financial difficulties. Lack of progress and a realistic chance of an agreement led to a decision that that the bondholders through Nordic Trustee ASA an interim safeguard measure acquired over all the shares of the Company through a voluntary offer accepted by all the shareholders. The new 100% owner, WWS recovery AS, and took possession of the shares on the 28thof December. As of the same date, the board resigned and Aage Figenschou was elected sole board member. The Company has not been able to resolve its debt position which continues to be challenging and may lead to the vessels being sold under the current market conditions, but the Company has received comfort from the bondholders that any new trade creditors will be paid in full from the Company's cash, even under enforcement of the securities, thereby enabling the Company to continue trading in a way where the contracting arrangements for the vessels are not disturbed.
In the 3rdquarter the Company accrued as a receivable in its balance sheet time charter hire the Company viewed as owed to it from Petrobras for the period when the certificates were not renewed (June 10th and June 20th 2015) until September 9th when the charters were terminated. The claim has been denied by Petrobras and any collection will require a lengthy legal proceeding which may or may not be successful. This income has therefore been reversed in the 4th quarter.
World Wide Supply Group's operating income for the fourth quarter was in USD and BRL equivalent to NOK 3,5 million. Due to change of reporting currency, income reported in the first three quarters and reversal of accruals of the Petrobras income, the operational income is low. For actual operational income see note 3.
The EBITDA in the 4th quarter was negative with NOK 60,1 million and EBIT was negative with NOK 796,4 million after deduction of NOK 736,3 million in depreciation and impairment. Net financial expenses were NOK 79,7 million (of which NOK 25,6 million was unrealized agio) resulting in a pre-tax loss of NOK 876,1 million. As a result of the Company being in breach of its loan agreements the Company cannot report financially as a going concern.
Operations Average utilization of the fleet was 32,5 % for the 4thquarter and 62,1 % for the year.
Two vessels are on four years contract with Petrobras in Brazil until June 2018, based on yearly renewal of the CAA (Certificate of Charter Authorization) and AIT (Registration Certificate of temporary foreign Vessel).
Four vessels are laid-up.
Profit and loss Q4 2015 Operating income was equivalent to NOK 3,5 million for Q4, while operating expenses were NOK 63,7 million. Total depreciation and write down was NOK 736,3 million. Due to change of reporting currency, income reported in the first three quarters and reversal of accruals Petrobras income the operational income is low. For actual operational income see note 3.

The Company received broker evaluations of the fleet giving an average value per vessel of USD 16-24 million. These evaluations are always given on the assumption that there is a market with a willing seller and a willing buyer and that the Company is a going concern. Since in theory the assets may have to be disposed of within a short timeframe the Company has investigated the market for such a sale. The conclusion is that the vessels should be written down to USD 10 million pr vessel. This leads to an impairment in our books of NOK 735,5 million. Net result before tax for Q4 was negative with NOK 876,1 million. The tax for 2015 is calculated to NOK 116,5 million.
Profit and loss 1.1. - 31.12.2015 (1.1. - 31.12.2014)_________________________________________________ Operating income was equivalent to NOK 217,9 (253,2) million for the year 2015 (2014) while operating expenses were NOK 233,2 (193,1) million. Depreciation and write down was No K 770,8 (35,1) million. Net financial expenses were NOK 250,0 (193,7) million including unrealized currency loss of net NOK 114,9 (131,1) million related to loan granted to subsidiaries in EUR. Net result before tax was negative with NOK 1 036,1 (168,7) million.
Balance sheet per 31.12.2015 (per 31.12.2014) Total assets were NOK 549,0 (1 455,0) million. Tangible fixed assets amounted to NOK 472,5 (1 295,6) million. According to the impairment test the average value per vessel were USD 10 million, equivalent to NOK 88,09 million. The group's current assets were NOK 76,5 (159,6) million of which cash equivalents corresponded to NOK 32,9 (84,8) million. Book equity as per 31.12.2015 was NOK -882,2 million based on conversion of EUR to NOK at rates on delivery dates for the vessels. At the balance sheet date of 31.12.2015 the Group had long term interest bearing debt in the amount of USD 150 million. The working capital was NOK -1 274,4 million at 31.12.2015 compared to NOK 129,8 million at 31.12.2014.
Market outlook The Company is facing a long period of depressed market rates. On a global basis approx. 500 OSV are in lay-up and approx. 100 OSVs are in lay up in the North Sea. Investment budgets for the oil companies are still being reduced contracting the demand for oil service assets. The board does not expect any consistent market improvement for several years.

Financial risk The major financial risk confronting the Company is that it is in breach of its obligations under the loan agreement. Interest has not been paid since August. This default has not been waived by the lenders but agreed to leave interest falling due as unpaid until further notice. Since the Company is constantly taking on new debt in form of new trade creditors, the lenders have agreed to allow the company the use of its cash to pay these, even in the case of an enforcement of the securities.
Employees The Group had at December 31th 2015 68 employees of which 64 sailors including hired personnel.
Subsequent events In 2016 the management agreement with Sydvestor AS was terminated with effect from January 31. The lenders have, in spite of the default, asked the board and management to continue the operations of the Company and not file for bankruptcy. In this respect an agreement has been entered into reflected in the chapter on financial risk.
