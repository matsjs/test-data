To the bondholders in: ISIN: NO 001 035624.9 - 9,25% Delphin Kreuzfahrten GmbH 2007/2012
Oslo, 6 October 2011
Delphin Kreuzfahrten GmbH - Repayment
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NT") is trustee for the above mentioned loan. Reference is made to previous notices. The Issuer is under bankruptcy proceedings in Germany, and the vessel is arrested in Venice in Italy. No solution involving sale o f the vessel has so far materialized and no solutions seems to be found in the near future. Any further enforcement proceedings are unlikely to give a higher return to the Bondholders than amount on the Escrow Account. Accordingly, NT and the Bondholders' Committee have decided to pay out an amount of NOK 4 000 000 from the Escrow Account. The payment will be made on 11 October 2011, and will constitute 3.6288 per cent out the outstanding principal under the bond issue. The record date will be 7 October 2011. NT will still monitor any insolvency proceedings; however, as the value of the vessel depreciates, no further proceeds may be anticipated. An amount of approximately NOK 200 000 is held back in order to meet potential future cost.
Yours sincerely NorskJBUitsmann ASA
