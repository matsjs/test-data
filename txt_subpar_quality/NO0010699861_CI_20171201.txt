Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 - Accounting Principles
General information
The North Alliance AS is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Norway with offices at Kristian IV's gate 15 in Oslo.
Basis of preparation
These condensed interim financial statements for the nine months ended 30 September 2017 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, 'Interim financial reporting'. The condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 of NoA AS and condensed interim financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2017 of NoA AS, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union ('IFRS').
Accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016, and the interim financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2017.
Estimates, judgm ents and assum ptions
The preparation of interim financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In preparing these condensed interim financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 and condensed interim financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2017.

Note 3 Seasonality

Historically we have seen a higher activity level in late Q3 and Q4 compared to Q1 and Q2. The main factors explaining this are the higher number of marketing campaigns that typically are run by our clients in Q3 and Q4, and the fact that Q3 and Q4 in total have more hours available for client deliveries.
