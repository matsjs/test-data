(SIN NO 001035463.2 - FRN Sea Production Ltd Bond Issue 2007/2014 Oslo, 6 February 2013
Re. Interest Payments due 14 February 2013 Sea Production has informed us that they have insufficient Available Cash (as defined in the Bond Agreement, as amended) to pay accrued interest in cash. According to the Bond Agreement, the coupon for the current interest period shall therefore be increased from Libor plus 10 percentage points per annum to Libor plus 13 percentage points per annum, which shall be paid by issuance of additional Bonds (PIK payment).
