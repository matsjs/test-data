The North Alliance AS - Q4 2015 Interim report

Introduction
The North Alliance AS (NOA) is a group of companies offering services within marketing communication, design and technology. The family of companies operates in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, and Singapore.

The group was founded on January 23, 2014 when NOA acquired the following companies:

- Making Waves Group (NO, SE and PL) - Åkestam Holst Group
o Åkestam Holst (SE) o Bold (SE, DK) o StudioNOC (SE) o Promenad (SE) - Great Works (SE, DK) - AndCo (DK)

Design & Technology
Advertising Design Brand Experience Action Marketing and CRM Digital communication Advertising

In addition, Anorak (NO, Advertising) was acquired in October 2014 and in January 2015 NOA established the advertising company Acoustic in Singapore, a digital centric company that will work in the cross section between communication and technology. During Q4 2015, Bold has established operations in Oslo, in addition to the current locations in Stockholm and Copenhagen.

In January 2016 NOA acquired the Swedish/American digital development and communication company Nansen. Nansen has over 100 employees in Stockholm, Chicago and New York. The acquisition of Nansen will strengthen the Groups digital offering in the Swedish market and will together with Making Waves become a strong entity in the Nordics.

Financials
Total YTD net revenues as of December 31 2015 were 534.4 MNOK, up 19% from 2014. The growth in revenues comes largely from group-wide projects where NOA-companies have won significant multidiscipline projects across the Nordic region, as well as from the acquisition of Anorak AS in Q3 2014. The EBITDA for the same period came in at 20.7 MNOK, compared to a negative 4 MNOK for 2014.

On December 20, 2013 NOA entered into a Bond Agreement. The Bond issue was subsequently listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. NOA undertakes to comply with the certain financial covenants during the term of the Bond issue, and after Q4 2015 the company is in compliance with all such covenants. Due to good cash conversion across the group, NOA bought back 11.7 MNOK of its outstanding bonds in February 2015.

Outlook
We expect the positive development of 2015 to continue. The focus is now to utilize the NOA's Nordic digital capabilities as efficient as possible and be ready for further growth across the region.

Note 6 Seasonality
Historically we have seen a higher activity level in Q3 and Q4 compared to Q1 and Q2. The main factors explaining this are the higher number of marketing campaigns that typically are run by our clients in Q3 and Q4, and the fact that Q3 and Q4 in total have more hours available for client deliveries.
