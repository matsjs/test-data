To the bondholders in:
ISIN: N00010604705 -8.0 per cent Cecon 1 AS and Cecon Shipping 2 AS Tranche B Senior Secured Callable and Putable Bond Issue 2011/2016
ISIN: N00010364250 - 8.0 per cent Cecon Shipping 1 AS and Cecon Shipping 2 AS Tranche C1 Senior Secured Callable and Putable Bond Issue 2011/2016
ISIN: N00010506728 -8.0 per cent Cecon Shipping 1 AS and Cecon Shipping 2 AS Tranche C2 Senior Secured Callable and Putable Bond Issue 2011/2016
Oslo, 1 April 2016
Non-payment of outstanding amount Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the Bondholders in the abovementioned bond issues (the "Bond Issues"), where Cecon Shipping 2 AS and Cecon Shipping 1 AS are the Issuers, (the "Issuers") and which is documented in a second amended and restated bond loan agreement adopted through an amendment and restatement agreement dated 20 February 2013 (as further amended, the "Bond Agreement").
Capitalised terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Bond Agreement.
Please be advised that the Issuers for the Bond Issues with ISIN N00010364250 ("Tranche Cl Bonds") and NOOOl 0506728 ("Tranche C2 Bonds") have not redeemed the Bonds on the Maturity Date, being 18 March 2016, in accordance with the Bond Agreement.
The Bond Issue with ISIN NOOOl0604705 ("Tranche B Bonds") adopted the proposal to extend the Maturity Date to 18 March 2017 in the Bondholders' Meeting held 17 March 2016. However, due to the failure to redeem all other outstanding Bond Issues issued by the Issuers, the Bond Issue with ISIN N00010604705 ("Tranche B Bonds") deems to be in default as of 18 March 2016.
Please note that, as a technical measure in order to avoid cancellation and discharge of the Bonds in the Norwegian Security Depositoiy ("VPS"), which will happen automatically upon maturity of the Bonds, we have requested that the Bonds are not withdrawn and discharged. This will not have any effect on the payment obligation of the Issuers nor the default interest accrued under the Bond Issues.
Yours sincerely Nordic Trustee ASA
