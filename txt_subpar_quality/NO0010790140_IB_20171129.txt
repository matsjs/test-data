Operational comments
The main highlights of the quarter were the solid revenue growth of 12 percent over 2016 to MNOK 186.2 for the group. All geographic areas are contributing to the growth. Higher activity and new clients are the main reason for the revenue growth. Contributing to the higher activity is a continuing net growth in registered vehicles and higher road side assistance (RSA) frequency in line with technological development and user behavior. In Denmark and Sweden, Viking additionally benefits from a strengthening of the Viking brand which yields both new clients and direct end user RSA requisitions.
1H17 revenue is in line with 1H16, however, the revenue is stronger than it appears when taking into account the effects of adverse winter conditions during 1Q17. Number of assistances during 1Q17 exemplifies the effects of a mild winter vs normal conditions. Total number of assistances during 1Q17 ended 16 500 assistances fewer than same period 2016 or ~17 percent, and accounts for approx. MNOK 8,5 gross margin shortfall. Operations must still account for full readiness to handle winter conditions should they appear, offering little relief for the cost base.
The group assistance gross margin is improving and Norway in particular is showing strong margins during the quarter compared to same period last year. Denmark is also showing satisfactory margins as new clients are added with positive contribution, while strong focus is ongoing to improve margins in Sweden.
Another major event for Viking was the refinancing completed in April. The new financing solution strengthens the company's financial position and reduces our annual financial costs. The new MNOK 60 secured bank facility underwritten by DNB Bank ASA and MNOK 500 senior

secured bond and MSEK 207 junior secured bond were announced in March and subsequently signed and allocated on 4 April. The proceeds of the refinancing has since been used to part-finance the full redemption of our MNOK 263 senior facilities agreement with DNB as well as our mezzanine facility and subordinated loan note to ICG totaling MNOK 447. We have reduced the interest costs across the underwritten secured bank facilities and the new bond issues at the point of the refinancing. This will yield lower interest cost, improved cash flow and increased flexibility for us going forward.
The end of June marked the final steps in the process of going from out-sourcing to offshoring of the Viking call center in Alicante, Spain. The premises in Alicante was ready for operations to start 1 July and selected employees were transferred from previous outsourcing partner.
In June, Viking took the first steps of a soft entrance into Finland with the establishing of Viking Assistance Oy, a local office and the strategic agreement with Inter-Hinaus as our first franchise station located in the Helsinki area. Inter-Hinaus performs approx. 12.000 assistances a year and will shortly re-brand their vehicles to represent Viking.
We were pleased to receive a prolongation of the Scandinavian roadside assistance contract with the leading Nordic insurance company Tryg in June. The prolongation is a sign of the quality and competitiveness delivered by Viking as a pan-Nordic supplier. Work is ongoing to further strengthening the relationship through product development and integrated services.
During the quarter Viking was further awarded the pan-Nordic contract for PostNord. The contract strategically strengthens the groups pan-Nordic delivery capacities and presence. Although Viking already deliver services to PostNord in Sweden and Norway, the contract is important for all geographic areas and will add revenues in Denmark at satisfactory margins.

Personnel and organization
At the end of the period, the number of employees amounted to 197. Including external resources, such as dedicated people with contract suppliers and subcontractors, the Group employed ~260 people. Investments
The Group's acquisition of intangible assets during the second quarter amounted to MNOK 1.4. Investments in tangible assets during the quarter amounted to MNOK 0.6. The investments are mainly related to development of the ERP system VIS and net investments in rescue vehicles in subsidiaries. Net financial investments for the second quarter amounted to MNOK 2 and 1H17 MNOK 3,2.
EBITDA
Non-recurring and other non-operational items identified during the second quarter amounted to MNOK 2.6. Non-recurring items are mainly related to extraordinary costs related to the refinancing of the company, insourcing and establishment of Viking call center in Spain and Viking Finland.
