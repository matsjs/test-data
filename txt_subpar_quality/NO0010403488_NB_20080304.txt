To the bondholders in:

Viking Drilling ASA Second Priority Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012 with ISIN NO 001 040348.8 (the "NOK Tranche") and NO 001 040349.6 (the "USD Tranche")

Oslo, 4 March 2008

Partial repayment - Viking Drilling second lien bond issue due 2012

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NT") is appointed as loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the above mentioned bond issue (the "Loan") where Viking Drilling ASA is the issuer (the "Company").

All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the loan agreement dated 17 December 2007 (the "Loan Agreement"), unless otherwise stated.

We refer to our notice of 28 February 2008 in which we informed that funds from enforcement of the Escrow Account will be distributed to the Bondholders.

The funds of the Escrow Account do not cover the entire Loan including interest and expenses. Accordingly, the Bondholders will have an uncovered claim against the company. Furthermore, in the event that the Company will not be able to cover NT costs as of today and in the process going forward to recover the uncovered part of the Loan, a part of the appropriated funds (approx. 1.5 %) will be retained as security for NT costs. Any surplus of the retained funds and any additionally recovery of the Loan will be distributed later.

Pursuant to Loan Agreement, the Loan became due at 107 % of par plus accrued interest. As of 26 February 2008, the aggregate claim was (the USD equivalents are calculated based on exchange rate of 5.3009):
