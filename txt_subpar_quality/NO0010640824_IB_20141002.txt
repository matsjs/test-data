Dear Sirs

13.00 PER CENT OSX 3 LEASING B.V. SENIOR SECURED CALLABLE BOND ISSUE 2012/2015

1.

Interpretation

1.1 We refer to the bond agreement (the "Original Bond Agreement") originally dated 15 March 2012 and made between (i) OSX 3 Leasing B.V. (the "Issuer") and (ii) Nordic Trustee ASA (formerly Norsk Tlllitsmann ASA) (the "Bond Trustee") on behalf of the Bondholders (as defined therein) as amended and restated pursuant to an amendment and restatement agreement dated 12 September 2014 between (i) the Issuer; (ii) OSX Brasil S.A. - Em Recuperagao Judicial (the "Ultimate Parent") and (iii) the Bond Trustee (the Original Bond Agreement so amended and restated is referred to as the "Bond Agreement").

1.2 Words and expressions defined in the Bond Agreement shall have the same meaning in this letter, unless otherwise defined herein. References in this letter to a "Clause" is, unless the context otherwise requires, a reference to a clause in the Bond Agreement.

2.

Notification

2.1 Pursuant to Clause 15.1(m) (Insurances) of the Bond Agreement the Issuer is required to provide evidence to the Bond Trustee as at today's date that sufficient funds are in an escrow account to pay all premia that are due and payable on Insurances between 1 October 2014 and the Maturity Date.

2.2 Due to the fact that the restructuring of the Ultimate Parent is ongoing in
Brazil, it has not been possible for funds to be downstreamed to the Issuer in order for it to satisfy its obligation under Clause 15.1(m) (Insurances) of the Bond Agreement.

2.4 In accordance with Clause 13.2.1(a) {Information Covenants), we hereby notify the Bond Trustee that an Event of Default has occurred under Clause 15.1(m) {Insurances) of the Bond Agreement.
