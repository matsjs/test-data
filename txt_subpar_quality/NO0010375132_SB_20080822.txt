To the bondholders in:
ISIN: NO 001 037513.2 -FRN Africa Offshore Services AS Callable Bond Issue 2007/2012
Oslo, 22. august 2008
Amendment of Loan Agreement - Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as Loan Trustee for the above mentioned Loan where Marine Subsea AS ("MSA"), is the Borrower.
All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the agreements of the Loan (the "Loan Agreements") or the summons to this Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise stated.
The Loan is a floating rate bond issue. The Loan is i.a. encumbranced by first lien over the vessel Karianne ("Karianne") (currently under construction at Ulstein). The amount outstanding is USD 170 million, which will be reduced with USD 34 million in connection with the mandatory redemption 3 September 2008.
MSA, through its subsidiary Marine Subsea Karianne Ltd., ("MSK") believes that it should be possible to win a contract with Sonangol Pesquisa & Producao S.A., ("Sonangol") for Karianne in the near future.
The goal would be to secure a contract structure for Karianne similar to the contract received for the vessel Sarah (10 year "backstop" contract ensuring a guaranteed minimum day rate for 250 days in a year).
To secure such a contract, Sonangol would have to receive 25 % of the shares in MSK as they did in connection with the vessel Sarah. MSK's share capital is USD 2,514, and total shareholders' equity in the end of June is USD -9,584,314. The Karianne construction contract (approx. USD 175 mill.) is/will be financed by interest bearing inter-company loans from MSA and external debt.
In accordance with clause 10.3 in Loan Agreement a sale o f 25 % of the share capital with book value of USD 628 will trigger mandatory redemption o f the remaining loan amount at 107%.

MSA therefore consequently asks for the bondholders acceptance to amend clause 10.3 B.2 of the Loan Agreement from "if any of the Borrower's share in the Vessel Subsidiary are sold or disposed of or the Borrower's ownership in the Vessel Subsidiary otherwise is diluted; " to "if more than 25 % of the Borrower's share in the Vessel Subsidiary are sold or disposed of or the Borrower's ownership in the Vessel Subsidiary otherwise is diluted by more than 25 %; Further, this will imply that the Share Pledge over MSK will be reduced from 100% to 75% of the shares issued by MSK. (Collectively the "Proposed Amendment").

By agreeing to the Proposed Amendment, the bondholders will:

1. Still keep the pledge in the vessel 2. Secure the asset a guaranteed long term contract 3. Enable MSK to work towards a future sale and leaseback contract for Karianne. If
successful, this would trigger a mandatory redemption of the remaining Loan at 107%.

To enable the Issuer to conduct the proposed change of the Loan Agreement, MSA has requested the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to consider the approval of the Proposed Amendments.

The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.

B) "Subject to a contractfor the vessel "Karianne " is entered into with Sonangol Besquisa & Producao S.A on terms mainly equal to the contract receivedfor the vessel "Sarah ", the Share Pledge over the Vessel Subsidiary shall be limited to 75%>o f the shares issued by the Vessel Subsidiary. "
To approve the above resolution, Bondholders representing at least 2/3 o f the Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the meeting must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to have a quorum, at least 5/10 of the voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting. If the proposal is not adopted, the Bond Agreement will remain unchanged.
Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership o f the Bonds and o f the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.)
The individual Bondholder may authorise the Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Norsk Tillitsmann to vote, must then be returned to Norsk Tillitsmann in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
