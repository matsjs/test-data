SCHEDULE TO THE FINAL TERMS
CERTAIN INFORMATION REGARDING THE LOANS
The statistical and other information contained in these Final Terms has been compiled by reference to the Loans in the Portfolio as at 31 December 2010 (the Cut-off Date). Except as otherwise indicated, these tables have been prepared using the Current Balance as at the Cut-off Date, which includes all principal and accrued interest for the Loans in the Portfolio as at the Cut-off Date and may no longer be a true reflection o f the Portfolio. The following information does not include any New Loans sold into the Portfolio since the Cut-off Date, including any sale in connection with this Series 2011-4 issuance and it does not reflect any redemption or sales out of the Portfolio since the Cut-off Date.
The characteristics of the Portfolio as at the relevant Issue Date are not expected to differ materially from the characteristics o f the Portfolio as at the Cut-off Date, however, it should be noted that Loans may be removed from the Portfolio in the event that any such Loans are repaid in full or do not comply with the terms of the Mortgage Sale Agreement on or about the relevant Sale Date. The Seller may also choose, in certain circumstances, to repurchase any of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Mortgage Sale Agreement. Additionally, New Loans may be sold into the Portfolio from time to time. Any such sales will be made in accordance with the Mortgage Sale Agreement and subject to compliance with the Eligibility Criteria. This information is provided for information purposes only.
The tables below show details o f the Loans included in the Portfolio as at the Cut-off Date, and stratify the Portfolio by reference to either Mortgage Account or Loan as appropriate. A Mortgage Account represents the total of all Loans secured on a single property. Columns may not add up to the relevant total due to rounding.

* Arrears are calculated in accordance with standard market practice in the UK. A mortgage account is identified as being in arrears when, on any due date, the overdue amounts which were due on previous due dates equal, in the aggregate, one or more lull monthly payments. In making an arrears determination, the Servicer calculates as of the date of determination the difference between the sum of all monthly payments that were due and payable by a Borrower on any due date up to that date of determination (less the aggregate amount of all authorised underpayments made by such Borrower up to such date of determination) and the sum of all payments actually made by that Borrower up to that date of determination. If the result arrived at by dividing that difference (if any) by the amount of the required current monthly payment equals or exceeds 1 the Mortgage Account is deemed to be in arrears. Arrears classification is determined based on the number of equivalent full current monthly payments that have been missed. A Borrower that has missed payments that in the aggregate are equal to or exceed 2 monthly payments (but for which the aggregate of missed payments is less than 3 monthly payments) would be classified as being between 2 - 3 months in arrears, and so on.
