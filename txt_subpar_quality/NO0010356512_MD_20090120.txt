To the bondholders in:
FRN Aker American Shipping ASA Senior Unsecured Callable PIK Bond Issue 2007/2012 ISIN NO 001 035651.2
Oslo, 20 January 2009
CANCELLATION / POSTPONEMENT OF BONDHOLDERS MEETING
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the bond issue with ISIN N0001035651.2 (the "Loan") where American Shipping Company ASA (the "Borrower") is the issuer. (Prior to 21 July 2008 the registered name of the Borrower was Aker American Shipping ASA).
Reference is made to the summons dated 15 January 2009 for a Bondholders Meeting in the Loan to be held on 23 January 2009 at 11:00 hours (Oslo time).
The Borrower has approached the Loan Trustee to inform that they wish to postpone the date of the Bondholders' Meeting, and has therefore formally withdrawn the distributed summons. Consequently the Bondholders Meeting will not be held as scheduled.
According to the Borrower, a new date for the Bondholders' Meeting has not yet been determined but will be communicated to the Bondholders through a new summons.
