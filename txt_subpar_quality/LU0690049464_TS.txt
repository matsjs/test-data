Nykredit

и serial loans, и serial loans with optional interest-only
periods, и agreed with borrowers, or и a combination thereof.
Lending may be in the form of bond or cash loans and of maturities up to 35 years.
Issuance, maturity and opening period of the bonds
5
The bonds are issued in connection with the granting of loans, but may also be issued as a block issue or in connection with the conclusion of fixed-price agreements with borrowers.
The issuance of bonds has commenced with a view to funding loans disbursed from 29 August 2011 at the earliest.

All payments on the bonds including interest, principal payments and prepayment amounts in full discharge must be made exclusively in the currency denomination. The bonds and thus also the currency of the bonds as well as all payments hereunder shall at any time be governed by the rules provided by the EU as well as Danish legis lation. Such regulation may affect the bonds and their relationship with other currencies.
Coupon
7
The coupon rate is adjusted regularly at fixed intervals (interest rate fixing frequency).
The coupon rate is fixed for a period (fixing pe riod) in accordance with a specific method (fixing method) based on a recognised quoted or calcu lated interest rate index (reference rate).

The bonds may be issued with maturities of up to 35 years.
The maturity date of the bonds and the date of the latest closing for issuance (closing date) of an ISIN will be fixed upon commencement of the issuance of bonds of the same ISIN.
The period from commencement of issuance of bonds (opening date) until the closing for issu ance (closing date) of the same ISIN constitutes the maximum opening period of the ISIN con cerned.
However, during the opening period of an ISIN, Nykredit may decide to close the ISIN for issu ance of bonds and/or bring forward the closing date.
Currency
6
Bonds of the same ISIN may be denominated in one of the following currencies:и

A fixing period begins on the first calendar day of a given month, and the coupon rate fixed shall subsequently apply for a period corresponding to the interest rate fixing frequency.
On opening an ISIN, Nykredit may decide to let the fixing periods start on a day other than the first calendar day of a given month.
The coupon rates of bonds of the same ISIN may be adjusted on the basis of one of the following reference rates:
и CIBOR; The 1-, 3-, 6- or 12-month Copenhagen Interbank Offered Rate (Cibor) quoted daily by NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen A/S.
In the event NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen A/S ceases quoting the above-mentioned Cibor or if Cibor, in Nykredit's opinion, no longer reflects the Danish money market, Nykredit may calculate the coupon rate on the basis of market conform 1-, 3-, 6or 12-month money market rates.

и Danish kroner (DKK) и Euro (EUR) и Swedish kroner (SEK).

и EURIBOR; The 1-, 3-, 6- or 12-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) quoted daily

by the European Banking Federation (FBE) and the Financial Markets Associa tion (ACI) - with Reuters as the current calculation agent.
In the event Reuters (or the calculation agent that may succeed Reuters) ceases quoting the above-mentioned Euribor or if Euribor, in Nykredit's opinion, no longer reflects the European money market, Nykredit may calculate the coupon rate on the basis of market conform 1-, 3-, 6or 12-month money market rates.
и STIBOR; The 1-, 3-, 6- or 12-month Stockholm In terbank Offered Rate (Stibor) quoted daily by Sveriges Riksbank.

new fixing period, and the sum is multi plied by 365/360 (coupon rate = 365/360*(reference rate + spread)). The spread may be negative. The coupon rate calculated accordingly shall be the cou pon rate for the subsequent fixing period, but cf below on the opening of an ISIN.
и Sixth last banking day; The coupon rate is calculated as follows (fixing method): A spread is added to the reference rate quoted on the sixth last banking day before the beginning of a new fixing period. The spread may be negative. The coupon rate calculated ac cordingly shall be the coupon rate for the subsequent fixing period, but cf below on the opening of an ISIN.

In the event Sveriges Riksbank ceases quoting the above-mentioned Stibor or if Stibor, in Nykredit's opinion, no longer reflects the Swedish money market, Nyk redit may calculate the coupon rate on the basis of market conform 1-, 3-, 6- or 12-month money market rates.
The coupon rates of bonds of the same ISIN may be adjusted according to one of the following fixing methods:
и 5-day average (adjusted); The coupon rate is calculated as follows (fixing method): A simple average is cal culated of the reference rate quoted in the last five banking days up to and in cluding the fourth last banking day before the start of a new fixing period. A spread is added to the reference rate average, and the sum is multiplied by 365/360 (coupon rate = 365/360*(reference rate average + spread)). The spread may be negative. The coupon rate calculated ac cordingly shall be the coupon rate for the subsequent fixing period, but cf below on the opening of an ISIN.и
и Fifth last banking day (adjusted); The coupon rate is calculated as follows (fixing method): A spread is added to the reference rate quoted on the fifth last banking day before the beginning of a

и Third last banking day; The coupon rate is calculated as follows (fixing method): A spread is added to the reference rate quoted on the third last banking day before the beginning of a new fixing period. The spread may be negative. The coupon rate calculated ac cordingly shall be the coupon rate for the subsequent fixing period, but cf below on the opening of an ISIN.
Banking days are defined under item 17.
In connection with the opening of an ISIN, Nyk redit fixes the coupon rate for the period up to the first interest rate adjustment and the size of the interest rate spread, if any, applicable throughout the maturity of the bond.
Nykredit may furthermore fix one or more inter est rate caps and/or floors, which will be applica ble for part of or throughout the maturity of the bond. On adjustment, the coupon rate may not exceed the interest rate cap or fall below the interest rate floor, if any.
In the event the bond coupon rate should be come negative during an interest period, Nykredit may offset the negative interest amount against balances in favour of bond investors. This may take place by set-off against redemption amounts or by writing down bond investors' nominal bond holdings. If the negative interest amount exceeds

Nykredit

the redemption amount, Nykredit may opt to make further a redemption and set-off corres ponding to the remaining negative interest amount. Nykredit reserves the right to collect negative interest from bond investors in other ways. Bond investors will be informed of any collection of negative interest amounts.
Amortisation
8
Bonds of the same ISIN are amortised concur rently with the ordinary amortisation of the loans funded by the bonds. This also applies to the bonds of a block issue or the bonds issued in connection with the conclusion of fixed-price agreements with borrowers.
Where the prepayment of loans is not counter balanced by the drawing or cancellation of bonds, amortisation will remain unchanged as if the loans were repaid on an ordinary basis until the bonds are drawn or cancelled.
The bonds are callable.
The bonds are amortised by redemption at par by drawing following ordinary repayments on lend ing.
Extraordinary repayment (prepayment) of loans may take place either
и by a delivery of bonds of the same ISIN as the bonds issued to fund the loan, or
и by cash payment of the amount required to draw and redeem the bonds at a pre fixed price (redemption price), or
и by cash payment of the amount de manded by Nykredit or a credit institution forming part of the Nykredit Group in connection with immediate prepayment.
In connection with the opening of an ISIN, Nyk redit fixes the redemption price at which the bonds may be redeemed as a result of prepay ment of loans. The redemption price shall apply throughout the maturity of the bonds.
Drawing of bonds as a result of prepayment may consequently only take place at the pre-fixed redemption price of the ISIN concerned immedi

ately or later. The drawing of bonds as a result of ordinary repayments and prepayments will, how ever, take place collectively and at a weighted average price in a price range between par (100) and the redemption price fixed.
Amounts drawn will be disbursed on the coupon payment dates.
Payment dates
9
Bonds of the same ISIN may have 12, 4, 2, 1 or another number of annual payment dates.
The coupon is paid on a proportionate basis on each payment date according to a specified con vention (day count convention).
Bonds of the same ISIN pay coupon on each payment date according to one of the following day count conventions:
и Actual/actual (fixed fraction); The coupon is paid on a proportionate basis on each payment date according to the number of annual payment dates, ie the coupon payment on each payment date corresponds to the coupon interest divided by the annual number of payment dates.
и Actual/360; The coupon is paid on each payment date according to the actual number of days in the payment period relative to 360 days, ie the coupon payment on each payment date corresponds to the coupon interest multiplied by the actual number of days in the payment period divided by 360.
Coupon payments fall due on the first calendar day of a given month following the end of a pay ment period. At the opening of new ISINs, Nyk redit may fix due dates other than the first cal endar day of a given month.
Addition and accrual of interest may be adjusted as a result of changes in market conventions.
