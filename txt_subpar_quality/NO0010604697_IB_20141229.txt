Cancelation of Bondholders Meeting.
Reference is made to our announcement of 12 December 2014 regarding a summons to a bondholders' meeting in the bond loan with ISIN NO 001 0604697 regarding a request for an extension of maturity of that bond loan. Reference is furthermore made to the announcement later the same day regarding the petition for a Debt Restructuring Agreement (in Norwegian: gjeldsforhandling).
Please take note that, due to the process regarding the Debt Restructuring Agreement, Cecon ASA has decided to withdraw it summons for a bondholders' meeting in ISIN NO 001 0604697. The relevant bondholders will be approached with a suggested solution for the relevant bond loan when we know the outcome of the process for a Debt Restructuring Agreement.
