CEO's sta te m en t
The main highlights from the second quarter 2016 were a continued strong sales momentum in Norway, strengthening of the balance sheet through a successful private placement, the start of the migration to ice.net's own mobile phone network, and sustained improved results in our Swedish operation.
As mentioned in the Q1 2016 report, ice.net's gross subscriber sales in Norway (mobile phone and mobile broadband) totalled more than 50,000 in April and May alone. We are very pleased that the sales rate has been maintained at very favourable levels throughout the entire summer period and into August.
Growing at the rapid speed we have done in Norway does not come free. Hence, a private placement was successfully completed in June with the objective of raising proceeds to fund higher customer acquisition in Norway than previously anticipated and higher investments in sites and IT-systems in order to have more on net traffic and enable disruptive offerings. AINMT AS completed the NOK 429 million private placement and subsequently subscribed shares in AINMT Holdings AB, which in turn has granted a subordinated shareholder loan to AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS. The shareholder loan has a cap of NOK 450 million with an initial disbursement of NOK 200 million. This gives our Norwegian operation added financial flexibility going forward, and will enable it to continue on its current growth path.
In late June, only one year after we launched our consumer smartphone proposition in Norway, we started the process of migrating our smartphone customers from Telia's network across to ice.net's own 4G-only network. As expected, this has been a technical and operational challenge for our Norwegian operation, but each task has been solved with highly satisfactory results. A continuing strong customer intake in both existing and new sales channels throughout the summer, in addition to high volumes of customer being migrated to our new platform, has led to longer waiting time than normal at customer care. Churn increased somewhat in July, but still within industry average. The migration process as now been finalised for our consumer customers which will improve the situation greatly.
In Sweden, Net1 continues to deliver improved performance. We expect the solid profitability level to continue in the coming quarters.
