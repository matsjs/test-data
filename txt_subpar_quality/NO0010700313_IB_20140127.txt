Dannemora Magnetit AB Super Senior Secured Bond Issue due 19 February 2014

Oslo, 27 January 2014
Notification of Bondholder support for approval of the next draw down from the Escrow Account
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned issue with ISIN NO 001 070031.3 (the "Bonds") issued by Dannemora Magnetit AB (the "Company").
Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the bond agreement dated 7 January 2014 (the "Bond Agreement").
On 24 January 2014, NTM posted to the Bondholders the Notice entitled "Notification o f an Event o f Default as a result o f a failure to satisfy a Milestone Condition", which described that the Milestone Condition referred to in sub-paragraph (a) of that definition had not been satisfied by its due date and that, consequently, an Event of Default had arisen under clause 18.5 of the Bond Agreement. The notice further described that, as a result of the occurrence of the Event of Default, NTM had become entitled, in accordance with clause 7.2 of the Bond Agreement, to block further drawdowns by the Company from the Escrow Account.
NTM hereby notifies Bondholders that it has received directions from the largest Bondholders (who together hold more than 66 2A% o f the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Bonds) to permit the next drawdown from the Escrow Account, which is scheduled to occur on 27 January 2014, notwithstanding the subsistence of the Event of Default. On the basis of these directions, NTM intends, subject to the satisfaction of the remaining Drawdown Conditions described in clause 7.2(a), (b) and (c) of the Bond Agreement, to permit that drawdown.
