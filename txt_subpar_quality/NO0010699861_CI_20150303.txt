Notes to the condensed interim financial statements
Note 1 General information
The North Alliance AS is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Norway with offices at Kristian IV's gate in Oslo.
The company has during 2014 acquired several companies with the purchase date 23. January 2014. These acquisitions are consolidated from and including, 23. January 2014. The figures in the statements have not been audited. All amounts in the interim financial statements are presented in NOK 1.000 unless otherwise stated.
Note 2 Basis of preparation
These condensed interim financial statements for 2014 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, 'Interim financial reporting'. The condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 of NoA AS and condensed interim financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2014 and period ended 30 September 2014 of NoA AS, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union ('IFRS').
Note 3 Accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 and condensed interim financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2014 and period ended 30 September 2014.
Note 4 Estimates, judgments and assumptions
The preparation of interim financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In preparing these condensed interim financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 and condensed interim financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2014 and period ended 30 September 2014.
Note 5 Operating segments
The Board of Directors is the group's chief operating decision-maker. Management has determined the operating segments based on the information reviewed by the Board of Directors for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance.
The Board of Directors considers the business from a geographic perspective. This is the performance of the segment Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Holding companies are included as they are administrative centers.

Note 6 Seasonality Historically we have seen a higher activity level in 3rd tertial than in the 1st and 2nd tertial. The main factors explaining this are a high number of marketing campaigns ran by our clients in 3rd tertial and the fact that the period has more hours available for client deliveries due to vacation and holidays.
Note 7 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares purchased by the company and held as treasury shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Footnotes/Definitions Non ­ GAAP Measures Certain financial measures related thereto in this interim report, such as gross profit and EBITDA (collectively, the "Non-GAAP Measures"), are not specifically defined under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. These measures are presented in this quarterly report because they are among the measures used by management to evaluate the cash available to fund ongoing, long-term obligations and they are frequently used by other interested parties for valuation purposes or as a common measure of the ability of a company to incur and meet debt service obligations. These measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as alternatives to profit for the year, total operating revenues, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS, and they may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies.
EBITDA Our EBITDA represents operating income plus depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA Our Adjusted EBITDA represents operating income plus depreciation adjusted for one-off costs. Gross profit Gross profit represents revenue less cost of sales. Net interest bearing debt: Debt and assets subject to interest Leverage ratio: Net interest bearing debt to EBITDA Leverage ratio: EBITDA to Net Interest Expanse Operational costs: Costs included in in the operating profit.
