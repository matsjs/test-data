Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as Bond Trustee for the above mentioned Bond issue. The information in this summons regarding background, the Issuer and market conditions are provided by the Issuer, and the Bond Trustee expressly disclaims all liability whatsoever related to such information.
1. BACKGROUND Reference is made to the bond agreement dated 25 June 2013 (the "Bond Agreement"). GasLog Ltd. (the "Company" or "GasLog") realised after closing of the transaction that one of GasLog's banking covenants have not been reflected accurately in the Bond Agreement and hence is not accurately aligned with the corresponding financial covenants in GasLog's facility agreements. Clause 13.5 (i) of the Bond Agreement reads as follows:" EBITDA to Debt Service: The Issuer shall maintain the ratio of EBITDA to Debt Service, on a trailing four quarter basis, of minimum 1.10:1". For this clause to reflect the financial covenants in GasLog's facility agreement it should have been stated that this covenant would not apply until 31 December 2013. For the avoidance of doubt, this means that the first four quarters to be measured are Q1 2013 - Q4 2013. As GasLog is a rapidly growing company it is very important for GasLog that the EBITDA to Debt Service covenant does not apply until 31 December 2013. Based hereon all of GasLog's lending banks have agreed to not apply this covenant until this point in time. It should be noted that on pages 20, 66 and F-26 of the 2012 Annual Report on Form 20F issued by GasLog on 28 March 2013, which was included in the material furnished to all investors, it is clearly stated that this covenant does not apply until 31 December 2013. Further, it was stated at the investor meetings and marketing presentations with potential investors that the bond covenants would exactly mirror the corresponding banking covenants.
2. PROPOSAL Based on the background information set out above GasLog proposes to adjust clause 13.5 (i), with effect from 27 June 2013, to read as follows: "EBITDA to Debt Service: The Issuer shall maintain the ratio o fEBITDA to Debt Service, on a trailingfour quarter basis, o f minimum 1.10:1 which shall apply from 31 December 2013."

NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE

To enable the Issuer to conduct the proposed change of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer has requested the Bond Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to consider the approval of the proposed changes.

The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Bond Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.

Bondholders' meeting:

Bondholders are hereby summoned to a Bondholders' meeting:

Time: Place:

16 August 2013 at 13:00 hours (Oslo time), The premises of Norsk Tillitsmann ASA, Haakon VIIs gt 1, 01061 Oslo - 5thfloor

Agenda:

1. Approval of the summons. 2. Approval of the agenda. 3. Election of two persons to co-sign the minutes together with the chairman. 4. Request for adoption of proposal:

It is proposed that the Bondholders' meeting resolve the following:

Clause 13.5 (i) shall be amended with effect from 27 June 2013 to read as follows:

"EBITDA to Debt Service: The Issuer shall maintain the ratio to Debt Service, on a trailingfour quarter basis, o f minimum 1.10:1 which shall avvlv from 31 December 2013."

To approve the above resolution, Bondholders representing at least 2/3 of the Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the meeting must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to have a quorum, at least 1/2 of the voting Bonds must be represented at the meeting. If the proposal is not adopted, the Bond Agreement will remain unchanged.

Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.)

The individual bondholder may authorise the Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Norsk Tillitsmann to vote, must then be returned to Norsk Tillitsmann in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details).

In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
