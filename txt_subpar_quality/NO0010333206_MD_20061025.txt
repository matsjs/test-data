To the bondholders in:
ISIN NO 001 033320.6 - FRN Oceanteam Power & Umbilical AS Callable Bond Issue 2006/2010
Oslo, 25 October 2006
Mandatory Redemption - partially early redemption
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as loan truste for the above-captioned loan (the "Loan") where Oceanteam Power & Umbilical ASA ("Oceanteam") is the borrower. The current outstanding amount of the Loan is NOK 420 million. The net proceeds of the Loan should be used for financing the construction of the vessel "North Ocean 103" and the purchase of the vessel "CLV Skagerrak". The said vessels should also, directly or indirectly, be the securities of the Loan. For more details, please see the loan agreement of the Loan (the "Loan Agreement"). Unfortunately, Oceanteam did not acquire the vessel "CLV Skagerrak". Therefore, pursuant to clause 10.4 of the Loan Agreement, Oceanteam will make an early redemption of NOK 50 million of the Loan on 6 December 2006 at 102 % of par plus accrued, but not paid interest.
For the avoidance of doubt, after the said partially early redemption, the remaining amount of Loan will not be secured by any of the security related (directly or indirectly) to the vessel "CLV Skagerrak".
Kind regards Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
Ola Nygård
