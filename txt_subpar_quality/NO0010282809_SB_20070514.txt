To the bondholders in:

ISIN: NO 001 028280.9 - 9.00 per cent Songa Offshore ASA Bond Issue 2005/2010

Oslo, 14 May 2007
REQUEST FOR CONSENT TO EARLY REDEMPTION - Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") is appointed as Loan Trustee for the above mentioned Bond issue (the "Loan") where Songa Offshore ASA (the "Company") is the Borrower.
All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Loan Agreement unless otherwise stated.

The Company proposes an early redemption of the entire Loan on 8 June 2007 at a price of 105.75% of par plus accrued unpaid interest. The price corresponds to an asset swap spread of 188 basis points on 8 May 2007. The new Maturity Date is suggested to be 8 June 2007.

The background for the proposed early redemption, is the need in the Company's view to restructure its balance sheet. The Company has already announced that it has secured cummnmeni from four banks for a new USD 650 million facility. This will take out the current bank facilities, two commercial papers due late June, a convertible lease due end June, and potentially the 2010 9% bond issue.

Investors should note, that if the proposal is not approved, the banks have accepted to refinance a smaller amount, and the Company intends to leave the 2010 9% bond outstanding. If the proposal is not approved, the bond will mature as initially intended at 100% in 2010.

The Company has appointed ABG Sundal Collier (ABG) as the Company's advisor. Questions may be directed to Mr Mark Philip Gretton (ABG) at +47 2201 60 31, or to the Company - Mr Tom E. Jebsen, CFO, at +47 2301 1431 (w) / 90 747 997 (m).

To enable the Borrower to conduct the proposed change of the Loan Agreement, the Borrower has requested the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' meeting to consider the approval of the proposed changes.

The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.
