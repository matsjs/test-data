Presentation to Bondholders in the NOK 650 million bond issued by Solør Bioenergi Holding AS and the SEK 950 million bond issued by Solör Bioenergi Holding AB
June 18, 2015

Background
· Solör Bioenergi Holding AB (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (together the "Solør Group") have two bonds outstanding; the NOK 650 million bond issued by Solør Bioenergi Holding AS (the "NOK Bond") and the SEK 950 million bond issued by Solör Bioenergi Holding AB (the "SEK Bond")
· On 27 April 2015, Solør Group issued a press release in relation to recognition of income associated with excess values from acquisitions made by the Solør Group in 2014
· The press release was a result of extensive reviews by the Company's auditor who concluded that the acquisitions of Rindi Energi AB and the E.ON portfolio in 2014 did not qualify for recognition of excess values based on a "bargain purchase" approach under IFRS
· Consequently, the financial statements for 2014 for both Solør Bioenergi Holding AS and Solör Bioenergi Holding AB will be corrected and the income recognition of excess value amounting to SEK 891 million will be reversed
· This reversal requires an accounting process that will delay the publication of audited annual accounts for 2014 originally scheduled for 30 April 2015
· Following the above, the Solør Group is unable to comply with the financial covenants "Equity Ratio", "Current Ratio" and "Interest Coverage Ratio" as set out in the respective bond agreements
· The covenant breaches are only temporary, and relate mainly to accounting treatment, and will in the Company's opinion not affect Solør Group's underlying operations, cash flow, debt servicing ability, or credit quality going forward
· However, as the Solør Group are in breach of its obligations under both the NOK Bond and SEK Bond, the Company has proposed to the bondholders certain amendments and waivers as described in the summons letter and the written notice to bondholders dated 18 June 2015
· The Company has in the following presentation described in more detail the background for the proposal in addition to a general update of the Solør Group's operational and financial performance
