CEO's sta te m en t
The main highlights for the third quarter 2016 was continued solid sales figures for our Norwegian operation, migration of Norwegian smartphone customers across to our own 4G only network and IT platform, and strengthening of AINMT Scandinavia Holdings AS' balance sheet.
We're very pleased that ice.net's sales rate for mobile phone subscriptions has continued to be high throughout the third quarter. This demonstrates clearly that its mobile phone offering is proving highly popular amongst Norwegian consumers and businesses. The migration of consumer customers from Telia's network and IT platform across to ice.net was concluded in the quarter, as a result we plan on starting to generate smartphone on-net traffic from Q1 2017. The number of calls generated by the migration process in addition to the calls generated by new customers did result in longer than expected waiting time at customer care in July and August, but this is now back to industry leading standard. As mentioned in the Q2 report, this process expectedly increased churn, but still below industry average.
In August and September, B2B customers were migrated from Telia's to ice'net's network. As the B2B segment for obvious reasons is a more demanding customer group, churn increased to above industry average during and following the migration process.
Nevertheless, churn in both consumer and B2B segments have been offset by strong sales throughout the quarter. This is why we in August decided to provide our Norwegian operation with added financial flexibility through granting AINMT Scandinavian Holdings AS a shareholder loan from AINMT Holdings AB. The loan had a cap of NOK 450 million with an initial disbursement of NOK 200 million. The remaining 250 million was disbursed in September and the full loan was converted into equity on 30 September 2016.
In Sweden, Net1 has yet again delivered a quarter with solid financial performance with a record high yearto-date EBITDA of SEK 49 million.
