SUMMONS TO BONDHOLDERS' MEETING - CORRECTION
Reference is made to the summons to bondholders' meeting of 12 June 2009 (the "Summons"). Songa Offshore SE (formerly Songa Offshore ASA) (the "Borrower") has requested this correction notice to be posted in connection with the information provided to bondholders.
All capitalized terms used but not define herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Summons.
The information in this summons regarding the Borrower and market conditions are provided by the Borrower, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information.
The Forced Conversion Price has in the Summons been wrongly referred to as USD 3.175, while the correct conversion price shall be USD 4.6434. The correction does not have any impact on the result of the Forced Conversion as set out in the Summons, and each Bondholder will still receive 10,768 ordinary Shares for each Bond held.
Yours sincerely
