1st Quarter 2014 2
Management Summary
Strong first quarter revenue growth.
Kent Zehetner, CEO of StormGeo Group, stated; "Q1 2014 has been the most eventful quarter in StormGeo's history with the acquisition of Applied Weather Technology (AWT), placing NOK 500 million bond loan and getting EQT Mid Market on board as a partner for further growth. The acquisition of AWT propels StormGeo into a leading position within decision support for weather sensitive operations in the shipping and offshore industries. We are routing approx. 4000 voyages a month, roughly 2600 active voyages per day, and our software is installed on more than 5300 vessels. " To finance the acquisition of AWT, StormGeo successfully placed a NOK 500 million bond loan in February 2014 (3 year maturity) as well as raising NOK 143 million in new equity. In the following repair share issue in April 2014, an additional NOK 54 million was raised in new equity. Post transaction, the Group holds no other interest carrying debt, and approximately NOK 120 million in cash reserves. Given that more than 80% of revenues are generated in USD, the loan issued in NOK has been swapped to USD. In addition, Sparebank 1 SR-Bank increased our overdraft facility from NOK 15 million to NOK 50 million in February 2014, which is currently unused. In March 2014 EQT Mid Market fund acquired 57.5% of the outstanding shares in StormGeo Holding AS from Reiten & Co and TV2. In the same transaction, DNV GL increased their ownership to 27 % confirming their commitment in StormGeo. The chairman and management/staff hold respectively 4.5 % and 11 % of the shares. Kent Zehetner concluded; "I'm impressed by the organizations ability to keep focus on operations during the eventful period and securing strong organic growth in Q1 of 23% 1compared to Q1 2013."
1StormGeo acquired Applied Weather Technology Inc. in February 2014 and the proforma revenue figures are reported in Note 3 for YTD 2014 and YTD 2013. The positive currency effect vs same period last year is of approx. 8 % points.

Note 1 - Basis for preparation / Accounting Policies
Basis for preparation The interim financial statements for the first quarter 2014 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 "Interim Financial Reporting". The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statement of the financial year 2013, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year. The interims financial statements are unaudited.
The consolidated financial statements are based on historical cost, with the exception of financial instruments which are available for sale and recognized at fair value. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of uniform accounting principles for similar transactions and events under otherwise similar circumstances.
Functional currency and presentation currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in NOK. This is also the parent company's functional currency and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (NOK000), except when otherwise indicated. The statement of financial position figures of subsidiaries with a different functional currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period while the statement of comprehensive income figures are translated at the transaction exchange rate. The average exchange rates for the year are used as an approximation of the transaction exchange rate. If this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, income and expenses are translated at the transaction date exchange rates. Exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income ("OCI"). When investments in foreign subsidiaries are sold, the accumulated translation differences relating to the subsidiary attributable to the equity holders of the parent are recognised in profit or loss
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements show the total financial results and financial position of the parent company, StormGeo Holding AS, and its subsidiaries that are 100 per cent owned by StormGeo and are fully consolidated in the consolidated financial statement.
