Peru), which is the current level of permitted secured debt. viii. Restrict repayment of existing unsecured debt in the Issuer which is not a part of the
daily operation of the Company until the Bond Loan is repaid in full. ix. Amendment of the change of control clause to market standard so that any person or
group getting control over 50% or more of the outstanding shares of the Issuer will trigger a change of control. The carve-out for Marten Rod and Gian Angelo Perrucci will consequently be removed.

It is proposed that the Bondholders' Meeting under agenda item 4 resolve the following:
"The Bondholders' Meeting approve the Proposal as described in item 2 of the summons, and, consequently, the Bond Agreement shall be deemed amended as required to complete the amendments and all waivers necessary shall be deemed to have been given. The Bond Trustee is hereby authorised to complete the negotiation o fform, terms, conditions and timing in relation to the Proposal, without any obligation to notify the Bondholders as providedfor in Clause 16.2 o f the Bond Agreement. Further, the Bond Trustee is given power of attorney to enter into the necessary agreements in connection with documenting the decisions made by the Bondholders' Meetings as well as to carry out the necessary completion work, including making amendments to the Bond Agreement and enter into an addendum agreement to the Bond Agreement. "
To approve the above resolution, Bondholders representing at least 2/3 of the Bonds represented in person or by proxy at the meeting must vote in favour of the resolution. In order to have a quorum, at least 1/2 of the voting Bonds must be represented at the meetings.
Attached hereto is a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS) indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered.)
The individual bondholder may authorise the Bond Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising the Bond Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Bond Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to the Bond Trustee, to notify the Bond Trustee by telephone or by email (at set out at the first page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.

Exhibit 1: Background and Company Update
The Issuer is currently in a stressed financial situation and does not have sufficient funds to meet the next bond installment on 10 March 2013.
The Company has therefore initiated a process o f issuing between USD 35 and 50 million in equity (the "New Equity"). The New Equity issue will be contingent on amendment o f certain terms in the Loan Agreement. On this background the Issuer is hereby putting forward a proposal to the Bondholders to approve certain changes to the Loan Agreement conditional on a successful completion o f the equity issue.
As communicated to the market on 11 Februaiy 2013 the board of directors o f the Company is o f the opinion that the Company's only option in order to increase the value o f its assets in Colombia is to strengthen working capital and fund a drilling campaign that will grow production and reserves. The contingent resource base in Colombia is significant, and historic production data shows that there is a strong correlation between drilling activities and production growth. In the period from 2006 and to 2008 hiteroil invested on average USD 14.5 million per year in drilling activities on the Puli-C license which led to an increase in production o f over 1,600 bbl/day to a peak o f -1,800 bbl/day. Since 2009 Interoil's investments have been limited to an average o f USD 5 million per year which has resulted in a decline in production to the current level of less than 1,000 bbl/day. The production will continue to fall unless the Company invests in drilling o f new production wells.
Interoil's new board and management have implemented a strategy that will secure a significant increase of the value o f its assets in Colombia and Peru at low a low risk:
(i) Unnecessary overhead costs will be reduced by approximately USD 10 million per annum.
(ii) The organization will focus on achieving good corporate governance, accountability throughout the organization and transparent business conduct.
(iii) Increased focus on maintaining production in Peru at the lowest cost possible and securing a long-term license extension in Peru.
(iv) A solid financial platform that will enable the company to triple its production and substantially increase its reserves.
As consequence of the new strategy to use its financial resources to increase production hiteroil has developed a low-risk drilling program to drill 68 wells within the existing Puli-C production license. Interoil has produced from this license since 2005, and therefore has considerable historic data and experience from these reservoirs. The drilling program has already been initiated and Interoil expects to spud the first production well in April 2013. hiteroil expects this drilling program to yield an average daily production of 3,000 bbl/day by 2015 and substantially increase the Company's reserves.
Furthermore, Interoil has reduced its financial exposure in the exploration blocks Altair and Cor-6 through a sale o f these licenses to Trayectoria Oil and Gas for USD 2 million. This alleviates Interoil o f USD 26 million in exploration commitments. The sale o f the licenses is subject to ANH (government) approval, and the sale o f the Altair license will require the consent from the bondholders since the license is pledged on behalf o f the Bond Loan.
7

In addition, the Company has initiated an aggressive cost cutting program which entails a new and smaller senior management team, relocation to less costly offices in Oslo, divestment of Interoil's technical office in Zurich, cancellation o f all consultancy contracts with related parties and a liquidation and simplification of the corporate structure through a liquidation of dormant and/or insolvent subsidiaries. On aggregate these measures are expected to result in USD 10 million cost savings per annum, significantly improving the Company's profitability. The divestment o f Interoil's technical office in Zurich and the liquidation of (i) Interoil Latinamerica AS (dormant), (ii) Interoil Exploration SA (dormant), (iii) Interoil Exploration and Production Ghana AS (insolvent) and (iv) Interoil Exploration and Production Africa AS (insolvent) will require bondholders' acceptance. None o f these subsidiaries are presently carrying any value to the benefit o f the Issuer and its bondholders.

Interoil currently has USD 10 million in unsecured bank debt in Colombia. This is USD 5 million in excess of the unsecured debt covenant permitted under the current Bond Loan Agreement. This excess debt was incurred in order to refinance overdue tax debt with a substantially higher interest rate then the new loan. In order to become compliant with the bond covenants the Company proposes to simplify the covenants to replace the existing allowance for USD 5 + 5 million in unsecured debt and capital leases with one covenant that allows for USD 10 million o f accumulated unsecured debt and capital leases. The proposed changes will not entail that Interoil will be permitted to incur more unsecured debt commitments than what the Company can under the current terms of the Bond Loan Agreement.

furthermore, Interoil proposes to restrict the Issuer from making any repayment of existing unsecured debt which is not a part of daily operations o f the Company and which is ranking junior to the Bond Loan until final maturity. This will ensure that the Issuer is not repaying unsecured creditors before the Bond Loan is repaid in full which is to the benefit o f the bondholders.

Finally, In Peru Interoil will focus on maintaining production at the lowest cost possible and securing a long-term license extension for Block III and Block IV in Peru. The Company is optimistic towards securing these license extensions and notes the recent statement from Peru's Minister o f Energy and Mines where he states the intention to propose new regulation in Peru that will ensure continuity for the independent oil companies operating in Peru.

Interoil will use approximately half of the New Equity to improve working capital including interest on the Bond Loan and the remaining net proceeds on the new drilling program in Colombia.

Interoil believes the proposed refinancing and planned development program will be in the Bondholders' interest as it will greatly improve the Company's cash flow and reserves in Colombia.

5.2

March 2012 Bond Loan Amortization

The major short- and medium-term liability o f the Company is the upcoming March 2013 amortization as well as the final maturity in March 2014 on the Bond Loan. It is a prerequisite for the New Equity investors that the Bondholders accept an extension o f the Bond Loan's maturity.

From today and until 2015 the Company will invest USD 70 million in new production wells. The revenues from this production will significantly improve the Company's cash flow and ability to repay the Bond Loan while simultaneously increasing the value of the Colombian assets through the development of new reserves.

8

However, in order to achieve this production the Company needs to use its free cash flow to invest in new wells in the Puli-C license. The drilling program can therefore only be executed if the amortization of the Bond Loan is extended to 2016. The New Equity is being raised to finance the drilling program and it is therefore a prerequisite that the Bond Loan's maturity is extended to March 2016 in order to show the New Equity investors that Interoil has a robust financial platform and manageable liabilities until the new production level is established. No other economic terms in the Bond Loan are proposed altered through this proposal.

Puli C: Future Drilling and Development
 Interoil recognizes significant potential for future development and production within Puli C
> Within contract areas there are large proven but unexploited areas of hydrocarbon potential both at the shallow Doima level as well as the deep Monserrate level
> To develop those areas, Interoil will initiate a 68 well drilling program
 From 2013 through 2015 Interoil is targeting 68 wells followed by additional wells thereafter
> In total more than 120 well locations defined
 The current reserves only recognize a small part of the identified resources
> 1.8 MMbbl of 2C oil resources are classified as contingent due to lack of financing to drill wells > The planned 68 wells will target 5.1 MMbbl of which 0.9 MMbbl are 2P undeveloped + 1.8 MMbbl
2C only condition on funding and remaining 2.4 MMbbl 2C are other contingent resources
 In addition, Interoil has also identified material exploration upside in 3 prospect areas: Mana West (Monserrate), Ambrosia North and South (Doima)
13

Interoil will restart a large scale development program

 Interoil's new development program for 2013-15:
> 33 "deep" wells to target the `Monserrate' reservoirs > 35 "shallow" wells to target the Doima reservoirs > Simultaneous drilling with 2 rigs:
· 1 rig capable of drilling the `deep' Monserrate wells in Mana South and greater Rio Opia areas
· 1 lighter rig to drill the shallower Doima wells
 Most wells are up-dip of existing development, removing the risk for lack of hydrocarbon charge, hence the main risks are uncertainty regarding well productivity due to varying reservoir development (in light of historic well performance) as well as the potential risk of a gas cap being present in the Monserrate wells of Mana South
 Development program targets to lift Interoil's net production to 3,000 bbl/d from Colombia

Status of exploration blocks
 Interoil has signed a binding agreement to farm out the following interests in its Colombia exploration blocks following cancellation of the LOIs announced previously in 2012:
> Altair: Sell 100% by transfer of all commitments (gross USD 4m) > Cor-6: Sell 100% by transfer of all commitments (gross USD 22m) > USD 2m cash consideration to Interoil
 Transaction is subject to approval from local banks, bondholders and ANH
> Expected to be completed within July 2013
 Interoil continues to pursue farm-out alternatives for the LLA-47 exploration asset:
> High potential block in the Llanos Basin > 5 identified leads/prospects with net prospective resource potential of 14.1 MMbbl (100% WI after
royalty) > One existing discovery on the block (Lince)
 High exploration potential to be further defined through 2013 seismic acquisition
> Large part of the block to be covered by 3D seismic during 2013
 Drilling of prospects to commence immediately following seismic processing and interpretation
> Commitment to drill eight exploration wells by February 2015

Interoil in Peru: Highlights

 Interoil has been active in Peru since 2005

 Strong track record of production growth and cash flow generation

 2012 production of 3,000 bbl/day (before royalty)
> Stable production in Block IV @ 800 bbl/day > Production from Block III @ 2,200 bbl/day

 Licenses approaching expiry, but operations are extended according to an interim injunction award pending a Force Majeure ruling related to flooding of fields in connection with El Nino
> Block III temporarily extended to January 2016
> Block IV temporarily extended to October 2014

 Recent positive developments regarding long term license extension:

> Minister of Energy & Mines announced on 29th

January 2013 that he will implement regulations to

promote the continuity of, amongst others, Interoil's

concessions.
