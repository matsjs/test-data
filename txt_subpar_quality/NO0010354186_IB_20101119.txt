Information update II - Primorsk International Shipping Limited
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as Bond Trustee for the above mentioned bond issue with ISIN N0001035418.6 (the "NOK Tranche") and ISIN N0001035420.2 (the " USD Tranche") where Primorsk International Shipping Limited is the Borrower (the "Borrower" or the "Company"). Jointly the two tranches are referred to as the "Loan". All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the agreement for the Loan (the "Loan Agreement").
Reference is made to the information updated published on stamdata.no on 10 June 2010. The ongoing senior secured bank debt restructuring (the "Bank Restructuring") has taken significantly longer time than expected and is still ongoing. The involved syndicate banks are targeting a final Bank Restructuring proposal by mid December 2010 and implementation of such proposal in January 2011. The Bank Restructuring will be contingent on an acceptable restructuring o f the Loan.
End September 2010, the Company provided the Bond Trustee with an operational and financial update, and informed that it intends to call for a bondholders' meeting mid December or early January, coherent with the final Bank Restructuring proposal reaching an agreed form. The Company has further informed the Bond Trustee that it intends to ask for an extended maturity date to match the restructured bank debt and will, as compensation, among others, offer the Bondholders an increased coupon margin. Further details will be disclosed in the summons to bondholders' meeting.
