COMMENTS TO THE Q1 2015 REPORT

The company
The North Alliance AS (NOA) is a group of companies offering services within marketing communication, design and technology. The family of companies operates in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Poland. A new advertising company, Acoustic Ltd., is also under establishment in Singapore.

The group was founded on January 23, 2014 when NOA acquired the following companies:

- Making Waves Group (NO, SE and PL) - Åkestam Holst Group
o Åkestam Holst (SE) o Bold (SE, DK) o StudioNOC (SE) o Promenad (SE) - Great Works (SE, DK) - AndCo (DK) - Anorak (NO) - Acoustic (Singapore, established in Jan. 2015)

Financials
Total net revenues for Q1 2015 were 128,1 MNOK, up 5,3% from Q1 2014. The growth in revenues comes largely from group-wide projects where NOA-companies have won significant multidiscipline projects across the Nordic region. The EBITDA for Q1 came in at 1,1 MNOK, compared to a proforma figure of 9,4 MNOK for Q1 2014. Profitability for the quarter, however, is in line with budget as a significant ramp-up has occurred across the group to allow for significant growth going forward.

On December 20, 2013 NOA entered into a Bond Agreement. The Bond issue was subsequently listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. NOA undertakes to comply with the certain financial covenants during the term of the Bond issue and after Q1 2015 the company is in compliance with all such covenants. Net debt/adjusted EBITDA was after Q1 2015 1,41x, EBITDA (adjusted)/net interest costs was 3,29x, and cash at hand was 78,2 MNOK.

Outlook
We expect the positive development of Q1 2015 to continue. The focus is now to utilize the NOA's Nordic digital capabilities as efficient as possible and be ready for further growth across the region.
