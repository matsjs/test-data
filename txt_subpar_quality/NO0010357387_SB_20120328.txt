Background
Please refer to the summons to Bondholders' Meeting dated 27 February 2012 for a Bondholders' Meeting on 5 March 2012. The proposal for changing the maturity date for the Residual Loans from 7 March 2012 to 9 April 2012 was approved.
The Company is currently in discussions with an ad hoc committee of Bondholders regarding a further extension of the maturity date of the Bonds to allow for a full exploration of the commercial value, if any, of the Nexus 2 construction contract option. The ad hoc committee of Bondholders, who collectively own a majority of each of the Bonds, are being represented by AMA Capital Partners and Bingham McCutchen (London) LLP in connection with any such proposal. In order to finalise this work, the Company now wishes to propose a further extension of the maturity date under each of the Loan Agreements. The new proposed maturity date for the Residual Loans is 31 May 2012.
