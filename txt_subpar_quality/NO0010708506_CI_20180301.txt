Q4 2017 Update from the board of directors

Financial performance Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its subsidiaries, hereafter "the Group", closed a quarter showing increased revenues driven by increased volumes. While the Group is still experiencing some market driven price pressure, the extent has lessened from previous quarters. As a result, revenues increased to USD 12,008 thousand in Q4 2017 in comparison to USD 11,685 thousand in Q4 2016.
Furthermore, the cost control measures continue to show effect resulting in a decrease of the operating expenses in Q4 in comparison to prior year. The expenses decreased to USD 8,334 thousand (Q4 2016: 8,432 thousand).

The operating cash flow in YTD Q4 2017 was USD 5,898 thousand positive, versus a positive cash flow of USD 3,518 YTD Q4 2016.
Organizational changes There are no significant organizational changes to report in Q4 2017.
Events after balance sheet date On 31 January 2018, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Transoil Laboratory Ltd based in Manchester, United Kingdom. Further reference is made to Note 10 of this interim financial report.

Explanatory notes to condensed consolidated interim financial statements

5. Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies applied in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the same as those applied in the Group's consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2016. The following new or amended standards, which became effective in 2017, do not have a significant impact on the Group's financial performance or disclosure:
· Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRS standards
· Amendments regarding the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses
The Group is assessing the potential impact on its financial performance or disclosure resulting from the future application of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16; the impact of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 (effective from financial year 2018) is expected to be limited. The impact of IFRS 16 (effective from financial year 2019) on the balance sheet and the income statement will be disclosed in more detail in the annual report of financial year 2018. The current expectation is that the EBITDA will be positively impacted and the annual result will be remain unchanged.

6. Operating segments
The Group considers its activities as one segment in relation to the disclosure requirements of IFRS 8 Segment reporting.
7. Tax Expense
Tax expense is recognised based on management's best estimate of the weighted-average annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year multiplied by the pre-tax income of the interim reporting period. The Group's consolidated average tax rate is in respect of continuing operations for the twelve months ended 31 December 2017 22% (twelve months ended 31 December 2016: 22%).
8. Loan Covenants
The Group needs to be compliant with the stipulations in the loan covenant requirements of the bond agreement. As per 31 December 2017 the Group meets the requirements of the loan covenant as stipulated in the bond agreement.

9. Net finance costs

10. Subsequent events

The change in net finance costs during financial year 2017 in comparison to financial year 2016 is mainly caused by the borrowing structure of the Group and financial year closing adjustments. The increased net finance costs is caused by the increased interest for the shareholder loan and decreased currency exchange results. Furthermore, the other financial expenses increased in Q4 2017 in comparison to Q4 2016 with regards to the amortisation of the finance expenses regarding the bond amendment in 2017.

The net finance costs of the Group is as follows.
