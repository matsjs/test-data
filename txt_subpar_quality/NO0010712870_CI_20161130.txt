UPDATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2016
In the nine months ended 30 September 2016 the Company successfully delivered the last two phases (each 700m2 of white space) of the data centre to EVRY AS (i.e. on 1 January 2016 and 3 March 2016), approximately one month earlier than provided for in the Agreement with EVRY.
The Company and EVRY entered into an additional agreement in this period where the Company will be compensated, throughout the term of the existing 20-year contract, for undertaking additional construction and project management work. This construction work was finalised during the half year ended 30 June 2016. The additional construction work was funded by an additional shareholder loan.
For the nine months ended 30 September 2016, the Company's operating revenues totalled NOK 56.6 million, an increase of NOK 38.1 million over the same period last year due to the phased handover of each 700m2 totalling 4,200m2. Operating expenses totalled NOK 23.3 million, an increase of NOK 5.6 million over the same period last year, which comprised of NOK 22.0 million of operational, management and accounting support costs and NOK 1.3 million of personnel costs.
EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortisation) for the nine months ended 30 September 2016 was NOK 33.3 million, compared to NOK 0.8 million in the same period last year.
A charge of NOK 30.1 million was made to reflect depreciation of the building compared to NOK 11.2 million in the first nine months of 2015. Net finance costs of NOK 20.8 million are reflected in the Income Statement; compared to a negligible amount in the same period last year, as construction is now complete and the capitalisation of net finance costs thereby ceased from the date of final handover on 1 March 2016.
In light of the above, the loss before income tax for the nine months ended 30 September 2016 came in at NOK 17.6 million, a higher loss compared to the first nine months of 2015, of NOK 10.6 million. This was due to an increase in depreciation and in net finance costs.
Cash generated from operations was NOK 47.8 million in the first nine months of 2016, compared to NOK 21.6 million in the same period in 2015.
Total long term borrowings of NOK 494.4 million at 30 September 2016 reflect the Bond Issue completed in June 2014 and remain largely unchanged from the year end position. Shareholder loans, on the other hand, did not change in the third quarter of 2016.
At 30 September 2016 cash and cash equivalents stood at NOK 58.9 million compared to NOK 48.5 million at year end 2015.
