Q3 2016 Update from the board of directors

Financial performance
Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its subsidiaries, hereafter "the Group", faced a challenging quarter in comparison to prior year. The main driver for the lower performance is the price pressure. The testing volumes remained fairly stable where the quantity surveys are still showing solid growth. The expenses showed a decline versus the same quarter last year as a result of the continuous focus on cost improvements. The reported exceptional expenses are limited to 10% of adjusted EBITDA. However the Q3 actual exceptional expenses are amounting to USD 981 thousand and YTD Q3 USD 2,310 thousand (Q3 2015: 596 thousand; YTD Q3 2015: 1,421 thousand). The exceptional expenses include oa. the one off impact of the implementation of the cost reduction program.

mainly driven by the exceptional items and underlying by the decrease in revenues due to price pressure, offset by cost improvements.
The operating cash flow per YTD Q3 was USD 1,638 thousand negative. Corrected for actual exceptional expenses the cash flow amounts to USD 672 thousand positive (YTD Q3 2015: 3,860 positive), showing a decrease which is mainly as a result of decreased performance, Bond buy-back and temporary increased working capital.
Group Management expects in 2017 the full year impact of costs measures taken in 2016 and continues to focus on cost improvements in Q4 and in 2017. The Group is also actively pursuing a number of M&A targets to improve EBITDA and is continuously assessing its overall financing structure.

Adjusted for these one-off expenses, the Group's Q3 Adjusted EBITDA showed the figures in tabulated format (see next page).
The Group closed Q3 2016 performance with a net loss of USD 668 thousand (Q3 2015: net profit of USD 386 thousand) which is

Organizational changes Per 1 July Steve Bee started as Commercial Director and will focus on improving our top line performance.

Explanatory notes to condensed consolidated interim financial statements

1. Reporting entity
Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. is a company domiciled in The Netherlands. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as at and for the nine months ended 30 September 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The Group primarily provides testing and survey services to the Maritime industry.
2. Basis of accounting
This condensed consolidated interim financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim financial reporting. It does not include all the information required for a complete set of IFRS financials statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant for an understanding of the changes in the Group's financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2015.
This condensed consolidated interim financial statement was authorised for issue by the Company's Board of Management on 29 November 2016.

3. Use of judgments and estimates
In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant judgements made by management in applying the group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2015.
4. Restatement of 2015 quarterly reports
The results presented for the period ending 30 September 2015 are different from what was published last year. The 2015 quarterly results were prepared with the best knowledge available at that time but in the course of 2015 better insight has developed as a result of amongst others compliance with IFRS reporting and annual closing 2015. The 2015 quarterly results have been changed accordingly for comparison purposes. An overview of the differences is presented below.

The change in net finance costs is mainly caused by the borrowing structure of the Group, partly offset by an decrease of currency exchange results, amortised costs for the bond loan and gains resulted from the bond buy-back. Starting 2016 the interest income bond buy-back concerns the income in interest as result of the bond buy back in 2015 and Q1 2016. The net finance costs of the Group is as follows.
