4. CONDITION
The completion of the Proposal, as set out in clause 3 in this summons, (when adopted) is conditional upon the Guarantee being effective.

5. EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSAL
4.1 The Borrower's evaluation o f the Proposal
The board and management of Aker BioMarine ASA supports the proposal presented in the board meeting 9th March 2010 and outlined in the stock release 10th March 2010. By reaching an agreement with holders of the NOK 750 million bond loan, Aker BioMarine has moved one step further in the refinancing program the company announced on 8 February 2010

4.2 The Loan Trustee's evaluation to the Proposal
Based on the information given from the Company and its advisors, refinancing for of the existing debt is not a valid option as the asset values and cash flow of the Company does not warrant the amount of debt. Therefore, in the opinion of the Loan Trustee, a restructuring of the Company's capital structure seems necessary.
The restructuring (including a debt to equity swap of some of the debt of Company and raise of the new share capital) and the Proposal together with the support and guarantee from Aker ASA are, in the opinion of the Loan Trustee, a fair and balanced restructuring plan and should therefore be accepted by the Bondholders.
Nevertheless, the Bondholders themselves must evaluate, based on all information available with respect to the Company and the Guarantor, whether the Proposal should be accepted or not. It is recommended that the Bondholders consult with their own tax, legal and financial advisors as possible consequences of the Proposal.

- Vi har gjo rt forøk som viser at vi få r 15 prosent bedre tilvekst på laks på 5,5 ki!o, sier Nordrum, Han mener det kan være flere grunner til den økte tilveksten, men den mest tiigjenglige forklaringa er at laksen synes det smaker så godt at den spiser mer for.
De gode resultatene fra forsøkene var bakgrunnen for a t Polarfeed gikk ut og spurte sine kunder om dette var et konsept de hadde lyst til å være med på,
