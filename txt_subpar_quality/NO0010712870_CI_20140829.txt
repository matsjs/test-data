DigiPlex Fet AS Board of Directors' Report For the six months ended 30 June 2014
Register no. 912189287
DigiPlex Fet AS was founded in July 2013 when it signed one of the largest data centre deals in Europe for its facility at Heiaveien 9 in the municipality of Fet, near Oslo.
The 21.5 years contract with Evry AS (one of the two largest IT service companies in Scandinavia) secures revenue for its 4,200 m2 o f IT space, served by 12 megawatts of power. The high security facility will benefit from DigiPlex's industry leading Air-toAir cooling technology delivering a Power Usage Efficiency (P.U.E) ratio of 1.1, which places it in the top 3 per cent of data centres worldwide and ensuring a sustainable performance with minimum environmental footprint.
Construction commenced in February 2014 and the company is on target to deliver the first of its six scheduled phases of 700 m2 each to Evry AS in Q4 2014. The last phase is scheduled to be delivered at the beginning of Q2 2016.
The company expanded its capital resources in this period when it completed on a NOK500million bond issue where Pareto Securities AS acted as the sole manager. The proceeds from the bond with a maturity date of 11 June 2019 will be used mainly to finance the construction of the facility. The sole shareholder of the company, DigiPlex Fet LLC has funded an amount of NOK204million as of 30 June 2014, of which NOK30million will be repaid from the proceeds of the bond issue.
There is no operational revenue in this period; however, in preparing the business for the handover of the first phase in Q4 2014, operational expenses such as fees for management and accounting support have been incurred. Furthermore, the fees paid to Pareto Securities AS will be amortised over the tenor of the Bond starting from June 2014.

DigiPlex Fet AS Notes to the Financial Statements
Accounting principles The financial statements for the quarter ended 30 June 2014 have been prepared in accordance with NGAAP.
Accounting policies Sales Revenues IT housing service revenues will be recognised and expensed over the designated term of each respective contract.
Classification and valuation of balance sheet items Assets intended for long term ownership or use have been classified as fixed assets. Assets relating to the trading cycle have been classified as current assets. Receivables are classified as current assets if they are to be repaid within one year after the transaction date. Similar criteria apply to liabilities. Current assets are valued at the lower of cost price and net realizable value. Short term liabilities are reflected in the balance sheet at nominal value on the establishment date.
Fixed assets are valued at purchase cost. Fixed assets whose value will deteriorate are depreciated on a straight line basis over the asset's estimated useful life. The fixed assets are written down to net realizable value if a value reduction occurs which is not believed to be temporary.

Fixed assets
Fixed assets are reflected in the balance sheet and depreciated over the asset's expected useful life on a straight-line basis. Direct maintenance o f an asset is expensed under operating expenses as and when it is incurred. Additions or improvements are added to the asset's cost price and depreciated together with the asset. The split between maintenance and additions/improvements is calculated in proportion to the asset's condition at the purchase date.
Debtors Trade debtors and other debtors are reflected in the balance sheet at nominal value less provisions for doubtful debts. Provisions for doubtful debts are calculated on the basis o f individual assessments. In addition, for the remainder of accounts receivables outstanding balances, a general provision is carried out based on expected loss.
Foreign currencies Monetary items in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
Tax
The tax charge in the income statement includes both payable taxes for the period and changes in deferred tax. Deferred tax is calculated at 27% on the basis of the temporary differences which exist between accounting and tax values, and any carryforward losses for tax purposes at the year-end. Tax enhancing or tax reducing temporary differences, which are reversed or may be reversed in the same period, have been eliminated. Deferred tax and tax benefits which may be shown in the balance sheet are presented net. The company chose to capitalize the deferred tax advantage.
