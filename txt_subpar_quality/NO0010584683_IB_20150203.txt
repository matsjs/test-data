15.00 per cent InterOil Exploration & Production ASA Senior Callable Bond Issue 2010/2016

Oslo, 3 February 2015

PAYMENT OF INTEREST ORIGINALLY DUE ON 14 DECEMBER 2014
Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee") acts as bond trustee for the holders o f the 15 per cent Interoil Exploration & Production ASA Senior Callable Bond Issue 2010/2016 (the "Bond") issued by Interoil Exploration & Production ASA (the "Issuer").
Reference is made to the summons to Bondholders' Meeting dated 6 January 2015 (the "Summons") and the information letter to the Bondholders regarding record dates dated 20 January 2015 (the "Information Letter"). All capitalised terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the bond agreement for the Bond between, amongst others, the Issuer and the Bond Trustee (acting for and on behalf of the holders of the Bonds (the "Bondholders")) dated 8 September 2010 (the "Bond Agreement"), the Summons and the Information Letter.
The interest coupon of NOK 11,625,000 originally due on the 14 December 2014 (the "December Coupon") has been received by the Bond Trustee. However, there is an ongoing discussion to whether the Issuer is entitled to a repayment of the total amount of NOK 3,262,295 (the "Prepayment" /"Potential Claim") received from the Issuer in November 2014 as a prepayment to cover cost of the Bond Trustee and its advisers. Due to this Potential Claim the Bond Trustee will hold back an amount of NOK 4,762,295 of the December Coupon to potentially cover the Potential Claim and a reseive of NOK 1,500,000 related to negotiations and potential litigation o f the Potential Claim (the "Retained Amount"). Total accrued costs amounts to NOK 8,713,260, partly covered by the Prepayment and partly by the December Coupon.
The holders of the coupon claim will receive the remaining amount of the December Coupon (NOK 1,411,740) on or about 4 February 2015. Potential distribution from the Retained Amount will be announced in due course.
Yours sincerely
