Joint Administrators' Final Report
2. Conduct of the Administration
Purpose of the Administration
2.1 Pursuant to Paragraph 3 of the Schedule B1 of the Act, the purpose of the administration was to rescue the Company as a going concern.
Shares in lona/Orlando and Kells Licenses
2.2 We are pleased to confirm that on 13 April 2017 the sale of the shares in the Company to Decipher Energy Limited was completed.
West Wick
2.3 The deferred and contingent transaction proceeds from the sale of the Company's interest in West Wick have been assigned to the Security Trustee, effective on Completion of the sale of the Company.
Receipts and payments during the Period 2.4 Please find at Appendix B the receipts and payments accounts. Narrative in relation to the receipts and payments is
included at Appendix C.
Taxation
2.5 Appropriate filings have been made to support the Company's corporation tax and VAT positions at the date of the administrations. The Company has received a VAT refund of £1.9m for the pre-administration period and a total of £634k to date for the post administration period.
Statutory Investigations
2.6 As reported previously, we have concluded our statutory investigation work in accordance with SIP2, and complied with our statutory duties pursuant to the Companies Directors Disqualification Act 1986.
3. Estimated Outcomes
Secured creditors 3.1 At the date of the appointment the secured creditors were owed $263m by the Companies. The secured creditors held a
number of securities which were listed in the SIP 16 letter to creditors and included as Appendix G in the Administrators' proposals dated 9 February 2016.
3.2 The amount due to the secured creditors was net of $57.1m restricted cash which had been distributed to the Security Trustee prior to the date of appointment. Of this amount $56m has been distributed by the Security Trustee to bondholders with the remaining $1m held as contingency. In addition a further £355k was paid to the Security Trustee in relation to cash on appointment held by Bank of America, which was realised in April 2017.
3.3 Following the completion of the sale of the shares of the Company $1.5m was paid by the buyer to the Security Trustee as repayment of Senior Debt.
3.4 In addition to the above and as part of the sale a deferred debt repayment $3.5m is payable on receipt of an agreement or letter of extension by the OGA of the Orlando Licence to a date no earlier than 30 June 2018, to allow completion of the existing, or any modified secretary approved, FDP; or payable on the granting of a new licence to the Company in respect of the same area and having equivalent effect to the above.
3.5 Conditional upon the approval of the FDP, West Wick would result in additional realisations to the Security Trustee of $1.76m.
Preferential creditors
3.6 The Company has no preferential creditors.
Unsecured creditors 3.7 Unsecured creditors rank behind both secured and preferential creditors.
3.8 Under Section 176A of the Act where after 15 September 2003 the company has granted a creditor a floating charge, a proportion of the net property of the company achieved from floating charge asset realisations must be made available for the unsecured creditors ("the Prescribed Part").

Joint Administrators' Final Report
3.9 The Prescribed Part applies where there are net floating charge realisations (i.e. after costs of realisation) available to unsecured creditors and is calculated as follows: · 50% of net property up to £10k · Plus 20% of net property in excess of £10k · Subject to a maximum of £600k
3.10 As previously advised the CVA expressly disapplies the obligation under s176A(2) of the Act for the Administrators to set aside the prescribed part. A distribution of $2m will be made shortly to unsecured creditors from the CVA of the Company.
4. Summary of Proposals and Exit Route
4.1 The administrators' proposals are included below as required by Rule 2.42 of the Rules. There have been no amendments or deviations from these proposals. We will continue to manage the affairs of the Company in order to achieve the purpose of the Administration. · To do all such other things and generally exercise all of our powers as contained in Schedules B1 and 1 of the Act, as we consider desirable or expedient to achieve the statutory purpose of the Administration. · To consider whether a CVA proposal should be issued and if so formulate a CVA for creditors. · To investigate and as appropriate pursue any claims the Company may have.

Rules. There will be no further reports to creditors in respect of the administration of the Company. 4.4 The Administrators will be discharged from liability in accordance with Paragraph 98(1) of Schedule B1 of the Act immediately

Appendix D - Administrators' time costs and expenses

Pre-Administration fees
Our fees incurred in relation to pre-administration advisory services totaled £1.4m. Please refer to previous reports for further disclosure on these fees.
Administrators' fee basis
Pursuant to Rules 2.39(4) of the Rules, the basis for fixing the amount of the remuneration payable to the administrator may be a commission calculated by reference to the value of the company's assets which have been realised by the administrator, but there shall in any event be taken into account -
a. the work which, having regard to that value, was reasonably undertaken by him; and
b. the extent of his responsibilities in administering the company's assets.
The basis of the Administrators' remuneration was by reference to time properly given by the Administrators and their staff attending to matters in the administration.
Fee approval
We have been given approval from the Secured Creditors to draw administrators fees.
A copy of the 'Creditors' Guide to Administrators' Fees' is available at:
http://www.fticonsulting-emea.com/~/media/Files/emea--files/creditors-portal/cip-emea-forms-info/creditors-guide-toadministrators-remuneration-scotland.pdf

Category 1 expenses are not subject to creditor approval. Category 2 disbursements do require approval from creditors and relate to services provided to the office holder by associated company and costs which are apportioned overheads such as mileage and data storage. Further details in relation to this can be found at Appendix F together with additional information in relation to our policy on staffing, the use of subcontractors, and details of our current charge out rates by staff grade. Administrators' fee estimate Fee estimates of £665,048 were included in the Administrators proposals. The time costs incurred to date are £1,700,006. Of this amount £1,266,864 has been billed, with the remainder being written off. During the Period fees of £290,152 have been billed. Time costs have exceeded the estimate due to the protracted timeframe and complexity of the transaction. As Administrators' Fee estimates are not a requirement in accordance with the Scottish Rules, further approval is not required in relation to the Company's fees that exceed the estimate provided in the proposals.

Joint Administrators' Final Report

Appendix F - Additional Information in relation to Administrators' fees pursuant to SIP9
Detailed below is FTI's policy in relation to:
· staff allocation and the use of sub-contractors;
· professional advisors; and
· disbursements.
Staff allocation and the use of subcontractors
Our general approach to resourcing our assignments is to allocate staff with the skills and experience to meet the specific requirements of the case.
The constitution of the case team will usually consist of a Senior Managing Director, Managing Director, Director, Senior Consultant and Consultant. The exact constitution of the case team will depend on the anticipated size and complexity of the assignment.
With regard to support staff, we would advise that time spent by cashiers in relation to specific tasks on an assignment is charged. Only if there is a large block of time incurred by a member of the secretarial team, e.g., report compilation and distribution, do we seek to charge and recover our time in this regard.
Professional advisors
On this assignment we have used the professional advisors listed below. We have also indicated alongside, the basis of our fee arrangement with them, which is subject to review on a regular basis.

Name of professional advisor
CMS Cameron McKenna LLP and Thomessen (legal advice) Akin Gump LLP (legal advice - bondholder & administrators) HBJ Gateley (Huntington license matters) Appleby (Cayman law advice) Insolvency Support Services Limited RSM (payroll services) Sweeney Kincaid (asset realisations)

Basis of fee arrangement

Fixed fee per payroll Percentage of realisations

Fees paid to date (£'000)

3 8

Our choice was based on our view of their experience and ability to perform this type of work, the complexity and nature of the assignment and the basis of our fee arrangement with them.
We have utilized the services of other teams within FTI Consulting LLP to assist with the Administration processes. The fees of our tax, technology and strategic communication teams have been included in our SIP9 analysis provided to creditors of the Company and allocated to the work streams and entities to which their work related.
We consider that the rates chargeable for these services are in line with general market practice and that the service is comparable to similar firms of professional advisors. In addition, by working closely with our internal teams, we believe a more coordinated and cost-effective approach to the Administration work streams has been possible.
Disbursements
Category 1 disbursements do not require approval by creditors. The type of disbursements that may be charged as a Category 1 disbursement to a case generally comprise of external supplies of incidental services specifically identifiable to the case, such as postage, case advertising, invoiced travel and external printing, room hire and document storage. Also chargeable will be any properly reimbursed expenses incurred by personnel in connection with the case.
Category 2 disbursements do require approval from creditors. These disbursements can include costs incurred which relate to payments due to associated companies for the provision of services to the office holder.

Rule 2.39A - Appeal against fixing of remuneration
(6) If the administrator's remuneration [and outlays have] been fixed by the creditors' committee or by the creditors, any creditor or creditors of the company representing in value at least 25 percent of the creditors may apply to the court not later than 8 weeks after the end of an accounting period for an order that the administrator's remuneration [or outlays be reduced on the grounds that they are, in all the circumstances, excessive].

(8) The court may, if it appears to be a proper case, order the expenses of the creditor making the application to be paid as an expense of the administration.
