NO UNSECURED EQUITY NOTICE

By the deadline, 17.00 (Oslo time) Monday 14 November 2011, less than 50% of the outstanding Unsecured Bonds had returned an executed form of Unsecured Equity Notice. Accordingly, a valid Unsecured Equity Notice has not been served on the Bond Trustee in accordance with terms of the Bondholder Summons. Hence, the Secured Bondholders are not required - or entitled - to acquire the Unsecured Equity.
