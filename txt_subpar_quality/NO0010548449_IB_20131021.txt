· Company will not be able to pay NOR04 interests in November unless waivers from RBL banks are obtained and the Refinancing Proposal is approved

· Further, Noreco is not in position to repay its debt maturities in December due to continued production shortfalls

Noreco currently does not have funds to comply with this requirement

9 As a result, a refinancing of bonds and an equity issue is necessary to create a robust long-term solution for the Company

· Asset values best preserved through continued business

5

Background for refinancing
Production shortfalls have deferred funds in magnitude of NOK 600m compared to business plan for 2013 This is due to operational problems on all fields - Huntington ramp-up significantly delayed due to commissioning related issues. Currently production is constrained by the
BP operated CATS pipeline - Oselvar has been shut down due to various issues on the Ula platform and the field is delivering below expectations - Siri Fairway is shut down due to crack detected on Siri platform and timing of start-up uncertain - Lulita shutdown from April to September due to an unsuccessful repair of a valve in the Harald gas export pipeline
· The operational issues and bond maturity profile has made it difficult to renew current RBL facility or establish a new one - Slow Huntington ramp-up has delayed reclassification of the field to a "producing" asset in accordance with RBL agreement - Shutdown of Danish assets and increased opex has reduced RBL borrowing base - Uncertainty regarding Siri Fairway abandonment commitments - Current RBL facility reduced significantly from USD 70m to USD 25m due to the production shortfall - Not possible to establish an RBL with large bond maturities within the RBL loan period
· Noreco will not be able to meet bond maturities based on current cash flow forecasts, even when including the additional tax refund of NOK 723m to be released around 20 December 2013
· Potential cash shortfall expected to be bridged if refinancing proposal is successful
· The contemplated NOK 400-430m private placement and up to NOK 100m subsequent offering combined with a full refinancing of the existing bonds will provide the Company with a robust capital structure going forward - Company can continue operations as a going concern, preserving values for bond and shareholders - Company can maintain an exploration program providing upside for shareholders - Unsecured and Oselvar bondholders will have equity exposure through a newly issued convertible bond

· Tax value of NOK 723 million to be released on or about 20 December 2013
· In November 2011 Noreco sold its 20% interest in PL 435 for NOK 180m · Under the agreement Noreco is entitled to a volume-dependent consideration payable upon approval of a Plan for
Development and Operations (PDO) which includes Zidane-2 · The consideration is expected in 2014 and is estimated to NOK 0-90m
· Book value of insurance claim NOK 356m (per 30.06.2013) · Actual claim is in excess of NOK 2.0bn and final documentation will be submitted in October 2013 · The best estimate of the management is that this case will be solved within the next twelve months. · Due to the uncertain outcome and timing of the case, the related cash-inflow is excluded from the cash balance

Key Risk Factors

Key Risk Factors

MQRSCO

Introduction
To be invested in securities issued by the Company involves inherent risks. Prospective and existing investors should carefully consider, among other things, the risk factors set out below and elsewhere in this Presentation before making a decision on whether to participate in the proposed equity and/or bond refinancing as set out
herein. This section is not intended to be exhaustive - additional risks and uncertainties e.g as are not presently known to the Company, or that it currently deems
immaterial, m ay also impair the Noreco Group's business operations or the value o f securities issued by the Company. The Company cannot assure investors that any o f the events discussed in the risk factors below will not materialize. If they do, the Noreco Group's business, financial condition, results o f operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price o f securities issued by the Company could decline, and an investor may lose all or part o f its investment. An investment in securities issued by the Company is suitable only for investors understanding the risks associated with this type o f investment and who can afford a loss o f all or part o f the investment.
Risks related to the Group and the industry it operates within
· Ability to obtain economically recoverable oil and gas resen/es. The Noreco Group is dependent on its ability to find, acquire, appraise, develop and commercially produce oil and gas reserves. The Noreco Group must continually locate and develop or acquire new reserves to replace its existing reserves that are being depleted sbeylepcrot dauncdtioancq. uFiuretusreuitianbclreeaasdedsitiionnthael pNroopreecrtoieGs reoiuthpe'sr trhersoeurgvhesawwiallrddsepaetnlidcennostinognlyroounnditss oarbtihlitryoutoghexapcloqrueisaitniodnsd.eRveelsoeprvitesseaxinsdtinrgesporuorpceerstieinsfobrumtaatlisoon ornepirtsesaebniltity to Company estimates which may be inaccurate or incorrect.

Changes in the legislative and fiscal framework governing the activities of the companies engaged within the oil and gas sector may have a material impact on exploration and development activity or directly affect the Noreco Group's operations. In particular, changes in political regimes will constitute a material risk factor for the Noreco Group's operations in foreign countries. Further, the Noreco Group is faced with increasingly complex tax laws. The amounts of taxes the Noreco Group pays, or the ability to claim tax refunds, could change substantially as a result of amendments in, or new interpretations of, these laws, which could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and results of operations.

Key Risk Factors

Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) risks. AH phases of the oil business present environmental risks and hazards and are subject to environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of international conventions, EU, and state and municipal laws and regulations. The discharge of oil, natural gas or other pollutants into the air, scooiml oprlywwaittehr cmuarryengtivHeSrEiselatwosliaabnidlitireesgutolaftoiorenisgnhagsorveesrunlmteednatsndanmdatyhirind tphaertfiuetsuraendremsualtyinrerqeugiurelatthoeryCaocmtiopna,ntyhetoiminpcousrictioosntsoftofinreems eodr ythseupchaydmisecnhtaorgfec.oTmhpeenfasialutiroentoto third parties which each could in turn have a material adverse effect on the Noreco Group's business, financial condition and results of operations.

The industry in which the Group operates is highly competitive. The Noreco Group competes with other exploration and production companies, many of which include major international oil and gas companies which may have greater financial resources, staff and facilities than those of the Noreco Group. Due to this competitive environment, the Noreco Group may be unable to acquire attractive suitable properties or prospects on terms that it considers acceptable. As a result, the Noreco Group's revenues may decline over time, thereby materially and adversely affecting its results of operations or financial condition.

Debt arrangements m ay restrict the Noreco Group's business. The Noreco Group's debt arrangements contain several restrictive covenants, including but not limited to restrictions on assets sales and acquisitions, investments, the ability to pay dividends or other capital distributions, and the possibility to raise additional financial indebtedness. In addition, several financial covenants are imposed on the Company and the Noreco Group. Such covenants restrict the Noreco Group in various ways in terms of how the Noreco Group conducts its business, and the Noreco Group may be restricted in responding to changing market conditions or in pursuing favorable business opportunities. Further, the Noreco Group has to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to service debt, which in turn will reduce the amount of cash flow it will have available for capital investment, working capital and other general corporate purposes.

production of oil and a large proportion of

gas is concentrated in its production licences,

a small number of offshore fields. The in particular in Denmark and in the

Huntington licence on the UKCS. There is a risk that the production from these and other fields will remain unstable, causing material adverse effects on the Noreco

Group's income and financial position, and thus ability to service its bond and other debts.

Key Risk Factors

· Risk o fjo in t and several liability with its license partners. The Noreco Group is liable on a joint and several basis together with its license partners for certain of the liabilities of the specific license group. Such liability may apply both to licenses in their initial term and to producing licenses.

· Unexpected shutdowns m ay occur. Mechanical problems, accidents, oil leaks, hazardous weather conditions or other events at the Noreco Group's producing fields or its pipelines or subsea infrastructure may cause an unexpected production shutdown or other negative effects at these fields.

· Risks associated with future decommissioning liabilities. The Noreco Group, through its license interests, has in the past assumed certain obligations in respect of the

· Risks associated with labour disputes. The Noreco Group's contractors or service providers may be limited in their flexibility in dealing with their staff due to the presence of trade unions among their staff. If there is a material disagreement between contractors or service providers and their staff belonging to trade unions, the Noreco Group's operations could suffer an interruption or shutdown.

Furthermore, legal proceedings could be ruled against the Noreco Group and the Group could be required to, inter alia, pay damages, halt its operations, stop its expansion projects, etc.·

· It may be difficult for investors based in the United States to enforce civil liabilities predicated on U.S. securities laws against the Company, its affiliates, directors and officers. It may be difficult for investors in the United States to effect service of process within the United States upon the Company or the Company's directors and officers or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws against the Company or the Company's directors and officers. In addition, punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may be unenforceable in Norway.

Risks related to the Group's financial position and liquidity

The debt arrangements include security interests over major parts of the Noreco Group's assets, several covenants and undertakings of a general, financial and technical nature and several of the debt arrangements contain cross-default provisions. Failure by the borrowers or other obligors to meet any of the covenants or undertakings could result in all outstanding amounts under the different debt arrangements becoming immediately due for payment.

· Risk associated with exchange rate fluctuations. The Noreco Group has operations which generate significant cash flows in a variety of currencies. The Noreco Group also comprises businesses with various functional currencies (USD and NOK). Although the Noreco Group may undertake limited hedging activities in an attempt to reduce certain currency fluctuation risks, these activities provide only limited protection against currency-related losses.

need to obtain further external debt and equity financing at a future date. There is no assurance that such additional funding, if required, will be available on

acceptable terms at the relevant time. This risk is exasperated by the recent developments, affecting e.g the amount available under the existing reserve based

lending facility (RBL), which following the latest redetermination has been reduced and is subject to further accelerated repayment as set out herein, with significant

liquidity effects for the Noreco Group. Furthermore, in light of the liquidity position, there is a risk that the Noreco Group may suffer continued liquidity shortfalls

pending completion of the refinancing and equity issues. Should such liquidity shortfalls occur, Noreco will seek to take mitigating actions including through potential

interim bridge funding arrangements.·

· Risk related to reduction in nominal value . As part of the Private Placement, the nominal value of the Company's shares need to be reduced. The reduction in the nominal value cannot be completed until the Company has settled or otherwise clarified any objections to the reduction in nominal value made by relevant creditors during the six weeks notice period."
