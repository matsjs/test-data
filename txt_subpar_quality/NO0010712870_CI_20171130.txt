UPDATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2017
During the first nine months of 2017, the Company continued to provide IT housing solutions to its sole customer, EVRY.
For the nine months ended 30 September 2017, the Company's operating revenues totalled NOK 105.3 million, which reflects an increase of NOK 48.7 million compared to the operating revenue of NOK 56.6 million reported in the same period last year. The majority of the increase, approximately NOK 41 million, relates to an increase in added value services.
Operating expenses totalled NOK 58.9 million, which comprised of NOK 57.1 million of cost of goods sold, operational and management support costs; and NOK 1.8 million of personnel costs. The increase in operating expenses of NOK 35.6 million compared to the same period last year is largely due to the costs of providing the added value services, as described above, of approximately NOK 37.5 million offset by a net decrease of NOK 1.9 million in other operating expenses.
EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation) for the first nine months of 2017was NOK 46.4 million, which is 40% higher than the EBITDA reported in the same period last year.
A charge of NOK 25.8 million was made to reflect depreciation of the plant and equipment, and the Company incurred net finance costs of circa NOK 19.6 million, compared to NOK 30.1 million and NOK 20.8 million respectively in the same period last year.
In light of the above, the profit before income tax for the first nine months of the financial year 2017 came in at NOK 1.0 million, compared to a loss before income tax of NOK 17.7 million in the same period last year.
Cash generated from operations was NOK 34.8 million, compared to NOK 47.8 million in the same period last year.
Borrowings totalled NOK 496.5 million as at 30 September 2017, which reflects the Bond Issue completed in June 2014, and remains largely unchanged from year end 2016. Shareholder loans were reduced by NOK 32 million during the third quarter of 2017, ending at NOK 237.1 million as of 30 September 2017.
As at 30 September 2017, cash and cash equivalents stood at NOK 13.2 million compared to NOK 39.5 million at the end of 2016.
