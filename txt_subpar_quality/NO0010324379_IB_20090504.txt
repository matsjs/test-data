To the bondholders in:
ISIN: NO 001032437.9 - FRN Peterson AS Open Bond Issue 2006/2010 with Call Option
Oslo, 4 May 2009
A greem ent between the Com pany and the Bondholders
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the bond issue with ISIN NO001032437.9 (the "Loan") issued by Peterson AS (the "Borrower" or the "Company"). All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the loan agreement.
As the Bondholders are informed of, there have through the last months been conducted extensive discussions between the Company and the Bondholders in order to find a solution addressing the challenges the Company is facing in the present economic environment, hereunder to bridge the identified cash shortfall for 2009/2010. The Bondholders have through these discussions, in addition to the Loan Trustee, been represented by a bondholders committee whose members together hold a decisive majority in the Loan. The discussions have also involved the Company's major bank relation, DnB NOR Bank ASA.
The parties have now reached an agreement (the "Agreement") acceptable to both the Company and the Bondholders. The two main elements of the Agreement are:
· The maturity date for the Loan shall be extended to 28 June 2012
· DnB NOR Bank ASA releases further credit lines to the Company
The Agreement will formally have to be decided by a bondholders meeting. Summons to a bondholders meeting will be sent as soon as possible. The elements in the Agreement will in more detail be outline in the summons to the bondholders meeting. The members of the bondholders committee have undertaken to vote in favour of the proposed Agreement.
Yours Sincerely, NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
Hans Bernhard Lind
