Highlights from the quarter

Please note that all figures on pages 2 and 3 are pro forma including Odin Kapital, which was acquired in Q4 2017 (acquisition was closed on 3 November 2017), and include synergies. Moreover, please note that the accrued revenue principle was adopted in Q3 2017. In the Q4 2017 report, historical accrued revenue (NOK 71.5 million) and EBITDA (NOK 65.1 million) has been evenly distributed across all four quarters to present a comparable revenue, EBITDA and net profit development (see note #3 for further information) in 2017. Similarly, positive one-off accounting effects obtained in Q4 2016 have been evenly distributed across all four quarters of 2016 to create a like-for-like comparison between 2017 and 2016. Please note that the pro forma figures do not include a NOK 12 million non-recurring restructuring cost, of which the majority is related to the acquisition of Odin Kapital. For Melin Group figures, including Odin Kapital from the date of ownership 3 November 2017, in line with NGAAP accounting principles, see page 4 onwards.

Letter from the CEO

The fourth quarter 2017 was another solid quarter, both from an operational and financial perspective. A key priority in the fourth quarter was the successful closing of the Odin Kapital acquisition, which significantly increased Melin Group's customer base in the Norwegian healthcare sector. The integration of Odin Kapital's customers began in January. It will be completed in the first quarter. We expect minimal churn. Synergy effects will gradually increase throughout 2018, with expected full effect in 2019.
Consolidated pro forma revenues, including Odin Kapital, grew with 69 percent to NOK 90.1 million compared to Q4 last year (Q4 2016: NOK 53.3 million), while the EBITDA result ended at NOK 51.1 million, up from NOK 20.7 million in the same quarter last year. Total solutions in operation-terminals and invoicing solutions--increased from 1,609 in Q4 2016 to 1,780 in Q4. Churn remained low in the fourth quarter.
The Melin Group completed a NOK 1,000 million senior secured bond issue and a NOK 350 million 2nd lien bond issue in the fourth quarter. The proceeds secured the financial flexibility to pursue our aggressive growth strategy, both through organic growth and acquisitions. Subsequent to the quarter, we have announced the acquisitions of CrediCare AS, a well-established provider of payment solutions and administration systems for the Norwegian healthcare, dental, fitness and veterinary industries, and Gordion AB, which will make Melin Group the #1 provider of self-service payment solutions and administration systems to the Swedish healthcare industry. The acquisition of Gordion AB was closed in early February, while CrediCare AS is expected to be closed in March 2018.
With these acquisitions, Melin Group will be the leading provider of payment solutions and administration systems to the healthcare industry in both Norway and Sweden. Additionally, entering multiple sectors where Melin Group is not present today, such as the veterinary and fitness industries (CrediCare) as well as car rental and check-in terminals for ferry lines (Gordion), makes us less vulnerable to changes in national or industry-specific regulations. They also underline our strategy of branching out into new industry verticals and establishing a leading position at the physical point-of-sales channel, where self-service payment solutions and administrative systems can replace less cost-efficient ways of solving the needs of the end-user.
Melin Group pro forma figures, including Gordion and CrediCare, will be presented in the Q1 2018 report.
Best regards,

INGVILLHESTENES

Note 2--Accounting principles
This interim report has been prepared in accordance with Norske regnskapsstandarder (NGAAP). The accounting principles applied are the same as those applied in the latest annual reports of Melin Medical and Melin Collectors unless otherwise stated below. This report has not been subject to review by the Melin Group's auditor. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with NGAAP requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to make certain judgments in applying the group's accounting policies.

Note 3--Accrued revenue
Up until Q2 2017, Melin Group recognized revenue from invoice fee, reminder fee and debt collection fee at the time when the fee/claim was settled and paid. After gaining more experience and collecting empirical data regarding resolution rates and expected revenue from different patient segments, Melin Medical,4S and Melin Collectors ,4S in Q3 2017 adopted the accrued revenue principle, where recognition of invoice fee, reminder fee and debt collection fee is based on the expected revenues and resolution rates for the active claims / portfolio of claims. This principle for accrued revenue is in line with the principle applied by similar debt collection companies in the Nordic market.
By applying the accrued revenue principle from Q3 2017 onwards, Melin Group had the following one-off effects in the profit and loss statement for YTD Q3 2017 (equaling the accumulated accrued revenue as of 31 December 2016):
 One-off effect on revenue of MNOK 47.6  One-off effect on cost of materials of MNOK -2.9  One-off effect on EBITDA of MNOK 44.7
As per 31 December 2017 the total effect on accrued revenue was MNOK 71.5, the cost of materials was MNOK -6.2 and the EBITDA was MNOK 65.3.

Note 4--Consolidated financial statements
Please note that as Odin KapitalAS was acquired 3 November 2017, and in line with NGAAP standards have been integrated into the Melin Group accounts from this date. Also note that at the 30 June 2017, a demerger was carried out in Helseinnovasjon AS, where the shares in the subsidiary PatientSky AS was transferred to Helseinnovasjon II AS. Thus, in the consolidated financial statements presented here, PatientSky AS has been treated as an investment in associated companies (i.e. not included in the consolidated Melin Group figures).
As a consequence, the consolidated profit and loss, balance sheet and cash flow statements as of 31 December 2016 as presented in this interim report, do not reconcile back to the reported historical financial statements for the Melin Group.
