Completion Completion of the Restructuring, as defined in the Summons, is now accomplished.
Record Date Thursday 10 December 2009 (end of business) was be the record date for the Completion. Hence, bondholders and claimants of due not paid interest, registered in VPS at that time are the ones rightful to receive the New Bonds and shares as the case might be.
