Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM") acts as trustee for the holders of the bonds in the above mentioned issue (the "Bonds") with ISIN NO 001 060119.8 issued by Dannemora Mineral AB (the "Company").
On 26 March 2014, a meeting of the Bondholders approved the proposals contained in the Bondholder Meeting summons dated 19 March 2014 (the "Summons"). Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Summons.

The Waiver includes the temporary waiver of (i) the interest payment which became due in respect of the Bonds on 22 March 2014, (ii) the interest payment which became due in respect of the Bonds on 22 September 2013 and (iii) the breach of the MSEK 50 minimum liquidity covenant under the Bond Agreement.
In the context of continuing discussions and negotiations between the Company, its stakeholders and potential investors regarding a potential restructuring of its capital structure, NTM, having consulted its advisers, has exercised its discretion referred to above and agreed to further extend the Waiver to 25 April 2014.
Yours sincerely,
