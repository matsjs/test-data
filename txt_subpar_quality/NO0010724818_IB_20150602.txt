The Company has achieved another quarter with high uptime levels, Oro Negro's fleet registered an average uptime of 99.4% during the first quarter of 2015.

Laurus and Fortius ended the first quarter with an uptime of 100%, offering the best performance of Oro Negro's fleet, followed by Decus and Primus with an uptime of 99.6% and 99.4% respectively. Rig 3 had an average uptime of 94.8%, as a result of equipment failures.

On January 22, 2015, we took delivery of our fifth jackup drilling rig, the Impetus, from PPL Shipyard in Singapore, which arrived in Mexico on March 28, 2015.

Operational Results

Oro Negro has positioned itself as a leader in the oil field services sector with four premium jackups and one modular platform in operation. To date, the Company has invested over US$1.9 billion in assets, building enough scale to generate substantial operating synergies, and to position itself as a relevant operator of high specification equipment in Mexico with five of our rigs already under contract with PEMEX.

As mentioned before, our fleet had an outstanding utilization and there were no major incidents reported in any of the rigs.

Oro Negro is committed to maintaining the highest safety and environmental responsibility standards. We operate a Quality Management System (QMS) with its principles founded in our ZERO HARM policies; which are based upon ZERO HARM to people, the environment, and equipment.

Contract backlog is calculated by multiplying the day rate of our drilling contracts by the number of contract days remaining, assuming a full uptime rate. The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation, customer reimbursable, and bonuses.
Oro Negro's rigs are currently located in the bay of Campeche based in the Mexican Gulf of Mexico performing both exploratory and development drilling activities for PEMEX.

Balance sheet
As of March 31, 2015, total assets amounted to US$1,491.7M. Current assets totaled US$156.2M, mainly comprised by cash and equivalents (US$78.3M) and trade and other receivables (US$65.3M). Total long-term assets added up to US$1,335.5M. Cash and cash equivalents balance added up to US$78.3M at the end of the period of which US$25.0M were classified as restricted cash to comply with the liquidity reserve of our outstanding debt, US$12.1M were reserved for debt service, and US$6.7M were provisioned for a major maintenance and for the surveys that each jackup undergoes every 5 years after starting operations. Trade and other receivables are comprised of PEMEX payments (US$42.4M), recoverable taxes (US$19.4M), and prepaid expenses to suppliers (US$3.5M). During the fourth quarter of 2014, Trade and other receivables increased substantially (US$75.3M) given Pemex delays in payments. The company managed to collect all the pending invoices during the first quarter of 2015. Fixed assets amounted to US$1,301.2M. These are composed by property and equipment (rigs already delivered), and advanced payments made for the rigs under construction, additional adaptations to the rigs, and pre-operational expenses. Total liabilities amounted to US$950.3M, of which US$243.3M are considered current liabilities, mainly composed of current portion of long-term debt US$204.8M, trade and other payables US$23.8M, current portion of deferred revenue US$7.9M, and other short term liabilities US$6.7M, and US$707.0M are long-term liabilities. Total debt at the end of the period was US$900.0M, which is composed by the US$725.0M bond issued in January, 2014, and the US$175.0M bridge bond issued in December 2014. Given that under IFRS borrowings are recognized at fair value in the balance sheet, net of transaction costs, and transaction costs are amortized throughout the financing term, the balance sheet will reflect the total debt principal until the maturity date.

Revenues for the first quarter of 2015, ended on March 31, 2015, amounted to US$65.5M, a 58% increase compared to the US$41.2M obtained during the first quarter of 2014.
Revenues are generated from the operation of our drilling rigs, including four premium jackups and one modular rig. The increase in revenues compared to the first quarter of 2014 is explained by the uptime improvement and by the fact that the Fortius and Decus did not operate during the first quarter of 2014. The company achieved a 99.4% uptime during the first quarter of 2015.
Operating costs for the first quarter of 2015, amounted to US$32.0M, there was a 9.5% increase compared to the US$29.2M expensed during the first quarter of 2014. The increase in drilling costs is also driven by the fact that the Fortius and Decus did not operate during the first quarter of 2014.
Personnel costs are the most relevant operating cost representing ~65% of the total rig direct operating costs during the first quarter of 2015.
Gross profit for the first quarter amounted to US$33.4M, an increase of approximately US$21.3M or 77% compared to the first quarter of 2015.
