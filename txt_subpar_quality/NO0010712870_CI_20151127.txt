DigiPlex Fet AS (`the Company') Management Commentary
For the nine months to 30 September 2015
Organisation no. 912 189 287
BACKGROUND
This report should be read in conjunction with the Company's 2014 audited financial statements dated 28 April 2015, and the condensed interim Q1 and Q2 2015 financial statements issued on 29 May 2015 and 28 August 2015 respectively. As at the date of this report, both of these financial statements were readily available for download from the Oslo Børs website.
The enclosed financial statements are the condensed interim results for the nine months ended 30 September 2015. These are not a full set of accounts and have not been audited.
UPDATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2015
The Company successfully delivered the first three phases (each 700m2 of white space) of the data centre to EVRY AS (`EVRY') in the nine months ended 30 September 2015 (i.e. on 19 January 2015, 13 March 2015 and 1 June 2015).
As a result the Company is now managing two different components; being the construction of the remaining phases and the operation of the phases delivered. We note the following in this regard:
 The Company continued to drawdown from the proceeds of the NOK 500 million bonds issued on 11 June 2014 to finance the construction of the facility; and the Company remains adequately funded to meet its contractual obligations

 The Company has also successfully delivered the fourth phase of 700m2 on 1 October 2015 and currently is on target to deliver on time to EVRY the remaining two scheduled phases of 700 m2 each, in Q4 2015 and in Q1 2016
INCOME STATEMENT AND STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
Following the successful delivery of the phases as scheduled, the Company has commenced to receive operational income and incur associated operational expenses. Notwithstanding, operational set up costs continue to be incurred in preparing the business for the handover of the remaining phases.
Operating revenues totalled NOK 18.5 million, and operating expenses totalled NOK 17.7 million, which comprised of NOK 16.3 million of operational, management and accounting support costs and NOK 1.4 million of personnel costs.
A charge of NOK 11.2 million was made to reflect depreciation of the phases delivered to EVRY, and the company incurred net finance costs of circa NOK 0.2m.
In light of the above, the operating loss for the first nine months of 2015 comes in at NOK 10.6 million which resulted in a tax benefit of NOK 2.8 million (applying the corporate tax rate of 27%).
Total assets increased by NOK 12.2 million, which was driven by an increase in trade receivables.
