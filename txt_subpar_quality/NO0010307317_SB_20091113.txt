The information in this summons regarding the Borrower and market conditions are provided by the Borrower, and the Loan Trustee expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever related to such information,
The Borrower has approached the Loan Trustee to summon a Bondholders' Meeting with respect to each of the Loans in order to propose to the Bondholders a financial restructuring of the Borrower.
2. Company update
The Borrower will publish its quarterly report for the quarter ended 30 September 2009 on 13 November 2009, and the Bondholders are encouraged to review such quarterly report in full to get an update of the Borrower's financial and operational status. The quarterly report will be made available on the Borrower's web site www.crewgold.com, on SEDAR on www.sedar.com and on NewsWeb on www.newsweb.no.
3. The proposed restructuring
The Borrower has engaged Arctic Securities ASA (the "Advisor") as financial advisor and manager of the proposed financial restructuring (the "Restructuring").
The Restructuring is proposed to be carried out as follows:
I) Partial conversion of the 2006 Bond - 50% of the Bonds in the 2006 Bond shall be converted into new common shares of the Borrower with no par value ("Common Shares") as follows:
a. The NOK Tranche of the 2006 Bond - To facilitate the conversion, the nominal value of the Bonds in the NOK Tranche of the 2006 Bond shall be changed to NOK 1.00 through a split of each convertible bond with nominal value of NOK 500,000 into 500,000 Bonds with nominal value of NOK 1.00 each. Immediately following the split, 50% of the total number of Bonds held by each Bondholder will be converted into new Common Shares at a conversion price of NOK 0.6396 (the "NOK Conversion Price"). In total, NOK 65.5 million of the current outstanding principal amount of NOK 131 million, will be converted into 102,411,260 Common Shares, resulting in the Bondholders in the NOK Tranche of the 2006 Bond in aggregate holding 4.79% of all the Common Shares outstanding in the Borrower immediately after the completion of the Restructuring (the "Completion").
b. The USD Tranche of the 2006 Bond - 50% of the Bonds held by each Bondholder will be converted into new Common Shares at a conversion price of USD 0.1142 (the "USD Conversion Price"). In total, USD 39,041,879 of the current outstanding principal amount of USD 78,083,789 will be converted into 341,841,921 Common Shares, resulting in the Bondholders in the 2009 Bond in aggregate holding 15.99% of all the Common Shares outstanding in the Borrower immediately after the Completion.

c. Interest - Accrued and unpaid interest on the amount of the 2006 Bond being converted into Common Shares up to and including the date of the Completion shall be paid on the next scheduled Payment Date (for the avoidance of doubt, the record date of such payment is the date of conversion and payment will be made to the same Bondholders that receive shares).
d. Additional security for the 2006 Bond - In consideration of the Bondholders in the 2006 Bond approving the Restructuring, the Borrower agrees to procure that on demand guarantees in favour of the Loan Trustee in support of the Borrower's obligations under the Loan Agreement for the 2006 Bond are provided from each of Societe Miniere de Dinguiraye, Delta Gold Mining Ltd., Kenor AS and Guinor Gold Corp., all being subsidiaries of the Borrower, provided, however, that such guarantees shall not be required to the extent that the provision of those guarantees would:
(i) result in any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference or thin capitalisation laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) or other laws and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction; or
(ii) result in a significant risk to the officers of the relevant guarantor of contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or of civil or criminal liability.
e. Amendments to the Loan Agreement - The Loan Agreement for the 2006 Bond shall be amended as follows:
The maturity of the Loan shall be extended from 30 March 2011 to 30 September 2011.
The following provisions shall be added to the Loan Agreement:
Borrower's obligations: The Borrower shall not, without the approval of the Loan Trustee or, where necessary, the Bondholders' meeting:
(i) make any dividend repayment, repurchase of shares or other distribution to its shareholders;
(ii) allow any other member of the Group to make any dividend repayment, repurchase of shares or other distribution to its shareholders other than to the extent required to fund the Borrower's debt service payments or corporate expenses;
(iii) incur, or allow any member of the Group to incur, any additional Financial Indebtedness unless such Financial Indebtedness is unsecured and falls due after the maturity date for the Loan; and
(iv) save for disposals in the ordinary course of business, allow any member of the Group to sell, transfer, lend, pledge or otherwise dispose of any material assets owned by any member of the Group used for the purpose of the operation of the LEFA gold mine in Guinea.

Immediately following the split, 80% of the total number of Bonds held by each Bondholder will be converted into new Common Shares at the NOK Conversion Price. In total, NOK 97.6 million of the current outstanding principal amount of NOK 122 million will be converted into 152,600,595 Common Shares, resulting in the Bondholders in the 2004 Bond in aggregate holding 7.14% of all the Common Shares outstanding in the Borrower immediately after the Completion.
b. 2005 Bond - To facilitate the conversion, the nominal value of the Bonds in the 2005 Bond shall be changed to NOK 1.00 through a split of each convertible bond with nominal value of NOK 500,000 into 500,000 Bonds with nominal value of NOK 1.00 each. Immediately following the split, 80% of the total number of Bonds held by each Bondholder will be converted into new Common Shares at the NOK Conversion Price. In total, NOK 95.2 million of the current outstanding principal amount of NOK 119 million will be converted into 148,848,122 Common Shares, resulting in the Bondholders in the 2005 Bond in aggregate holding 6.96% of all the Common Shares outstanding in the Borrower immediately after the Completion.
c. 2009 Bond - To facilitate the conversion, the nominal value of the Bonds in the 2009 Bond shall be changed to USD 1.00 through a split of each convertible bond with nominal value of USD 72,380 into 72,380 Bonds with nominal value of USD 1.00 each.

d. Remaining debt and accrued interest - The remaining 20% principal balance of the 2004 Bond, the 2005 Bond and the 2009 Bond, together with all accrued and unpaid interest up to and including the date of the Completion, shall be rolled into a new bond loan (the "New Bond") with the following terms:
The loan agreement shall be based on a duplicate of the Loan Agreement for the 2006 Bond (after inclusion of the amendments set out in section I (e) above).
Maturity date: 30 September 2012

One USD and one NOK tranche, so that each Bondholder will hold the same currency post the Restructuring.
Interest: 9.5% for the NOK tranche and 7.3% for the USD tranche, payable quarterly in arrears.
Security: Same security package as the 2006 Bond, but on second priority, after the 2006 Bond.
III) Partial conversion of loan from Intex Resources ASA - As part of the Restructuring, it is proposed that Intex Resources ASA ("Intex") shall: (i) convert 80% of the principal of USD 9,784,000 currently outstanding under the loan agreement between the Borrower and Intex dated 30 October 2008 (the "Intex Loan"), constituting 80% of such outstanding principal, to 68,533,178 Common Shares at the USD Conversion Price, which conversion will result in Intex holding 3.20%; and (ii) convert the remaining 20% principal balance of the Intex Loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest on the Intex Loan up to and including the date of the Completion to bonds in the New Bond.
IV) General - Upon the conversion of Bonds into Common Shares (the "Conversion"), no fractions of Common Shares will be issued, and the number of Common Shares issued to the Bondholders will be rounded down to the nearest whole new Common Share. The new Common Shares issued upon the Conversion may not be sold, transferred, hypothecated or otherwise traded on or through the facilities of the TSX or otherwise in Canada or to or for the benefit of a Canadian resident for a period of 4 months and 1 day from the date of issue of the new Common Shares (the "Restricted Period"). Until the Restricted Period has lapsed, the new shares issued upon the conversion will be registered on a separate ISIN and listed on Oslo Børs. Immediately after the Restricted Period has lapsed, such new shares will be registered under the same ISIN as the existing shares of the Borrower and admitted to trading on TSX.
V) Board representation - The Borrower undertakes to procure that two of the current five directors of the Borrower's Board of Directors resign, and that Bob Byford, Mitchell Gropper and Gordon Lawson are appointed as new directors, effective no later than at the time of the Completion.
VI) Standstill on collection of the 2004 Bond - In order to facilitate the Restructuring, the Loan Trustee is instructed not to take action to declare the 2004 Bond in default or pursue collection until the earlier of: (i) unless the Bondholders' Meeting in all of the Loans have approved the Restructuring, 30 November 2009; and (ii) 31 January 2010. For greater certainty, if the Restructuring is approved at the Bondholders' Meeting and Completion occurs prior to 31 January 2010, then the principal balance which is not converted into Common Shares as set out above and all accrued and unpaid interest up to and including the date of Completion on the 2004 Bond will be rolled into the New Bond which will have a maturity date of 30 September 2012. Interest shall accrue on both the principal balance outstanding and on the amount of the accrued but unpaid interest as of 27 October 2009 in accordance with section 9 (Interest) of the Loan Agreement for the 2004 Bond.
VII) Standstill on collection of interest on the 2005 Bond and the 2009 Bond - In order to facilitate the Restructuring, the Loan Trustee is instructed not to take action to collect payment of interest on the 2005 Bond and the 2009 Bond due on 1 December 2009 or pursue collection until the earlier of: (i) unless the Bondholders' Meeting in all of the Loans

have approved the Restructuring, 30 November 2009; and (ii) 31 January 2010.

After 1 December for so long as the interest payment is not made, interest shall accrue on such amount of interest in accordance with section 9 (Interest) of the Loan Agreement for the 2005 Bond and the 2009 Bond, respectively.
VIII) Conditions - The Restructuring is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions precedent:
a. either the approval of the Restructuring by the Bondholders in each of the four Loans and Intex, or the adoption of a plan of arrangement or other statutory procedure under Canadian or Yukon Territory law that would accomplish the Restructuring;

e. the Completion occurring no later than 31 January 2010.

4. Evaluation of the proposed changes
4.1. The Borrower's evaluation
The Borrower continuously evaluates its cash flow and the ability to meet its obligations as they become due. As a result of delays in moving towards full production capacity at the LEFA gold mine in Guinea arising from the poor condition of the plant and the mining equipment and political instability in Guinea, among other things, the Board of Directors of the Borrower determined it to be in the best interests of the Borrower to attempt to reduce the Borrower's financial leverage. As a result, the Borrower initiated discussions with certain of the principal Bondholders to explore opportunities for a restructuring of the Borrower's debt. Based on feedback from the Arranger and the Borrower's largest shareholder, it became evident to the Board of Directors that raising any new

7

Nw wOwR.rSmK,stcTeI.nLoLITSMANN ASA
a proposed restructuring in August 2009 which included a conversion into the Borrower's common shares of approximately USD 148 million principal amount of the Loans and a rights offering, pursuant to which the Borrower proposed to issue subscription rights to holders of common shares to purchase up to 90 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of NOK 90 million. This proposal was approved by the holders of the 2005 Bonds, 2009 Bonds, and the 2006 Bonds, but was rejected by the holders of the 2004 Bonds at a meeting held on September 1, 2009.
Following this meeting, the Board of Directors continued to explore strategic and structural alternatives to improve the Borrower's balance sheet and create a viable capital structure for the Borrower which attempted to align the interests of all stakeholders and attempted to ensure that the Borrower is in a position to meet its obligations as the become due, both in the near and long term. On 12 October 2009, the Borrower provided revised production guidance to the end of the year, announced the need for significant capital expenditures to meet more reliable production rates and announced an anticipated reduction in its proven and probable reserves at LEFA. On 27 October 2009, the USD 23.2 million principal payment came due on the 2004 Bonds, which to date remains unpaid as the Borrower conserves cash for working capital and necessary capital expenditure purposes.
In approving the Restructuring, the Board of Directors considered all factors which it deemed relevant, including, without limitation, the following:
· The Borrower is not presently in a position to make the required principal and interest payments under the Loans and maintain sufficient working capital for operations and necessary capital expenditures.
· The Borrower's current level of debt, the current state of operations at LEFA, the need for significant additional capital expenditures and the political instability in Guinea, make it extremely difficult for the Borrower to raise equity to repay principal and interest on the Bonds when due and maintain sufficient working capital for operations and necessary capital expenditures.
· The Restructuring should improve the Borrower's financial strength and liquidity, which will allow the Borrower to continue to develop the LEFA gold mine.
Assuming the Borrower meets its forecast production levels and the price of the gold remains relatively constant, the Borrower believes that the Restructuring will place the Borrower in a position to meet its obligations as they become due and allow it to explore various strategic alternatives to enhance value for all stakeholders, including shareholders and bondholders.
4.2. The Arranger's evaluation
See Exhibit 1 for the Arranger's assessment of the Restructuring and the implications on the Borrower's capital structure and potential returns.
Neither the Borrower nor any of its directors and officers have assisted with or otherwise been involved in the preparation of the Arranger's assessment attached as Exhibit 1 hereto, and neither the Borrower nor any of its directors or officers assumes any responsibility for the accuracy of the Arranger's assessment or the accuracy of any information or projections included therein. The Borrower expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever with respect to any information or projections included in the Arranger's assessment.

www. irustfc.no

Certain information contained in the Arranger's assessment may constitute "forward-looking information" or "forward-looking statements". Forward-looking information or statements include, but are not limited, information or statements with respect to the projected financial condition, results or operations or business condition of the Borrower. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of the Borrower to be materially different from the historical results or from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, (1) the actual results of current exploration activities, (2) conclusions of economic evaluations, (3) changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, (4) possible variations in grade and ore densities or recovery rates, (5) failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated, (6) accidents, labour disputes and other risks of the mining industry, (7) delays in obtaining government approvals or financing or in completion of development or construction activities, and (8) risks and uncertainties existing in world capital markets generally.

4.3. The Loan Trustee's evaluation
In the opinion of the Loan Trustee the Borrower needs to strengthen its balance and solidity in order to be able to meet its obligations and challenges going forward, and we have been informed by the Borrower that the proposed restructuring is a result of preceding negotiations with certain Bondholders in all the Loans.

The request is put forward to the Bondholders without further evaluation or recommendations from the Loan Trustee. The Bondholders must independently evaluate whether the proposed changes are acceptable.

It is recommended that the Bondholders seek counsel from their own financial, legal and tax advisers as to the possible consequences of the proposal.

The Bondholders meeting irrevocably grants the Loan Trustee a power o f attorney, on their behalf, to enter into or execute any agreement, instrument or other document, and to take any and all such other act that may be required to carry out the decisions made by the Bondholders ' meeting and to accomplish the Restructuring under the laws o f Norway, Canada and the Yukon Territory, including a power o f attorney as the Bondholders' authorized representative and attorney in fact to execute an instrument o fproxy to exercise all votes held by the Bondholders to approve a plan o f arrangement or other statutory procedure under Canadian or Yukon Territory law in order to accomplish the Restructuring. The Bondholders also grant the Loan

Trustee the authority, on behalf o f the Bondholders, to agree to any minor adjustments (not being material to the Bondholders ' interest) to the Restructuring and the conditions precedent for the Restructuring.
-oOoAccording to the Loan Agreements, the abovementioned proposals require a qualified majority of 2/3 of the relevant Loans represented at the Bondholders' meeting voting in favour of such Restructuring and a minimum of 2/10 of each of the outstanding Loans being represented at the meeting. Bondholders may be represented in person or by proxy. Please find attached as Exhibit 2 a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' meeting. (If the Bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm: (i) the owner of the Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered). The individual Bondholder may authorize the Loan Trustee to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorizing the Loan Trustee to vote, must then be returned to the Loan Trustee in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further contact details). In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, such proof of ownership of the Bonds as the Loan Trustee may require. For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy, to notify the Loan Trustee by telephone or by e-mail (at set out at the first page of this letter) by no later than 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) on the Banicing Day before the meeting takes place.
Yours Sincerely, Norsk Tillitsmann ASA

Basis for financial analysis

Outlook/comments released 12-Sept-09 in press release:
· Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at end of September 2009 of USD 8.4m
· Q4 2009 production of between 50-65koz
· 15,000 tonnes per day ("TPD" ) reliable production
· 18,000 TPD achievable in long term provided significant capex is undertaken over the next 3 years

Arctic has performed a Free Cash Flow analysis of CRU based on publicly available information and CRU's stated guidance. We have, inter alia, based our forecasts on CRU' s outlook/guidance, as well as consensus financials of CRU and consensus/forward gold prices
We have focused our analysis on the time period from Q4 2009 to Q3 2012, as all of CRU's proposed revised debt repayments are due at that time
Specifically, our key assumptions are:
· LEFA focused; no income effects from either Nalunaq/Nugget Pond nor Maco
· Base case gold price of USD 1,000/oz
· Production rates at Lefa in Q4 2009 of 58,000/oz, increasing to full run rate of ca 280,000 in Q4 2010 (in line with 18,000 TPD)
· Average long run total cash costs at Lefa of ca USD 550/oz
· Ore average grade of 1.45/t at a recovery rate of 91%, in line with Q2 2009 report
· Debt service flows (interest payments and repayments of bonds as per transaction proposal)
· No further significant advance payments to the Government of Guinea
· No provisions made for PMC contracts termination payments, nor any provisions made for NGM (Nalunaq Gold Mine) closure or care and maintenance costs
· Receipt of net cash proceeds from sale of assets as made public by CRU
