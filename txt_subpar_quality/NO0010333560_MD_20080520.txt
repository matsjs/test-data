Re. Interest Payment due March 2008
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (NT) is the appointed Loan Trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the above mentioned bond issues (the "Bond Issues") in which Thule Drilling ASA ("Thule") is the issuer.
We refer to our notices in which we informed that Thule was not able to meet the interest payment in March in a timely manner. Thule and the Loan Trustee have agreed to extend the grace period until Wednesday 21 May 2008 for both Bond Issues. The board and management of Thule and its advisers are working closely with the Loan Trustee and our advisers to evaluate the situation. These discussions are positive in the spirit of mutual cooperation, and these discussions will continue in the extended grace period. Further information will be given as soon as possible.
Kind regards, Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
