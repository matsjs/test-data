ISIN NO 001 0304686 8.50 per cent Club Cruise Entertainment & Travelling Services Europe B.V. Bond Issue 2006/2011 with Call Option

Oslo, 20 October 2008
Summons to Bondholders' Meetings
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as Bond Trustee for the above mentioned Bond issues.
The Issuer has informed the Bond Trustee that, due to their liquidity situation, it is unlikely that the Issuer will be able to meet its obligations regarding the short terms liability. The Issuer therefore requests the Bondholders to postpone installments due in 2009 for both the Bond issues.
For the Bond with ISIN NO 001 0304686 this means (i) to postpone the 1/5 part o f the Remaining Loan installment due 8 March 2009 to the Maturity Date, and (ii) postpone interest payment due 8 March 2009 to 8 May 2009 (however, default interest will be paid for this period).
For the Bond with ISIN NO 001 0315310 this means to postpone the NOK 20,000,000 installment due 1 June 2009 to the Maturity Date. Interest is scheduled to be paid on time at 1 June 2009.
Based on the results as reported for Q2 2008 and the following additional information: Sales of the "MV Flamenco I" for US$ 12,500,000, resulting in a loss of approx.  9,500,000 Lay-up of MV Van Gogh (November. 2008 thru April 2009 ) Periodical capex on vessels in Q4 2008 of about EUR 3,000,000,Unavailability of regular finance facilities
The company is forced to request the restructure of its debt in order to be able to maintain its operations in a sound manner, and to obtain additional funds. Without this restructuring the company will possibly be in default of various contractual requirements. Postponing the two installment repayments (and one interest payment) is a condition to obtain additional necessary funds.

Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and o f the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting. (If the bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the bonds are registered.)
The individual bondholder may authorise the Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Norsk Tillitsmann to vote, must then be returned to Norsk Tillitsmann in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page o f this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof o f the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to Norsk Tillitsmann, to notify Norsk Tillitsmann by telephone or by e-mail (at set out at the first page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
