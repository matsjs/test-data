ISIN: NO 001 036425.0 -11.0 per cent Cecon ASA Senior Secured Callable and Putable Bond Issue 2007/2012

Oslo, 22 February 2008
Change of Borrower - Notice to Bondholders
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is appointed as loan trustee (the "Loan Trustee") for the above mentioned loan agreement (the "Loan Agreement") where Cecon ASA ("Cecon") is the borrower.
On 11 February 2008 a Bondholders' meeting (the "Bondholders' Meeting") adopted a proposed Change o f Borrower. As from 21 February 2008, Cecon Shipping 1 AS (Norwegian Company No 991789677) ("Ceon 1") shall be the new borrower and Cecon shall be the guarantor.
Cecon 1 assumes all rights and obligations under the Loan Agreement (as amended) and simultaneously Cecon is released from any and all obligations thereunder as borrower. However, Cecon remains fully liable for the obligations under the Loan Agreement as new guarantor instead of borrower as under the previous structure.
Further, the Bondholders' Meeting also sanctioned that Cecon 1 may, without any further approval from the Bondholders, complete a demerger and thereby separate the hulls/Vessels in two companies (the "Demerger"), after which Cecon 1 and Cecon Shipping 2 AS (Norwegian Company No. 991789650) shall be joint and several co-borrowers. The Demerger has not been completed, but will be carried out in the further.

Yours sincerely

T*.T
