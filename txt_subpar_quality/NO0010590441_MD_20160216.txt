Havila Shipping ASA : Insufficient support for revised Restructuring Proposal within 15th February 2016
Reference is made to the press release issued by Havila Shipping ASA (the "Company") on the 12 February 2016.
The Master Agreement entered into by and between the Company and the banks was subject to conditions subsequent to be fulfilled within 15 February 2016.
Despite substantial support from bondholders, the revised restructuring proposal was not supported by the required 2/3 majority of holders of the unsecured bonds and the Company was not able to fulfill the conditions under the Master Agreement within 15 February 2016
The Company remains in a challenging position, and will immediately work with its financial creditors in order to reach a standstill agreement. While these discussions are ongoing the Company has decided to halt payments of interest and amortization to all of its finance providers. The Company's bank lenders have indicated support for a standstill agreement and corresponding summons to bondholder meetings are expected to be announced shortly.
In anticipation of the successful outcome of the discussions with the finance providers, the Company remains fully committed to maintaining all its operations, upholding the highest level of service to all its customers and continue to pay all its trade creditors.
As the proposal to bondholders is contingent on the Master Agreement, the Company will also withdraw the summons to bondholder
