ISIN: NO 001 0650401 - 20 per cent EOAL Cyprus Holdings Limited Super Senior Secured NO 001 0655517 Callable Bond Issue 2012/2013 NO 001 0669245

Oslo, 11 March 2013

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") acts as loan trustee for the following series of bonds issued by EOAL Cyprus Holdings Limited: (a) 20.00% Super Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2012/2013 (the "Existing New Bonds" and holders thereof the "Existing New Bondholders") and (b) 15.00% Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2011/2014 (the "Existing Original Bonds" and holders thereof the "Existing Original Bondholders", and together with the Existing New Bonds, the "Existing Bonds" and holders thereof the "Existing Bondholders").

1.2 The Existing Bonds are subject to an intercreditor agreement dated 20 June 2012 (the "ICA"), pursuant to which the Existing New Bonds rank in priority to the Existing Original Bonds. In addition, the ICA provides that the Existing New Bondholders may instruct the Loan Trustee (in its capacity as bond trustee of the Existing New Bonds) to enforce the security granted for the Existing New Bonds and the Existing Original Bonds, and that in the event of a conflict between enforcement instructions provided by the Existing Original Bondholders and the Existing New Bondholders, the latter shall prevail.

2.

ACCELERATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING BONDS

2.1 Recent valuations of the ARV1 vessel (IMO 7816874) ("ARV1") demonstrated that the Existing Bondholders' security was worth less than the amount outstanding with respect to the Existing New Bonds and, as such, in an enforcement scenario, the Existing Original Bondholders would receive no recoveries.

2.2 The Existing Original Bonds were subject to a standstill arrangement with respect to the Equinox group; however on 27 February 2013, and as instructed to do so by the requisite number of Existing Original Bondholders, the Loan Trustee terminated the standstill and accelerated the Existing Original Bonds. The Existing New Bonds were subsequently accelerated on 28 February 2013.

2.3 On 1 March 2013 the ARV1 was arrested in the port of Gibraltar and on the same day the Loan Trustee filed an application for an order from the Gibraltar court (the "Court") to sell ARV1 on the Admiralty Marshal's standard terms and conditions of sale to a Cayman Islands company named Highclere Limited ("Highclere"). On 6 March 2013, the Court gave judgment on the Loan Trustee's claim and ordered ARV1 be sold to Highclere for the fair market value o f ARV1 based on two independent, expert valuations. On 7 March 2013, the

Court confirmed that Highclere had successfully acquired ARV1 free of all liens, encumbrances and debts.

HIGHCLERE BONDS

3.1 Highclere is a wholly owned subsidiary of another Cayman Islands entity called Highclere Holdings Limited (the "H ighclere Issuer" and together with Highclere, the "H ighclere G roup"). A majority in value of the Existing New Bondholders provided the Highclere Group with sufficient funds, via the issue of the Highclere Holdings Limited Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2013/2015 (the "H ighclere B onds"), in order for Highclere to purchase ARV1 for fair market value via the Gibraltarian law private treaty sale as described above, and to provide sufficient working capital to Highclere Group for a period of at least 9 months.

3.2 The Existing New Bondholders that participated in the funding of the Highclere Group (i.e. the holders of Highclere Bonds) own the entire share capital of Highclere Issuer pro rata to their respective holdings of Highclere Bonds.

4.

INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HIGHCLERE BONDS

In order to ensure that all Existing New Bondholders are offered the opportunity to participate in the funding and structuring of the Highclere Group through the Highclere Bonds, all Existing New Bondholders, who have not already subscribed for Highclere Bonds are invited by the Highclere Issuer to participate in the funding of the Highclere Group. Such invitation will be open for a period o f ten (10) Business Days from the date of this notice.
