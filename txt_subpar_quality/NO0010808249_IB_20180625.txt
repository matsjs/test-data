Closing of CrediCare acquisition
25 June 2018 - Further to the announcement dated 17 January 2018, Melin Medical AS (Melin Medical), a wholly owned subsidiary of HI Bidco AS, has today closed the agreement to acquire 100 percent of the shares in CrediCare AS (CrediCare).
CrediCare is an established provider of payment solutions and administration systems in the Norwegian market, and the acquisition gives Melin Medical access to industry segments the company is not present in today, including fitness centres and veterinary offices. Additionally, it further strengthens Melin Medical's position within the healthcare industry. CrediCare has more than 700 clinics across different industries in its customer portfolio.
Melin Medical has acquired 100 percent of the shares in CrediCare for a cash consideration of NOK 150 million, based on an estimated enterprise value of NOK 140 million and a net cash position of NOK 10 million. The acquisition is funded by a NOK 100 million subordinated shareholder loan to HI Bidco AS from HI Midco AS and NOK 60 million from HI Bidco AS' revolving credit facility, which is now fully drawn. The NOK 100 million subordinated shareholder loan is due later than the maturity of the outstanding bonds and there are no cash payments related to interest or amortization.
