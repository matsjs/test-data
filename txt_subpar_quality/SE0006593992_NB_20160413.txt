Notice from Written Procedure
On 24 March 2016, a bondholder's meeting was announced, by way of procedure in writing, regarding an amendment of the terms and conditions of the bonds. The procedure was concluded on 12 April 2016 due to the proposal receiving votes in favour by an amount exceeding the requisite majority of the Adjusted Nominal Amount. The proposed resolution obtained 98.56% of the votes and the proposal was thus adopted according to the voting requirements of the Terms and Conditions. The Terms and Conditions will therefore be amended as set out in the notice to the written procedure.
Yours sincerely
