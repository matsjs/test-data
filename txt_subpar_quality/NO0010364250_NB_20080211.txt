Oslo, 11 February 2008
Change of Borrower - Notice from Bondholders' Meeting

On 11 February 2008 a Bondholders' meeting was held pursuant to summons of 31 January 2008 regarding change of borrower.

There were sufficient Bondholders present at the meeting to form a quorum. The proposed resolution obtained 100 % of the votes, and the proposal was adopted according to the voting requirements of the Bond Agreement. The Bond Agreement will therefore be changed as follows:

1. The position o f borrower under the bond loan agreement is transferred from Cecon to (1) Cecon 1 (2) (if applicable) Cecon 1 and Cecon 2 asjoint and several borrowers (co-borrowers). The new borrower/co-borrowers (as the case may be) resume(s) full responsibility for any amount already drawn and any new amounts to be drawn under the Loan Agreement. In line with this the Escrow Account should be transferred to one or both o f the co-borrowers.

For the avoidance o f doubt, until the two hulls/Vessels are separated in two companies, Cecon 1 shall be the only borrower. However, Cecon 1 may without any further approval from the Bondholders separate the hulls/Vessels in two companies, after which there shall be two co borrowers.

2. Cecon shall execute a parent company on demand guarantee in favour o f Norsk Tillitsmann ASA on behalf o f the bond holders guaranteeing all obligations o f the co-borrowers under the Loan Agreement. Thus, Cecon remains fully liable for the obligations under the Loan Agreement as new guarantor, instead o f borrower as under the previous structure.

3. The Security will be maintained however with logical adjustments such as pledges and assignments with regards to assets to be transferred to Cecon 2 will be granted by Cecon 2.

The Bondholders may obtain a copy of the minutes from the meeting by a request to Norsk Tillitsmann ASA.

Yours sincerely

NORSK TILLITSMANN ASA
