NORSK TILLITSMANN
NORWEGIAN TRUSTEE
To the bondholders in: ISIN: NO 001039578.3 - 10.85 % PetroMena ASA Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue
2007/2010 (the "10.85% Bond Loan")
Oslo, 6 November 2013
Prolonged maturity date. Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") is appointed as loan trustee for the holders of bonds (the "Bondholders") in the above mentioned bond loan. The maturity date for the 10.85% Bond Loan was initially, and in accordance with the loan agreement, registered with the Norwegian Security Depositary ("VPS") to be on 19 November 2010. The maturity date has later (as registered with VPS) been adjusted to 19 November 2013 (the "Present Maturity Date"). As the Bondholders are informed of was the entire 10.85% Bond Loan on 3 April 2009 declared to be in default and due for immediate payment. Following the acceleration of the loan the Bondholders have received several payments. There will however not be made any payments to the Bondholders on the Present Maturity Date. As there is expected that further payments will be made to the Bondholders in the time ahead the maturity date in VPS will - purely for practical reasons - be prolonged by 1 year - until 19 November 2014 (the "New Maturity Date"). In addition to facilitate future payments to the Bondholders the extension of the maturity date will make trading and transactions connected to the bonds easier. When the New Maturity Date is approaching the Bondholders may receive a notice from VPS. An extension of the New Maturity Date will be considered on that point in time. Bondholders requesting further information may contact Norsk Tillitsmann ASA.
Kind regards Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
