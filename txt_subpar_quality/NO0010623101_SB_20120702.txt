BACKGROUND

On 6th March 2012 Troll signed a contract with BP for its multi-functional support rig Troll Solution ("Troll Solution" or the "Rig"). The Rig will be employed at the Southern Gas Asset in the North Sea, located offshore Humberside, UK.

The charter is for one plus one year with a rig rate of USD 110,300 per day and demonstrates the acceptance in the market for Troll. The scope of work is for field support service and accommodation for the entire Southern Gas Asset and includes work alongside several platforms. The first assignment for Troll Solution is at the West Sole Bravo Platform, a Well Head platform, for well intervention and coiled tubing operations. This assignment is at the very core of what the vessel is designed for and is a valuable reference for further marketing of the Rig going forward.

On 9th May 2012, the Rig commenced its journey to the North Sea - on back of the heavy-lift vessel the Black Marlin - with Rotterdam as port of destination. During the dry-tow a maintenance crew of 13 people are kept on-board to undertake preparations for operations. The Black Marlin arrived in Rotterdam on June 21, 2012.

After finalization of upgrades and commissioning of the Rig to take place in July/August 2012, the Rig will be on contract from August 31, 2012.

Troll Solution was acquired in August 2011 for USD 100.5 million financed through an equity issue of USD 50 million and the Bond Issue. Following the contract award by BP on the Southern Gas Asset in the North Sea, a strategic investment decision was taken by the Company to upgrade the Rig to be in compliance with the North Sea standard and market requirements including UK Safety Case. The upgrade cost of which most will be activated will enhance the rig value and the attractiveness and marketability of the Rig and is expected to create higher day rates for future contracts.

The most recent valuation report conducted by Kennedy Marr dated 8 June 2012 indicates a market value of Troll Solution to be in the USD 155 - 160 million range.

The upgrades done on the Rig include: ® Extended living quarter with a new accommodation module with 20 new cabins available for client use · Four-berth cabins been re-allocated for use as two-berth cabins · Control system for jacking gears upgraded with encoders on all 54 gears and new software. All gears inspected and 8 new gears replaced · Installation of new gangway · Upgraded fire and gas system and VMS system

Since the contract was awarded in March 2012, BP has decided to divest the Southern Gas Asset. The asset has been acquired by Perenco which already has a large brown field presence in the Southern North Sea. Perenco is in the market for more similar support vessels for their existing portfolio outside the Southern Gas Asset. For the current contract the contractual party to the Company in the future will be Perenco.

As a consequence of upgrading costs to North Sea specifications in accordance with the BP contract and a later startup of operations than initially budgeted, the Company will be requiring additional funding amounting to USD 20 million before entering into operations.

After reviewing various funding alternatives, the Company has decided to seek the bondholders' approval to increase the existing Bond Issue by USD 20 million in combination with certain

amendments to the existing Bond Agreement including, inter alia, a postponement of the USD 4 million installment due 19 August 2012. The additional funding combined with the postponement of the installment will provide the Company with sufficient liquidity to finance the upgrade cost and to provide necessary working capital until the revenue starts to be generated according to the contract.
