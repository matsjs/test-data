Financials
Total net revenues for the nine months period ended September 30 2016 were 532 MNOK, up 39% from 2015. The growth in revenues come partly from the acquisition of Nansen representing NOK 108m of the total net revenues for the period. Excluding Nansen the organic growth in net revenues were 43 MNOK equal to 11%.
The EBITDA for the nine months period ended September 30 2016 came in at 30.9 MNOK, compared to 15.0 MNOK for the same period in 2015. Nansen represents 19.9 MNOK of the EBITDA. Reported EBITDA includes 14.0 MNOK in non-recurring cost, mainly related to the Nansen transaction and restructuring costs related to StudioNoc. Adjusted for non-recurring cost, EBITDA for the period is 44.9 MNOK.
Outlook
We expect the positive development to continue. The focus is now to utilize NOA's Nordic digital capabilities as efficient as possible and be ready for further growth across the region.

Note 6 Seasonality
Historically we have seen a higher activity level in Q3 and Q4 compared to Q1 and Q2. The main factors explaining this are the higher number of marketing campaigns that typically are run by our clients in Q3 and Q4, and the fact that Q3 and Q4 in total have more hours available for client deliveries.
