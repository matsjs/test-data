Q3 2015 Update from the board of directors

Financial performance Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its subsidiaries, hereafter "the Group" experienced a stable Q3 2015. Challenging markets wherein the Group operates however still demand intensive focus. Revenue developments were as expected both on testing services and surveys. Overall EBITDA is in line with expectations.
The overall sales of the group showed a slight decrease of 2.2% vs Q3 2014. On YTD basis sales increased by 0.9%. Testing volumes YTD show a stable performance in comparison to prior year and survey volumes continue to show strong growth.
Costs (adjusted for post-acquisition related costs) of the Group in Q3 2015 were 9.4% lower then Q3 2014 (YTD 2.6%) reflecting amongst others the impact of the USD-EUR rate on our Europe cost base. As a result the Group's Q3 2015 EBITDA increased to USD 3,606 thousand (2014: USD 2,918 thousand).

The Group closed Q3 2015 financials with a net profit of USD 386 thousand (2014: net loss of USD 100 thousand).
Both exceptional items and capital expenditures are significantly lower then last year reflecting the ending of carve out activities and leading to increase in cash.

Explanatory notes to condensed consolidated interim financial statements

1. Reporting entity
Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. is a company domiciled in The Netherlands. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as at and for the nine months ended 30 September 2015 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The Group primarily provides testing and survey services to the Maritime industry.
2. Basis of accounting
This condensed consolidated interim financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim financial reporting. It does not include all the information required for a complete set of IFRS financial statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant for an understanding of the changes in the Group's financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014.
This condensed consolidated interim financial statement was authorised for issue by the Company's Board of Management on 27 November 2015.

3. Use of judgments and estimates
In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant judgements made by management in applying the group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014.
4. Restatement of 2014 quarterly reports
The results presented here for the period ending 30 September 2014 are different from what was published last year. The 2014 quarterly results were prepared with the best knowledge available at that time but in the course of 2014 better insight has developed as a result of amongst others PPA valuation, set up of IFRS reporting and annual closing 2014. The 2014 quarterly results have been changed accordingly for comparison purposes. An overview of the differences is presented below.

9. Net finance costs
The change in net finance costs is mainly caused by the borrowing structure of the Group, partly offset by an increase of currency exchange results and amortised costs for the bond loan. Starting 2015 the financing related foreign currency results and effect of valuation of the bond against amortised cost are recorded in net finance cost. The net finance costs of the Group is as follows.

10. Subsequent events
In October 2015 the Company bought back bonds for the total amount of USD 1.4 million as part of ordinary liquidity management.
