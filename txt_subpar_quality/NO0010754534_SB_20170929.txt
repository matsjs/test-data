In accordance with Section 3-3a of the Norwegian Accounting Act, we hereby confirm the assumption of going concern. The assumption is based on first half year 2017 status and The Group's long-term strategic forecasts for the years ahead. The Group has a solid financial position.
Future development
Warehousing, logistics and industrial buildings - The demand for new and modern logistic properties are good and the demand expects to keep strong going forward. The Group has signed new lease agreements for construction of approximately 20,400 m2during first half year 2017. Bulk is also involved in zoning and development of new logistics locations, both alone and in partnerships. The transaction market for commercial property has been good in the first half year 2017. We have experienced an improvement in the lending from finance institutions; we expect low interest rates to keep high demand for new modern logistics and warehouse properties with long cash flow.
Data Centers - It is a strong national and international interest in the data center projects. It is an ongoing process with public authorities, investors and both new and existing tenants.

The construction and letting of the first data center is ongoing.
Fiber networks - Dark fiber between Oslo and Kristiansand and onwards to the continent is completed. This makes OS-IX and N01 Campus directly connected to the global networks and tier 1 Carriers.
Report on the annual accounts
Total income for The Group was NOK 109.0 million compared to NOK 76.0 million first half year last year. This is an increase of NOK 33.0 million mainly related to higher multiple sales of underlying properties in first half year 2017 and the acquisition of Data Center Technology AS (DCT). NOK 60.4 million of total income is generated from Logistics in first half year 2017, compared to NOK 52.1 million first half year last year. The Service area generates a total income of NOK 48.6 million in the first half 2017, compared to NOK 22.4 million first half 2016. The increase in the service area is mainly due to the acquisition of DCT in May 2016. Profit for the first half 2017 was NOK 50.1 million compared to NOK 12.1 million first half 2016.

The Group's operating profit was NOK 66.1 million in 2017 compared to NOK 26.3 million first half 2016, while the annual net profit adjusted for minority interests was NOK 18.8 million in first half 2017, an increase from NOK 0.0 million in first half 2016. 8ulk Logistics contributes with a profit before tax for the first half 2017 of NOK 81.3, compared to NOK 35.8 million first half 2016.
Total current assets was NOK 545.5 million as of June 30, 2017 compared to NOK 144.1 million as of June 30, 2016. The increase is due to increased cash and cash equivalents in addition to development property of NOK 379.2 million reclassified to inventory as of June 30, 2017.
The Group's total liabilities amounted to NOK 917.7 million as of June 30, 2017, compared to NOK 597.5 million as of June 30, 2016. This increase is mainly due to financing of new projects.
Other financial and interest costs amounted to NOK 25.0 million in first half 2017 compared to NOK 16.6 million in first half 2016. The Group aims to reduce these costs significantly by strengthening its equity.
Total assets at the end of the first half 2017 amounted to NOK 1,507.5 million compared to NOK 1,075.9 million last year. The equity-to-assets ratio as of June 30, 2017 was 39.1 %, compared to 44.0 % as of June 30, 2016.
The Group's financial position is strong
Research and development
The group has no material research and development project. However, the parent company has an internal project related operating management platform (OMP) and Bulk also participates in Sintef project HighEFF - Energy Efficient and Competitive Industry for the Future.
Financial risk
The Group is exposed to these types of risk: Liquidity risk - The Group intends to have sufficient liquidity to meet all its obligations, including the new investments that are ongoing. The Group intends to maintain a reasonable amount of liquidity to meet unforeseen obligations. Interest risk - The Group has loans with a number of financial institutions, all with long-term repayment plans. The Group is exposed to changes in NIBOR interest rates and SWAP interest.
Credit risk - The Group's warehouse and distribution properties are characterized by high standards, good locations, long lease agreements and reliable tenants. There was no credit loss in first half year 2017. The Group's tenants normally pay quarterly and in advance. The lease agreements usually require an additional form of collateral or security.
Market risk
The transaction market for commercial properties - Demand for commercial real estate in Norway is currently high. Particularly properties with long-term lease agreements and low rental fees are attractive. Demand is expected to keep strong as long the interest rates remain low. There has been a slowdown in the lending from the banks in Norway due to slower growth in the residential market. This could in turn affect the transaction market going forward.
Rental Market for warehouses, logistic buildings and data centers. The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in lease/rental prices in the market. Fluctuations in unemployment and inflation affect the Group. The Group has several long-term lease agreements in place. However, the weighted average lease term for tenants has decreased from 8.3 year last year to 7.5 years as of June 30, 2017 as some lease contracts with shorter duration has been entered during first half year 2017. The lease agreements

provide The Group with fixed and predictable revenues throughout the contract period. Most lease agreements are adjusted annually 100 % in line with the consumer price index. The rate of vacancy in buildings is very low.
Subsequent events
Bulk has in June 2017 signed an agreement for sale of a portfolio of approximately 31.100 sqm of warehouse properties and approximately 71.400 sqm of land with a non-disclosed buyer. The properties are expected to be handed over during Q4 2017.
