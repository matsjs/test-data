To Bondholders in:
ISIN: NO 001031608.6 -9.75 per cent Petromena ASA Callable Bond Issue 2006/2012 (the "NOKm 2,000 Bond Issue"),
Oslo, 22 January 2009
Information to Bondholders
Reference is made to the Notice from Bondholders' Meeting on 16th January 2009 and the Summons Letter as of 19th December 2008. The Bondholders' meeting on 16th January 2009 approved among others to introduce a new USD tranche in the Loan. The Summons Letter said that those Bondholders' who (on a voluntary basis) want to switch into a USD tranche may do so on 23rd January 2009 at the valid rate o f exchange on such date. Because the Resolution on the Bondholders' Meeting was made subject to a separate Subsequent Agreement which must be in place within 30 January 2009, the date that bondholders may switch into USD tranche must be postponed correspondingly. The new date will be disclosed in a letter from the Loan Trustee on 30th January (subject to an agreement is reached on the Subsequent Agreement).

Yours sincerely Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
Jo Forfang
