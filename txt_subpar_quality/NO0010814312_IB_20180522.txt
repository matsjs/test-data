DIRECTORS REPORT 2017 SG BIDCO AS
Nature of B usiness and B u sin e ss Location S G Bidco A S w as established in January 2015. The objective of the Com pany is to own shares in subsidiaries and to make investments, direct or indirect, in b usinesses operating within training and evaluation of maritime and other personnel and similar businesses, and hold shares in businesses with similar operations. The establishment of the Com pany is a direct consequence of the fact that Herkules Private Equity Fund IV, Alplnvest and the Management of the Seagull operation have acquired all the shares in Eagle Holdco A S including subsidiaries. The shares have been acquired via S G Holdco A S (ultimate Holding Company), S G Midco A S (Holding Company) and S G Bidco AS. The Com pany is located in Horten.
The fully owned subsidiary Seagull Maritime A S manufacture and sell system s for training and evaluation of seafarers based on a distribution agreement with its holding com pany Seagull A S. In addition, Seagull Maritime A S holds subsidiaries in Singapore (Seagull Maritime Information Technology Pte Ltd), Newcastle Upon Tyne, U K (Seagull Maritime Information Technology Ltd), Germ any (Seagull Maritime Information Techn. Gmbh), Tokyo, Japan (Seagull KK), Hong Kong (Seagull Maritime Information Technology Ltd) and branch offices in Piraeus, Greece and Gdynia, Poland.
The fully owned subsidiary Seagull Oil & G a s A S manufacture and sell system s for training and evaluation of personnel, mainly within the Oil & G a s sector. In addition, Seagull Oil & G a s is the sole holder of the shares in Extek A S, located at Bryne, Norway.
The G ro u p 's deliveries to customers are mainly done by Seagull Maritime A S in Horten, but increasingly also done by the subsidiary in Singapore. Seagull A S outsources all development of technology and content to the subsidiaries Seagull Maritime A S and Seagull Oil & G a s A S. To perform this operation, Seagull Maritime A S and Seagull Oil & G a s do in addition to own operating activities, outsource a significant load of research- and development work to their partner Green-Jakobsen, Manila, Philippines.
Despite the turbulent market conditions the last few years, the Group has experienced a positive development, confirmed by the growth in operating revenues. Custom ers have to som e extent cancelled contracts or parts of contracts due to ships going out of operation, but the growth in sales to new customers and additional sales to existing customers have more than compensated for this.
1

Resulting from the fact that a significant part of the G ro u p 's operating revenues are denominated in U SD , the Group is exposed to currency fluctuations accordingly. In order to eliminate as much a s possible of this risk, the Group has established a hedging strategy securing the bulk of its U S D cash flow by selling U S D forward.
Going Concern In compliance with Section 3-3a of the Norwegian Accounting Act, it is hereby confirmed that the going concern assum ptions continue to apply.
The Group has during 2017 invested heavily in further development of the Training Library and the Software System s for training administration and evaluation of seafarers.
The Group is in a healthy economic and financial position.
Future Development The market conditions within the shipping industry give indications of som e improvements towards the end of the year, but som e shipping segm ents do still experience poor rates and are still struggling with profitability. Despite this fact, the G rou p 's growth in order intake has continued during 2017. The main reason for this is that the G ro u p 's products represent a cost effective training solution for seafarers compared to traditional training. In addition we see positive effects related to the fact that sales resources recruited the last couple of years to strengthen the sales team, start producing better results as they have been better incorporated into their respective markets. In total, the B o D expects the Group to follow on a continued upward trend in the years to come.
Com m ents to the Financial Statements The G ro u p 's operating revenues in 2017 were K N O K 202 428 versus K N O K 199 695 in 2016. Operating profit in the sam e period ended at K N O K 11 185 compared to K N O K 4 548 in 2016. Net profit w as K N O K 19 112 versus K N O K 1 371 in 2016. Operating profit in S G Bidco A S w as negative with K N O K -62 479 compared to K N O K 62 417 negative in 2016.
The losses in the Holding Com pany is to a large extent caused by amortization of intangibles and unrealized currency losses related to the long term bank loans denominated in U SD .
The G ro u p 's net cash flow from operations ended at K N O K 58 110 in 2017 compared to K N O K 43 390 the year before. C ash and equivalents at year end 2017 were K N O K 14 127. The G rou p's financial position by year end, and its ability to fund the operation going forward, is good.
2

Total assets in the Group w as K N O K 1 026 419 versus K N O K 1 023 282 by the end of 2016. The equity ratio per 31.12.2017 w as 4 7 .8 % compared to 4 6 .0 % in 2016.
It is the B o D 's opinion that the Annual Financial Statements for the Parent Com pany and the Group have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and that the information presented gives a true picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and overall results a s of December 31st 2017.
Financial Risk and Risk management The Group is exposed to financial risk in various areas, especially risk related to currency fluctuations due to the fact that more than 8 0 % of the G rou p's revenue is denominated in U SD . The B o D is keen to minimize this risk as much as possible and has therefore changed the strategy and extended the use of hedging contracts.
A considerable part of the forecasted net U S D cash flow for the period 2018 to 2020 is based on this policy secured through these U S D forward sale contracts.
Credit Risk Historically, the Group has had minor losses on receivables caused by custom er's lack of ability to fulfill their payment obligations. The G rou p 's total Accounts Receivable ended at K N O K 75 028 at year end 2017. C aused by the G ro u p 's increasing market shares and revenue, it is likely that the exposure against customers in parts of the world where the credit risk statistically is higher, will increase a s well. The B oD and Group Management is monitoring this closely on a continuing basis.
The subsidiary Seagull Maritime A S has not entered into any agreement with counterclaims or any other financial instruments to minimize the credit risk.
Liquidity Risk. The Group holds considerable amounts of cash and equivalents. Resulting from this, the liquidity risk is deemed to be low. Payment terms on customer contracts remains unchanged.
Management do on a continuing basis focus on improvement of supplier contracts to improve prices and payment terms.
Market risk Se e note 17 in the Annual Accounts.
Staff and Working Environment S G Bidco A S had zero employees during and at the end of 2017. The Group employed 136 staff by year end, of which 41 were females.

Notes to the Accounts for 2017

Accounting Policies
The Annual Accounts hve been prepared in accordance with the Norwegian Generally Accepted Accounting principles.
Use of estimates The preparation of the accounts are in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Acts regulations regarding use of eatimates. In addition, the accounting principles requires Management to exercise judgements .The areas where significant judgements and estimates have been made are disclosed in the note specifications.
Shares in Subsidiaries and Associated Companies
Subsidiaries are defined as companies where the Holding Company has control, and by that controlling influence on the entity's financial and operational strategy, normally by holding more than 5 0 % of the voting rights. Investements where the Holding Company controls 20-50% of the shares and have considerable influence are defined as associated companies.
List of Group Companies at 31.12.2017: Parent and Subsidiaries: S G Bidco A S (Parent) Seagull A S (Subsidiary) Seagull Maritime A S (Subsidiary of Seagull A S) Seagull Oil & Gas A S (Subsidiary of Seagull A S) Seagull Maritime Information Technology Pte Ltd; "Seagull Singapore" (Subsidiary of Seagull Maritime AS) Seagull Maritime Information Technology Ltd; "Seagull UK" (Subsidiary of Seagull Maritime A S) Seagull KK; "Seagull Japan" (Subsidiary of Seagull Maritime A S) Seagull Maritime Information Technology Gmbh; "Seagull Germany" (Subsidiary of Seagull Maritime A S) Extek A S (Subsidiary of Seagull Oil & G as A S)
The shares in Extek A S were acquired on August 22nd 2015.
Accounting Principles for Shares in Subsidiaries and Associated Companies
Subsidiaries and Associated Companies are measured at their fair value at the date of the aquisition in the Holding Com pany's accounts. The fair value is adjusted when funds are added through capital increases, or when Group contributions are given. Distributions to the Holding Company, like for instance Dividends, are booked in the P&L. Distributions that exceed retained earnings post acquisition are booked as reduction of the book value of the shares. Dividend and Group Contribution from subsidiaries are accounted for in the same year as it is recognized in the subsidiary. Dividend from others is booked among financial items when adopted.
In the Group accounts, the equity method is used for investments in associated companies. Use of this method means that the book value in the balance sheet equals the relevant share of the equity in the associated company, adjusted for any remaining excess values from the acquisition and unrealized intragroup profits. The profit share in the P&L is calculated on basis of the share of the profit after tax in the associated company, adjusted for any depreciation of excess values or unrealized profits. Any profit share from associated companies are included as finacial items in the P&L.

SG BIDCO AS

Notes to the Accounts for 2017

Consolidation Principles Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
In the Group accounts book value of shares in subsidiaries are replaced by the subsidiary's assets and liabilities. The Group accounts are prepared and presented as if the Group was one entity. All intragroup transactions, unrealised intragroup profits and intragroup receivables and payables are eliminated.
Subsidiaries acquired are accounted for based on the Parent's acquisition cost. Acquisition cost is assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities which are accounted for in the Group accounts at fair value at the date of the acquisition. Added value that cannot be allocated to identified assets or liabilities are recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is treated as a residual and is capitalised in the balance sheet based on the value observed when the transaction took place. Added values in the Group accounts are depreciated over the expected lifetime of the acquired assets.
Assets and liabilities in foreign operations are translated into N O K at the rate of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies are translated at the average currency rate for the year. Any significant transaction in foreign currency is translated into N O K at the rate on the transaction date. Foreign currency translation differences are booked direct against Group equity.
Revenue Recognition principles Revenues from sales of goods and services are recognized at the fair value of the contract, adjusted for VAT, returns and discounts. Revenue from sale of goods is recognized when goods are delivered to the customer and all contractual obligations have been fulfilled. Delivery is regarded complete when goods are shipped to the customer's address and the risk for loss or obsolescence is transfered to the customer. Provision for volume discounts and returns are made based on previous experience. Warranty provisons are expensed and booked against liability provisions.
Revenue for services provided are recognized incrementally as the service is performed.
Classification of Balance Sheet Items Assets related to normal operating cycles for goods and services as well as assets falling due within 12 months are classified as current assets, other assets are classified as non-current. Correspondingly, liabilities related to normal operating cycles for goods and services or that are due within 12 months are classified as current liabilities. Other liabilities are classified as non-current. Installments related to long-term receivables and debt that fall due next 12 months are nevertheless classisfied as non-current.
Acquisition Cost Acquistion cost for assets is calculated based on the purchase price for the asset, adjusted for any bonuses and discounts. Other purchase cost like freight, customs, non-refundable taxes etc are added to the acquisiton cost. Purchases in foreign currencies are accounted for based on the FX-rate at the transaction date or at the hedging rate when forward contracts are being used.
Acquisition cost for fixed assets is the purchase price adjusted for expenses directly related to make the asset ready for use, like for instance expenses related to test of the asset.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill The difference between the acquisition cost by purchase and fair value of the identified asset is classified as goodwill, and depreciated over the expected lifetime of the asset.
Expenses related to research and development activities are capitalized if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, and the Group has adequate resources to complete the development. In all other cases, research and development work is expensed on a continuous basis. Capitalized R&D is depreciated linearly over its expected lifetime.

Notes to the Accounts for 2017

Fixed Assets Other fixed assets are capitalized and depreciated linearly over the expected lifetime of the asset. Maintenance of fixed assets is expensed on a continuous basis. Expenses that are expected to generate future economic benefits from the assets are recognized in the balance sheet and depreciated in line with the asset.
Leased equipment is capitalized in the balance sheet as fixed assets if the lease agreement is regarded a financial lease.
Other Long Term Share Investments
Investments in other shares are capitalized at their cost. Profit distributions or dividends are normally booked as financial income when the distribution is adopted. If the profit distribution significantly exceeds the Group's share of retained earnings post acquisition, the excess value is booked as a reduction in the acquisition cost of the shares.
Impairment of Fixed Assets If there are indications that the carrying amount of an asset is lower than its book value, recoverable amounts are calculated.The test is carried out for the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows. If the balance sheet value exceeds both sales value and recoverable value, the book value is reduced to the higher of sales- and recoverable value. Previous impairment losses are, except for goodwill, reversed limited to the carrying value the asset would have had after depreciation or amortization.
Inventories Inventories are valued to the lowest of acquisition cost and net selling price. Net selling price is estimated selling price in the ordinary cause of business adjusted for estimated cost of completion, marketing and distribution. Only indirect cost is regarded required to sell finished goods. For work in progress, direct manufacturing cost is added as well.
Receivables Accounts Receivables are measured at their nominal value, adjusted for potential losses. Provisions for losses are made based on an individual assessm ent of the receivable and an additional provision to cover other foreseeable losses. Financial challenges among customers, risk of bankrupcy and delays with payments are regarded indicators of need for write-off.
Other receivables, both short- and long term, are accounted for at the lowest of face value and fair value. Fair value is calculated as the net present value of future cash-flows. This is not done when the effect on the accounts is regarded as immaterial. Provision for losses are calculated based on the same principles as for accounts receivable.
Foreign Currencies
Receivables and debt in foreign currencies are, if not hedged, booked in the balance sheet at the exchange rate at year end. Currency gains- and losses from sales and purchase of goods in foreign currencies are accounted for as revenue and cost of goods.
Hedging Contracts The Group has a policy to limit currency risks through hedging of parts of projected future cash-flows in foreign currencies (cash-flow hedging). In the accounts, the contracts are regarded hedging instruments and value changes are continuously accounted for in the P&L.
Liabilities Liabilities, with the exception for some provisions, are booked at nominal value.

SG BIDCO AS

Notes to the Accounts for 2017

Pensions The Group has a defined contribution scheme plan, deposits are made with an insurance company. The Group has no additional payment obligations after the deposits have been made. Contributions are recognized as expenses when they occur. Any prepaid deposits are booked in the balance sheet as assets (pension funds) to the extent that they can be refunded or be deducted from future contributions.
Taxes Income tax expense in the financial statements includes tax payable and changes in deferred taxes in the period. Deferred tax is calculated based on temporary differences between between the accounting- and tax value of assets and liabilities and any tax forwardable deficits by year end. Tax-increasing temporary differences adjusted for deductible temporary tax-reducing temporary differences that reverse or can be reversed in the same period are offset. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differeneces can be utilised. Deferred tax and tax advantage that can be capitalized are offset in the balance sheet.
Tax reductions from group contributions and tax from group contributions received that are booked as a reduction in capitalized value of the shares in the subsidiary, are booked directly against tax provisons in the balance sheet (against tax payable if the group contribution affects payable tax, and against deferred tax if the group contribution affects deferred taxes). Deferred taxes are booked at nominal value both in the Holding Company and the Group accounts.
Cash-flow statement
The cash-flow statement is prepared based on the indirect method. Cash and equivalents comprise cash, bank deposits and other short-term deposits that immediately and with immaterial currency risk,can be converted into a given sum of money, with a maturity of three months or less.
Mergers To achieve a more rational organization of the Group, it has been decided with effect from June 17th 2015, to merge the wholly owned subsidiary Eagle Holdco A S with the holding company S G Bidco A S as acquiring company. From an accounting perspective this was done in line with the group continuity regulations. The value of assets and liabilities from Eagle Holdco A S are booked with the same amount in the acquiring company with the same value as in the Group accounts.

Note 17 Market Developm ent and key num bers
The demanding market conditions have continued into and during 2017, with poor rates and extreme downturn in key shipping segments. This has resulted in high pressure on pricing, and stronger focus on scope reductions among our customers. Despite these tough market conditions, the Group has achieved increases in order intake versus previous year, with growth both in number of installations and the Portfolio of subscribing customers. The level of terminations from customers does in addition show a slight decrease compared to the level in 2016.
The rate development in key shipping segments has slightly increased towards the end of 2017, and are expected to rebound further into 2018.

Uavhengig revisors beretning
Til generalforsamlingen i SG Bidco AS
Uttalelse om revisjonen av årsregnskapet
Konklusjon Vi har revidert SG Bidco AS' årsregnskap som består av:
· selskapsregnskapet, som består av balanse per 31. desember 2017, resultatregnskap og kontantstrømoppstilling for regnskapsåret avsluttet per denne datoen og noter, herunder et sammendrag av viktige regnskapsprinsipper, og
· konsernregnskapet, som består av balanse per 31. desember 2017, resultatregnskap og kontantstrømoppstilling for regnskapsåret avsluttet per denne datoen og noter, herunder et sammendrag av viktige regnskapsprinsipper.
Etter vår mening:
· er årsregnskapet avgitt i samsvar med lov og forskrifter
· gir selskapsregnskapet et rettvisende bilde av den finansielle stillingen til SG Bidco AS per 31. desember 2017 og av selskapets resultater og kontantstrømmer for regnskapsåret som ble avsluttet per denne datoen i samsvar med regnskapslovens regler og god regnskapsskikk i Norge.
· gir konsernregnskapet et rettvisende bilde av den finansielle stillingen til konsernet SG Bidco AS per 31. desember 2017 og av konsernets resultater og kontantstrømmer for regnskapsåret som ble avsluttet per denne datoen i samsvar med regnskapslovens regler og god regnskapsskikk i Norge.
Grunnlag for konklusjonen Vi har gjennomført revisjonen i samsvar med lov, forskrift og god revisjonsskikk i Norge, herunder de internasjonale revisjonsstandardene International Standards on Auditing (ISAene). Våre oppgaver og plikter i henhold til disse standardene er beskrevet i Revisors oppgaver og plikter ved revisjon av årsregnskapet. Vi er uavhengige av selskapet slik det kreves i lov og forskrift, og har overholdt våre øvrige etiske forpliktelser i samsvar med disse kravene. Etter vår oppfatning er innhentet revisjonsbevis tilstrekkelig og hensiktsmessig som grunnlag for vår konklusjon.
Annen informasjon Ledelsen er ansvarlig for annen informasjon. Annen informasjon består av årsberetningen.
Vår uttalelse om revisjonen av årsregnskapet dekker ikke annen informasjon, og vi attesterer ikke den andre informasjonen.

Uavhengig revisors beretning 2017 SG Bidco AS - Side 1 av 4

IB P O
I forbindelse med revisjonen av årsregnskapet er det vår oppgave å lese annen informasjon med det formål å vurdere hvorvidt det foreligger vesentlig inkonsistens mellom annen informasjon og årsregnskapet, kunnskap vi har opparbeidet oss under revisjonen, eller hvorvidt den tilsynelatende inneholder vesentlig feilinformasjon.
Dersom vi konkluderer med at den andre informasjonen inneholder vesentlig feilinformasjon er vi pålagt å rapportere det. Vi har ingenting å rapportere i så henseende.
Styrets ansvar for årsregnskapet Styret (ledelsen) er ansvarlig for å utarbeide årsregnskapet i samsvar med lov og forskrifter, herunder for at det gir et rettvisende bilde i samsvar med regnskapslovens regler og god regnskapsskikk i Norge. Ledelsen er også ansvarlig for slik intern kontroll som den finner nødvendig for å kunne utarbeide et årsregnskap som ikke inneholder vesentlig feilinformasjon, verken som følge av misligheter eller utilsiktede feil.
Ved utarbeidelsen av årsregnskapet er ledelsen ansvarlig for å ta standpunkt til selskapets og konsernets evne til fortsatt drift, og på tilbørlig måte å opplyse om forhold av betydning for fortsatt drift. Forutsetningen om fortsatt drift skal legges til grunn for årsregnskapet så lenge det ikke er sannsynlig at virksomheten vil bli avviklet.
Revisors oppgaver og plikter ved revisjonen av årsregnskapet Vårt mål med revisjonen er å oppnå betryggende sikkerhet for at årsregnskapet som helhet ikke inneholder vesentlig feilinformasjon, verken som følge av misligheter eller utilsiktede feil, og å avgi en revisjonsberetning som inneholder vår konklusjon. Betryggende sikkerhet er en høy grad av sikkerhet, men ingen garanti for at en revisjon utført i samsvar med lov, forskrift og god revisjonsskikk i Norge, herunder ISA-ene, alltid vil avdekke vesentlig feilinformasjon som eksisterer. Feilinformasjon kan oppstå som følge av misligheter eller utilsiktede feil. Feilinformasjon blir vurdert som vesentlig dersom den enkeltvis eller samlet med rimelighet kan forventes å påvirke økonomiske beslutninger som brukerne foretar basert på årsregnskapet.
Som del av en revisjon i samsvar med lov, forskrift og god revisjonsskikk i Norge, herunder ISA-ene, utøver vi profesjonelt skjønn og utviser profesjonell skepsis gjennom hele revisjonen. I tillegg:
· identifiserer og anslår vi risikoen for vesentlig feilinformasjon i regnskapet, enten det skyldes misligheter eller utilsiktede feil. Vi utformer og gjennomfører revisjonshandlinger for å håndtere slike risikoer, og innhenter revisjonsbevis som er tilstrekkelig og hensiktsmessig som grunnlag for vår konklusjon. Risikoen for at vesentlig feilinformasjon som følge av misligheter ikke blir avdekket, er høyere enn for feilinformasjon som skyldes utilsiktede feil, siden misligheter kan innebære samarbeid, forfalskning, bevisste utelatelser, uriktige fremstillinger eller overstyring av intern kontroll.
· opparbeider vi oss en forståelse av den interne kontroll som er relevant for revisjonen, for å utforme revisjonshandlinger som er hensiktsmessige etter
Uavhengig revisors beretning 2017 SG Bidco AS - Side 2 av 4

IB D O
omstendighetene, men ikke for å gi uttrykk for en mening om effektiviteten av selskapets og konsernets interne kontroll.
· evaluerer vi om de anvendte regnskapsprinsippene er hensiktsmessige og om regnskapsestimatene og tilhørende noteopplysninger utarbeidet av ledelsen er rimelige.
· konkluderer vi på hensiktsmessigheten av ledelsens bruk av fortsatt driftforutsetningen ved avleggelsen av regnskapet, basert på innhentede revisjonsbevis, og hvorvidt det foreligger vesentlig usikkerhet knyttet til hendelser eller forhold som kan skape tvil av betydning om selskapets og konsernets evne til fortsatt drift. Dersom vi konkluderer med at det eksisterer vesentlig usikkerhet, kreves det at vi i revisjonsberetningen henleder oppmerksomheten på tilleggsopplysningene i regnskapet, eller, dersom slike tilleggsopplysninger ikke er tilstrekkelige, at vi modifiserer vår konklusjon om årsregnskapet og årsberetningen. Våre konklusjoner er basert på revisjonsbevis innhentet inntil datoen for revisjonsberetningen. Etterfølgende hendelser eller forhold kan imidlertid medføre at selskapet og konsernet ikke fortsetter driften.
· evaluerer vi den samlede presentasjonen, strukturen og innholdet, inkludert tilleggsopplysningene, og hvorvidt årsregnskapet representerer de underliggende transaksjonene og hendelsene på en måte som gir et rettvisende bilde.
· innhenter vi tilstrekkelig og hensiktsmessig revisjonsbevis vedrørende den finansielle informasjonen til enhetene eller forretningsområdene i konsernet for å kunne gi uttrykk for en mening om det konsoliderte regnskapet. Vi er ansvarlige for å lede, følge opp og gjennomføre konsernrevisjonen. Vi alene er ansvarlige for vår revisjonskonklusjon.
Vi kommuniserer med styret blant annet om det planlagte omfanget av revisjonen og til hvilken tid revisjonsarbeidet skal utføres. Vi utveksler også informasjon om forhold av betydning som vi har avdekket i løpet av revisjonen, herunder om eventuelle svakheter av betydning i den interne kontrollen.
Uttalelse om øvrige lovmessige krav
Konklusjon om årsberetningen Basert på vår revisjon av årsregnskapet som beskrevet ovenfor, mener vi at opplysningene i årsberetningen om årsregnskapet, forutsetningen om fortsatt drift og forslaget til anvendelse av overskuddet er konsistente med årsregnskapet og i samsvar med lov og forskrifter.
Konklusjon om registrering og dokumentasjon Basert på vår revisjon av årsregnskapet som beskrevet ovenfor, og kontrollhandlinger vi har funnet nødvendig i henhold til internasjonal standard for attestasjonsoppdrag (ISAE) 3000 «Attestasjonsoppdrag som ikke er revisjon eller forenklet revisorkontroll av historisk finansiell informasjon», mener vi at ledelsen har oppfylt sin plikt til å sørge for ordentlig og

Independent Auditor's Report
To the General Meeting of SG Bidco AS
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion We have audited the financial statements of SG Bidco AS. The financial statements comprise:
· The financial statements of the parent company, which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2017, and the income statement and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, and
· The financial statements of the group, which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2017, and the income statement and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion:
· The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the law and regulations.
· The accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the parent company as at 31 December 2017, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway.
· The accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group as at 31 December 2017, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway.
Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company and the Group as required by laws and regulations, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Other information Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Board of Directors' report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the Financial Statements The Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation in accordance with law and regulations, including fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. The financial statements use the going concern basis of accounting insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise will cease operations.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive

to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Company's and the Group's internal control.
· evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
· conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
· evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
· obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
Opinion on the Board of Directors' report Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Board of Directors' report concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption, and the proposal for the allocation of the profit is consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations.

Opinion on Registration and Documentation Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have considered necessary in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, it is our opinion that management has fulfilled its duty to produce a proper and clearly set out registration and documentation of the Company and the Group's accounting information in accordance with the law and bookkeeping standards and practices generally accepted in Norway.
