Ability Drilling has decided to file bankruptcy petition

Ability Drilling has decided to file bankruptqy petition

Ability Drilling has today decided to file a

bankruptcy petition to

Nordhordaland Tingrett on Wednesday morning

before opening of the

stock exchange. The board considers that sale

of assets will not be

sufficient to cover liabilities. This is a

consequence of TTS Sense

AS (TTS) failure to meet its obligations to deliver

rigs according to

contract, or perform contractual guarantee work.

Ability Drilling has

tried to sell rigs, however TTS has not been able

to confirm future

delivery of services for new customers. Thus, the

rigs has not been

saleable.

'

Ability Drilling's total claim against TTS for
inadequate deliveries amounts to NOK 293.4 million. It is the board's and the management's judgment that legal exposure of TTS' breach through a bankruptcy administrator will provide creditors and shareholders with a better

chance of regaining values than continued operations. The board and the management will be at the disposal of the bankruptcy administrator.
It has not been possible for Ability Drilling to raise capital, as the rigs are not functioning, and as TTS can not meet delivery deadlines and will not provide service or guarantee work on the rigs according to contracts.
For further information, please contact:
CEO Hans Petter Eikeland, phone +47 56 32 43 43, or +47 93 20 81 77 Chairman of teh board, Geir Nordahl-Pedersen, phone +47 56 32 43 43, or +47 90 14 01 30
