REPORT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER 2018

CLEMENS KRAFT
Fridtjof Nansens plass 6 0160 OSLO

Operations
Throughout Norway, the production from small hydro power plants in the Clemens Kraftverk group were challenged by an extraordinary cold winter season. The seasonal close down due to freezing on the dam intakes and rivers lasted significantly longer than historical average.
Operating revenues for the first quarter was 1.7 million kroner and the EBITDA for the group was minus 8.9 million kroner. The net result for the first quarter was minus 14.9 million kroner.
Events after the reporting period
The melting season has turned out satisfying. Sound production volumes have been recorded. Power prices have been strong in April in May. In addition, all the producing plants of the Clemens Kraftverk group qualify for elcertificates. By end of May, the spot price on elcertificates has incrased about 200% from the start of 2018. In total, such combination may provide the basis for solid earnings in the second quarter.
