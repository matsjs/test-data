Q4 2016 Update from the board of directors
Financial performance

Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its subsidiaries, hereafter "the Group", closed a relatively good quarter showing continuous price pressure, but also first signs of a growing contract base for testing services and solid growth for quantity services.

The Group closed 2016 with a net loss of USD 1,463 thousand (2015: net profit of USD 404 thousand). Excluding the exceptional expenses the net result shows a profit of USD 1,609 thousand in 2016 (2015: net profit of 1,939 thousand).

As a result of continuous focus on cost efficiencies, the expenses decreased to USD 8,432 thousand (Q4 2015: 9,131 thousand). The Group's Q4 EBITDA decreased to USD 3,253 thousand in comparison to prior year (Q4 2015: USD 3,692 thousand), but showed an improvement compared to Q3 2016 (USD 3,170 thousand).
All figures are presented in accordance with the amended bond agreement (the Q4 and YTD 2015 figures are restated). The exceptional expenses are reflecting, amongst others, the impact of the cost reduction programs.

The operating cash flow of 2016 was USD 3,492 thousand positive. The operating cash flow in comparison to prior year is impacted by an increase in exceptional expenses, a temporary increase in working capital and lower operational performance.
Organizational changes No change have occurred within the board of directors of the Group in Q4 2016.

and for the year ended 31 December 2015.
4. Restatement of 2015 quarterly reports
The results presented for the period ending 31 December 2015 are different from what was published last year. The 2015 quarterly results were prepared with the best knowledge available at that time but in the course of 2015 better insight has developed as a result of amongst others compliance with IFRS reporting and annual closing 2015. Moreover in January 2017 the bond agreement has been amended. The 2015 quarterly results have been changed accordingly for comparison purposes. An overview of the differences is presented below.

9. Net finance costs
The change in net finance costs is mainly caused by the borrowing structure of the Group. The decreased finance costs is caused by the gains resulted from the bond buy-back which is offset by the currency exchange results and shareholder interest costs. Starting 2016 the interest income bond buy-back concerns the income in interest as result of the bond buy back in 2015 and Q1 2016. The net finance costs of the Group is as follows.

10. Subsequent events
There have been no subsequent events between the period ending 31 December 2016 and the release for publication of these consolidated interim financial statements on 28 February 2017 except for the fact that in January 2017 the bond agreement has been amended.
