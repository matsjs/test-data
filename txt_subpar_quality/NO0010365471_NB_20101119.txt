Notice from Bondholders' Meeting
On 19 November 2010 a Bondholders' meeting was held pursuant to summons of 11 November 2010.
There were sufficient Bondholders present at the meeting to form a quorum. The proposed resolution obtained 64.95 % of the votes, which, according to the voting requirements of the Bond Agreement, was not sufficient for adoption. Prior to the meeting, the Borrower made certain changes to the proposal, and some of the votes were cast in favor conditional upon those revisions to the proposal. The Bond Agreement will remain unchanged.
