Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the printing date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of the voting rights at the bondholders' meeting. (If the Bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the Bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the Bonds are registered.)
The individual Bondholder may authorise Norsk Tillitsmann to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising Norsk Tillitsmann to vote, must then be returned to Norsk Tillitsmann in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post - please see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the Bond Trustee accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to Norsk Tillitsmann, to notify Norsk
Tillitsmann by telephone or by e-mail (at set out at the first page of this letter) within 16:00 hours (4 pm) (Oslo time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.

Rotterdam, the 22nd of August 2009
Fairstar has successfully arranged a $15million 4 year, second mortgage facility with Fortis Bank in Rotterdam. The Loan Agreement has been signed and a copy has been provided to the Trustee for verification. The availability of new capital in the banking market continues to be challenging. Furthermore, both of Fairstar's main competitors have been aggressively discounting freight rates in order to acquire new business. Therefore, Fairstar considers it prudent and in the best interests of the company to preserve and build up its cash liquidity. By extending the final maturity of the NOK Bond repayment by 5 months, Fairstar can retire the bond principal in its entirety, continue to make the quarterly principal repayments required under its long-term Loan Agreement with HSH Nordbank and have enough cash to finance ongoing operations. Fairstar recognizes that there must be an appropriate cost made to account for the additional time requested for the NOK Bond redemption and this proposal reflects Fairstar's good faith offer to its Bondholders.
Kind regards,
Philip Adkins CEO
