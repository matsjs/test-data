To the bondholders in:
ISIN: N0001054567.6 - 11.50 per cent Aladdin Oil & Gas Company ASA Callable Bond Issue 2009/2012
Oslo, 14 April 2010
INFORMATION TO BONDHOLDERS - EX COUPON DATE - BLOCKING OF TRADE
Reference is made to the proposed financial restructuring which was adopted by the Bondholders Meeting on 18 March 2010. The details of the restructuring are described more closely in the summons to Bondholders' meeting dated 1 March 2010. There is a delay in the fulfilment of the Conditions Precedent, and implementation of the restructuring, which will cause interference with the ex coupon date for the Interest Payment.
The Loan originally has an Interest Payment Date on 2 May 2010. The ex coupon date for that interest payment is 18 April 2010.
If the restructuring is implemented, there will not be any interest payment on 2 May 2010, the Interest Payment Date shall, as described in the summons dated 1 March 2010, be moved from 2 May 2010 to 2 November 2010, and the ex coupon date shall accordingly be moved to (on or about) 19 October 2010.
Further, if the restructuring is implemented, the restructuring implies an adjustment of the Coupon and an alternative compensation of accrued interest.
It is anticipated that the Conditions Precedent for the restructuring, at the earliest may be fulfilled on or about the 23 April 2010.
Consequently, Bondholders should be advised that there will be a period where the ex coupon date will be unclarified, and the accrued interest matter is unclarified. The Bonds will consequently be blocked for trade until the situation regarding the implementation of the restructuring is clear.
