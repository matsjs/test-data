UPDATE ON COMPLETION OF VALIANT AGREEMENT AND BOND REPAYMENT
Reference is made to stock exchange notification dated 19 March where Rocksource ASA (Rocksource or Company) announced an asset transaction with Valiant Petroleum (Valiant).
As stated in the 19 March announcement the transaction was subject to certain conditions, including Norwegian government approvals. All conditions precedent have now been lifted with the exception of the formal government approval. The approval is expected shortly.
As previously stated by the Company, Rocksource will upon completion of the Valiant transaction be in a position to immediately repay the remaining outstanding RGT 01 bond (the "Bond"). The Bond matured on 4 May 2012, and the five day grace period in the loan agreement expired 11 May. Rocksource has a good dialogue with the Norwegian Trustee (Norsk Tillitsmann), who is the representative of all bondholders.
Rocksource will publish a confirmatory stock exchange announcement upon final completion of the transaction and repayment of the Bond.
