To holders of bonds in N00010548373 NOK 1,000,000,000 Fixed Rate Note Storebrand Boligkreditt Covered Bond 2009/2019 (Extendable to 28 October 2020)
Oslo, 31 August 2011
Change of interest rate in potential extension period Pursuant to the loan agreement, Norsk Tillitsmann ASA is the VPS trustee for the above loan. The Borrower has informed us that the Final Terms erroneously state that the interest rate on the loan will be fixed for the duration of the potential extension period 28 October 2019 - 28 October 2020. In actual fact, however, as is the standard market practise for this type of loan, a floating interest rate was agreed for the aforementioned period. Unfortunately was this not taken into account when the Final Terms were prepared. The interest rate in the potential extension period will be three-month NIBOR + 0.45 % p.a. Please contact Norsk Tillitsmann ASA or Storebrand Boligkreditt AS if you would like a signed copy of the Final Terms showing the required amendment.
Sincerely yours Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
