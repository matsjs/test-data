To the bondholders (the "Bondholders") in:

ISIN: NO 001 0506728 -25 % CECON ASA Secured Bond Issue 2009/2010

Information to Bondholders - Extension of Grace Period

Oslo, 6 May 2010

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM" or the "Trustee") acts as the loan trustee for the Bondholders in respect of the loan mentioned above (the "Loan" or the "Bonds") made available under a loan agreement dated 30 April 2009 (the "Loan Agreement") entered into between the Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) and Cecon ASA ("Cecon" or the "Borrower").

All capitalized terms used herein shall, except as otherwise defined herein or required by the context, have the meanings assigned thereto in the Loan Agreement.

According to the Loan Agreement, an interest payment was due on 30 April 2010. Accordingly, unless the Borrowers have paid the interest before the expiry of the 5 Banking Day grace period (the "Grace Period"), there will be an Event of Default under Clause 3.8.1 (a) of the Loan Agreement.

We believe that there is a reasonable prospect of obtaining support from Bondholders for a proposal in relation to a restructuring. In order to allow discussions with Bondholders to take place, and to maintain stability at the Company, we would be prepared to grant an extension to the Grace Period. We therefore confirm that, the Grace Period shall be extended, and shall not expire on 6 may 2010, until such time as we give you 2 Banking Days' written notice of the expiry of the Grace Period.

All our rights and the rights o f the Bondholders in respect o f the Bonds and the Loan Agreement are hereby reserved, the Grace Period and any other breaches or defaults which may have arisen under the Bonds.

Yours sincerely Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
