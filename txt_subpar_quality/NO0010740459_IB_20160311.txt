ISIN: N00010740467 -15.00 per cent Goliath Holding Pte. Ltd Super Callable Bond Issue 2015/2017
Oslo, 11 March 2016
Interest Payment 11 March 2016 to be capitalised
We refer to the bond agreement for the USD 220,000,000, ISIN: NO 0010740459 - 12.00 per cent Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2015/2017 (the "GOH Senior Secured Bond Agreement") between Goliath Offshore Holdings Pte. Ltd. (the "Borrower") and Nordic Trustee ASA (the "Bond Trustee"), and the USD 43,396,993, ISIN NO 0010740467 - 15.00 per cent Super Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2015/2017 (the "GOH Super Senior Bond Agreement") between GOH and the Bond Trustee (the GOH Senior Secured Bong Agreement and the GOH Super Senior Secured Bond Agreement together referred to as the "Bond Agreements").
According to Clause 9 of the Bond Agreements, the amounts to be paid on the Interest Payment Dates shall be calculated based on the amount in the Debt Service Account. There are no amounts on the Debt Service Accounts, and consequently the interest was capitalised on the Interest Payment Date 11 March 2016. As a technical matter, the coupon due 11 March 2016 was set to zero in VPS. The capitalisation was done without any payment in kind.
Yours sincerely Nordic Trustee ASA
