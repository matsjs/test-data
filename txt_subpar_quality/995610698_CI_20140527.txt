WORLD WIDE SUPPLY AS INTERIM ACCOUNTS 1st QUARTER 2014
The quarter in brief World Wide Supply AS is 100% owner of six Plattform Supply Vessels all delivered from Yard in the period from 28th June 2013 until 17th December 2013. Thus there is not any comparable figures for the previous year.
During the 1st Quarter four of World Wide Supply AS' six vessels were on Yard in Holland to prepare for the Petrobras contracts. The Vessels finished the work at the Yard at the end of February/beginning of March. After that they have operated in the spot market in the North Sea. The remaining two Vessels have been on contract with GDF in the UK sector of the North Sea.
The World Wide Supply Group's operating income for the 1st quarter was NOK 23,4 million, which reflects the off hire period due to Vessel conversions mentioned above. The EBITDA was negative with NOK 13,3 million and EBIT was negative with NOK 22 million after deduction of NOK 8,7 million in depreciation. Net financial costs was NOK 22,5 million resulting in a pre-tax loss of NOK 44,5 million.
Operations Average utilization of the fleet was 41 % for the quarter. The low utilization rate is due to that four of the Vessels were on yard from 1st January until end February/start of March. These Vessels will commence their four years contract with Petrobras in the end of 2nd quarter 2014, with options of four additional years. The last two Vessels are on a short term contract with GDF in the UK sector of the North Sea and including options they will be on this chart until 2nd quarter 2015.

Financial risks The Group uses financial instruments to manage its foreign currency risk in charter hire. The Group has fixed rate on the long-term debt so there is no risk to interest rate. The Group has an active approach to currency risk and it is entered into agreements that reduce this risk. The Group's long-term debt is in US dollars. It is signed long-term time charters for four of its vessels with rate in US dollars. Payment to the company in that currency has a cash flow that covers the interest on its long-term loan in US dollars. Therefore there is no risk associated with the payment of interest on long-term debt.
Employees The Group had at 31st March 147 employees of which 144 sailors including hired personnel.
