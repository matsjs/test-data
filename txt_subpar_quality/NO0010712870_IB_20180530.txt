UPDATE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED 31 MARCH 2018
During the first quarter of 2018, the Company continued to provide IT housing solutions to its sole customer, EVRY.
For the quarter ended 31 March 2018, the Company's operating revenues totalled NOK 22.3 million compared to an operating revenue of NOK 37.7 million reported in the same quarter last year due to a higher level of added value services in relation to construction work in the first quarter of 2017.
Operating expenses totalled NOK 7.6 million, which comprised of NOK 7.1 million of cost of goods sold, operational and management support costs; and NOK 0.5 million of personnel costs. The decrease of NOK 14.0 million in operating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter last year is mainly due to the reduction in costs relating to the provision of added value services.
