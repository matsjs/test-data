Oceanic Champion AS
Report from the Board of Directors 2016
Nature and location of business Oceanic Champion AS is a ship owning company in the Sun Atlantic Ltd group which is a ship-owner and operator in the offshore seismic segment.
The company was incorporated in February 2013 and acquired the vessel "Oceanic Champion" in April in connection with a group-refinancing. "Oceanic Champion" is employed on a longterm bareboat contract with the seismic operator CGG until 06/2020. Due to adverse market conditions in the seismic sector, the company has agreed to amend the bareboat contract by reducing charterhire payments for the remaining term. The reduced charterhire is partly compensated by the issuing of CGG bonds in favour of the company. The bonds were issued in March 2017 and sold in the market at prevailing market price for CGG assets.
To finance the acquisition of the vessel in 2013 the company secured a fixed interest USD bond loan in the amount of MUSD 70 repayable over seven years. The original repayment plan secured the loan to be repaid before the CGG contract expired. The amended contract terms allowed an extraordinary repayment of the loan with about MUSD 5 subsequent to the sale of CGG bonds in the market. Going forward the loan will be repaid in line with the company's earnings. Upon expiry of the contract the estimated loan balance is about MUSD 0,6.
The main office is at Austevollshella in Austevoll Municipality. Oceanic Champion AS is owned 100 % by the Sun Atlantic Ltd group.
Going concern The accounts have been prepared on the assumption of going-concern pursuant to Section 3-3 of the Accounting Act.
Report on the annual accounts The annual result for 2016 was MUSD -7.7 against MUSD -15.0 in 2015. The book value of the vessel at MUSD 58.7 is substantiated by the long term bareboat charter in combination with broker valuations. This year's loss is related to a new valuation of the ship in combination with the renegotiation of the bareboat contract creating an impairment charge of MUSD 10. The result is allocated from retained earnings.
Total assets as of 31.12.2016 were MUSD 69.1 (MUSD 86.1), while total equity was MUSD 26.9 (MUSD 34.6). The equity ratio is 39% (40%).
Cash and cash equivalents as of 31.12.2016 were MUSD 7.4 (MUSD 6.3), whereof MUSD 7.4 is in escrow accounts as collateral for the bond loan.
The company is taxed under the Norwegian tonnage tax system.
Working environment, personnel and equal opportunities The company had no personnel directly employed either ashore or onboard during 2016. The board consists of three men.

Oceanic Champion AS

External Environment Under the barebSM contract CGG has full responsibility for the operation of the vessel. The company hires supervision servicesjto ensure that the CGG operation is performed in compliance with the contract.

The financial statem ents com prise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2016, the income statem ent and statem ent of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a sum m ary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accom panying financial statem ents are prepared in accordance with law and regulations and give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Com pany as at 31 Decem ber 2016, and its financial perform ance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting A ct and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway.
B asis fo r Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs).

page 2 Independent auditor's report to the General Meeting of Oceanic Champion AS

In preparing the financial statem ents, m anagem ent is responsible for assessing the Com pany's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. The financial statem ents use the going concern basis of accounting insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise will cease operations.
A u d ito r's R esp o n sib ilitie s fo r the A u d it o f the Fin a n cia l Statem ents
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statem ents as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will alw ays detect a material m isstatem ent when it exists. M isstatem ents can arise from fraud or error and are considered m aterial if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), we exercise professional judgm ent and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
· identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
· obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures th at are appropriate in the circum stances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
· evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estim ates and related disclosures made by management.
· conclude on the appropriateness of m anagement's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a m aterial uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statem ents or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
· evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a m anner th at achieves fa ir presentation.
We com m unicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and tim ing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
O pinion on the Board o f D ire c to rs' re p o rt
Based on our audit of the financial statem ents as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Board o f D irectors' report concerning the financial statem ents, the going concern assumption, and the proposal for the coverage of the loss is consistent with the financial statem ents and complies with the law and regulations.
