Q4 2015 Update from the board of directors

Financial performance Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. and its subsidiaries, hereafter "the Group" experienced a good performance in Q4 2015. Markets wherein the Group operates are tough and competition is increasing. The Group however managed to maintain volumes and focused on cost saving projects resulting in an improved EBITDA in comparison to prior year.
The Q4 sales of the group showed a decrease of 2.3% vs Q4 2014 however on YTD basis sales increased by 0.1%. Total testing volumes and surveys have increased in Q4 in comparison to prior year. Price pressure on testing and FX impact resulted in lower sales in Q4 2015. Overall YTD 2015 sales increase is mainly impacted by a positive volume development.
Costs (adjusted for one-off / non-recurring items) of the Group in Q4 2015 were 7.5% lower than Q4 2014 (YTD 3.8%) reflecting amongst others the favorable FX results. As a result the Group's Q4 2015 EBITDA increased to USD 3,951 thousand (2014: USD 3,541 thousand).

The Group closed Q4 2015 financials with a net loss of USD 40 thousand (Q4 2014: net loss of USD 445 thousand) which is mainly driven by the tax charge for the year and lower operating expenses.
Both exceptional items and capital expenditures are significantly lower than last year reflecting the ending of carve out activities.
Organizational changes No changes have occurred within the board of director's of the Group up and till the date of this quarterly report. The supervisory board of VPS announced that as effective 1 October 2015 that John Notman-Watt is replaced by Thomas Klitbo as chairman in the Supervisory Board. John Notman-Watt remains a member of the Supervisory Board.

Explanatory notes to condensed consolidated interim financial statements

1. Reporting entity
Veritas Petroleum Services B.V. is a company domiciled in The Netherlands. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as at and for the twelve months ended 31 December 2015 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The Group primarily provides testing and survey services to the Maritime industry.
2. Basis of accounting
This condensed consolidated interim financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim financial reporting. It does not include all the information required for a complete set of IFRS financials statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant for an understanding of the changes in the Group's financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014.
This condensed consolidated interim financial statement was authorised for issue by the Company's Board of Management on 29 February 2016.

3. Use of judgments and estimates
In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant judgements made by management in applying the group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014.
4. Restatement of 2014 quarterly reports
The results presented here for the period ending 31 December 2014 are different from what was published last year. The 2014 quarterly results were prepared with the best knowledge available at that time but in the course of 2014 better insight has developed as a result of amongst others PPA valuation, set up of IFRS reporting and annual closing 2014. The 2014 quarterly results have been changed accordingly for comparison purposes. An overview of the differences is presented below.

The change in net finance costs is mainly caused by the borrowing structure of the Group, partly offset by an increase of currency exchange results, amortised costs for the bond loan and gains resulted from the bond buy-back. Starting 2015 the financing related foreign currency results and effect of valuation of the bond against amortised cost are recorded in net finance cost. The net finance costs of the Group is as follows.
