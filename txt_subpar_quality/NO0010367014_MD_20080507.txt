To the bondholders in:
ISIN NO 001 0367014 - 10.875% Eastern Echo Holding Pic. Senior Secured Callable and Putable Bond Issue 2007/2012
Oslo, 7 of May 2008
NOTICE OF MANDATORY REDEMPTION
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") acts as loan trustee for the existing bond issue mentioned above (the "Loan") in respect of which Eastern Echo Holding Pic. ("Eastern Echo") is the borrower. The terms and conditions of the Loan are set out in a Loan Agreement between Eastern Echo and the Loan Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) dated 2 May 2007 (the "Loan Agreement").
All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Loan Agreement unless otherwise stated.
On 6 and 16 November 2007 respectively, Schlumberger B.V. ("Schlumberger") presented public offers for the acquisition of all shares in Eastern Echo. As a result of the offers and separate purchases of Eastern Echo shares in the market, Schlumberger did on 11 December 2007 own 99% of the outstanding shares and voting rights in Eastern Echo. On this basis, Schlumberger did on 12 December 2007 resolve to effect a compulsory acquisition of the remaining minority interests in Eastern Echo, and Schlumberger does accordingly hold 100% of the Eastern Echo shares. The last day of trading of the Eastern Echo shares on Oslo Axess was 21 January 2008.
Being the sole shareholder in Eastern Echo, Schlumberger intends to restructure the Eastern Echo group and to integrate the business activities of Eastern Echo with those of the Schlumberger group. Schlumberger and Eastern Echo have therefore decided to sell all shares in all the Vessel Owning Companies out of the Eastern Echo group with effect on or about 19 June 2008. Such sale will pursuant to Clause 10.3 of the Loan Agreement trigger a Mandatory Redemption obligation for Eastern Echo and the company must therefore fully redeem the Loan at 107% of par plus accrued interest on the redeemed amount, ref. Clause 10.3 first paragraph (ii).
The redemption of the Loan and payment of accrued interest will take place on or about 19 June 2008.

Yours sincerely, Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
