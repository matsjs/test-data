To the bondholders in:
ISIN: NO 001 039598.1-3.625 per cent Seadrill Ltd Callable Convertible Bond Issue 2007/2012
Oslo, 23 November 2009
Adjustment of Conversion Price - Correction
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NT") acts as loan trustee for the above captioned bond issue, where Seadrill Ltd. (the "Borrower") is the borrower. The terms and conditions of the loan are set out in a loan agreement between the Borrower and NT dated 2 November 2007 (the "Loan Agreement"). All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Loan Agreement or in this letter.
Reference is made to the letter to the bondholders dated 19 November 2009, where we announced that the new Conversion Price was adjusted to USD 31.57. However, due to a rounding error in the calculation, this has been proven incorrect. Thus, after recalculation, the Conversion Price is adjusted according to the Loan Agreement, from USD 32.33 to USD 31.58, effective on 23 November 2009 which is the ex-dividend date.
Yours sincerely Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
