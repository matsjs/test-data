Oslo, 30 May 2013 Payment to the Bondholders
INTRODUCTION Norsk Tillitsmann ASA (the "Loan Trustee") acts as loan trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of the up to USD 20,000,000 20 per cent Super Senior Secured Callable Bond Issue 2012/2013 (the "Bonds") issued by EOAL Cyprus Holdings Limited (the "Issuer") and guaranteed by, amongst others, Equinox Offshore Accommodation Limited. The Bonds have been issued in three separate tranches with the respective ISIN numbers: ISIN NO 001 065040.1 (the "First Tranche"), ISIN NO 001 065551.7 (the "Second Tranche") and ISIN NO 001 066924.5 (the "Third Tranche"). Pursuant to a notice to the Bondholders dated 11 March 2013, the Bondholders were informed that the Bonds were accelerated on 28 February 2013 and that the vessel ARV1 (the "ARV1") was arrested in the port of Gibraltar on 1 March 2013. On 7 March 2013, the Gibraltan court confirmed that ARV1 had been sold to a company named Highclere Limited, free of all liens, encumbrances and debts and on the Admiralty Marshal's standard terms and conditions (the "ARV1 Sale"). The net proceeds from the ARV1 Sale have now been released by the Gibraltan court in accordance with the settled order o f priority under Gibraltan law. From the proceeds of the ARV1 Sale, USD 935,056.63 has been applied to repay the outstanding Bondholder Loan in accordance with its terms. The terms of the Bondholder Loan were described in the summons to the bondholders' meeting held 14 December 2012. The remaining proceeds of the ARV1 Sale received by the Loan Trustee, less the Holdback (as defined below), will be distributed to the Bondholders in accordance with the terms of the Bonds (the "Interim Distribution"). The Loan Trustee will retain USD 500,000.00 from the proceeds of the ARV1 Sale in order to cover post-distribution costs and expenses (the "Holdback"), and any remaining balance from the Holdback, and any additional recoveries generated after the Interim Distribution has been made, will be distributed to the Bondholders in due course as a final distribution.
