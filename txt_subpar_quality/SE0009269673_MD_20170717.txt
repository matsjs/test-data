 No Swedish tax should be triggered at the mergers.

Hence, it cannot be utilized up to and including 2022. The reason for the restriction is that group contributions could not be made in 2016 between the companies involved in the merger. To avoid this, the mergers cannot be carried out.
 Note 1 incurred in Step 3 between Jetpak Top Holding AB and Jetpak Holding AB will be eliminated at the merger.
