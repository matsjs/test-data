DigiPlex Rosenholm AS Notes to the Financial Statements
DigiPlex Rosenholm AS Notes to the Financial Statements
Accounting principles The financial statements for the quarter and twelve months ended 31 December 2015 have been prepared in accordance with Norwegian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (NGAAP).
Accounting policies Sales Revenues IT housing service revenues will be recognised and expensed over the designated term of each respective contract.
Classification and valuation of balance sheet items Assets intended for long term ownership or use have been classified as fixed assets. Assets relating to the trading cycle have been classified as current assets. Receivables are classified as current assets if they are to be repaid within one year after the transaction date. Similar criteria apply to liabilities. Current assets are valued at the lower of cost price and net realisable value. Short term liabilities are reflected in the balance sheet at nominal value on the establishment date.
Fixed assets are valued at purchase cost. Fixed assets whose value will deteriorate are depreciated on a straight line basis over the asset's estimated useful life. The fixed assets are written down to net realisable value if a value reduction occurs which is not believed to be temporary.

Fixed assets Fixed assets are reflected in the balance sheet and depreciated over the asset's expected useful life on a straight-line basis. Direct maintenance of an asset is expensed under operating expenses as and when it is incurred. Additions or improvements are added to the asset's cost price and depreciated together with the asset. The split between maintenance and additions/improvements is calculated in proportion to the asset's condition at the purchase date.
Debtors Trade debtors and other debtors are reflected in the balance sheet at nominal value less provisions for doubtful debts. Provisions for doubtful debts are calculated on the basis of individual assessments. In addition, for the remainder of accounts receivables outstanding balances, a general provision is carried out based on expected loss.
Foreign currencies Monetary items in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
Tax The tax charge in the income statement includes both payable taxes for the period and changes in deferred tax. Deferred tax is calculated at 25% on the basis of the temporary differences which exist between accounting and tax values, and any carry forward losses for tax purposes at the year-end. Tax enhancing or tax reducing temporary differences, which are reversed or may be reversed in the same period, have been eliminated. Deferred tax and tax benefits which may be shown in the balance sheet are presented net. The Company chose to capitalise the deferred tax advantage.
