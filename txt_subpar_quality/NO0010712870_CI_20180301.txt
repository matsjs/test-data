UPDATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
During the year 2017, the Company continued to provide IT housing solutions to its sole customer, EVRY.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Company's operating revenues totalled NOK 129.4 million, which reflects an increase of NOK 50.7 million compared to the operating revenue of NOK 78.7 million reported last year. The majority of the increase, approximately NOK 42.4 million, relates to an increase in added value services.
Operating expenses totalled NOK 68.7 million, which comprised of NOK 66.1 million of cost of goods sold, operational and management support costs; and NOK 2.6 million of personnel costs. The increase in operating expenses of NOK 34.7 million compared to last year is largely due to the costs of providing the added value services, as described above, of approximately NOK 40.6 million offset by a net decrease of NOK 5.9 million in other operating expenses.
EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation) for 2017 was NOK 60.7 million, which is 36% higher than the EBITDA reported last year.
A charge of NOK 34.3 million was made to reflect depreciation of the plant and equipment, and the Company incurred net finance costs of circa NOK 25.9 million, compared to NOK 34.6 million and NOK 28.5 million respectively last year.
In light of the above, the profit before income tax for the financial year 2017 came in at NOK 0.5 million, compared to a loss before income tax of NOK 18.4 million for 2016.
Cash generated from operations was NOK 40.4 million, compared to NOK 55.7 million last year.
Borrowings totalled NOK 497.0 million as at 31 December 2017, which reflects the Bond Issue completed in June 2014, and remains largely unchanged from year end 2016 where borrowings totalled NOK 495.0 million. Shareholder loans were reduced by NOK 32 million during the year, ending at NOK 237.1 million as of 31 December 2017.
As at 31 December 2017, cash and cash equivalents stood at NOK 11.7 million compared to NOK 39.5 million at the end of 2016.
