Njord initiates legal proceedings against the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy
In the further process of the Company's announcement dated 11 July 2013, and in response to the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy's (the `MPE') announcement of changes in the Tariff Regulation on 27 June 2013, Njord Gas Infrastructure AS (the `Company') has filed a writ of summons to initiate legal proceedings against the MPE.
In the writ of summons, the Company argues that the MPE's decision to reduce the Gassled tariffs does not have sufficient legal basis and must therefore be ruled invalid. The Company also claims compensatory damages for the loss the Company incurs as a result of the decision.
