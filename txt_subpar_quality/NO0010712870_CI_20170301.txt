UPDATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2016
In the year ended 31 December 2016 the Company successfully delivered the last two phases (each 700m2 of white space) of the data centre to EVRY AS (i.e. on 1 January 2016 and 3 March 2016), approximately one month earlier than provided for in the Agreement with EVRY.
The Company and EVRY entered into an additional agreement in this period where the Company will be compensated, throughout the term of the existing 20-year contract, for undertaking additional construction and project management work. This construction work was finalised during the half year ended 30 June 2016. The additional construction work was funded by an additional shareholder loan.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, the Company's operating revenues totalled NOK 78.7 million, an increase of NOK 41.8 million compared to last year due to the phased handover of each 700m2 totalling 4,200m2. Operating expenses totalled NOK 34.0 million, an increase of NOK 6.6 million from last year, which comprised of NOK 32.2 million of operational, management and accounting support costs and NOK 1.8 million of personnel costs.
EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortisation) for 2016 was NOK 44.7 million, compared to NOK 9.5 million last year.
A charge of NOK 34.7 million was made to reflect depreciation of the building compared to NOK 16.9 million in 2015. Net finance costs of NOK 28.5 million are reflected in the Income Statement; compared to a negligible amount in the same period last year, as construction is now complete and the capitalisation of net finance costs thereby ceased from the date of final handover on 3 March 2016.
In light of the above, the loss before income tax for the year ended 31 December 2016 came in at NOK 18.4 million, a higher loss compared to 2015, of NOK 7.6 million. This was due to an increase in depreciation and in net finance costs.
Cash generated from operations was NOK 55.7 million in 2016, compared to NOK 4.1 million in 2015.
Total long term borrowings of NOK 495.0 million at 31 December 2016 reflect the Bond Issue completed in June 2014 and remain largely unchanged from last year end's position. There were no movements in shareholder loans in the fourth quarter of 2016 with the balance remaining at NOK 269.1 million.
At 31 December 2016 cash and cash equivalents stood at NOK 39.5 million compared to NOK 48.5 million at year end 2015.
