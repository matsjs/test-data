Q3 sales reached USD 747K vs USD 808 in Q3 2011, a negative growth of 8%.
The third quarter proved to be challenging with lower growth rates across Europe and Asia outside Japan as reported for Q2. Q3 of 2012 ended at 8% weaker sales than the same quarter in 2011. July was according to plan, August was better than planned, but September proved to be very weak due to postponement of larger deals planned for closing in September. However, despite the delay in some major deals, none were lost, and management expects a good Q4. We won one major deal in the quarter relating to an environmental monitoring project for a major oil company. Revenue from this project will be booked over many quarters, and had little effect in Q3. Provided successful results are coming out of this project, management believes this may open interesting future opportunities in the oil and energy sector.
In Europe, sales were down 16% compared to Q3 in 2011. In the US, sales were down 6% over same quarter in 2011. Asia sales outside Japan were down 42% compared to last year, although in actual numbers the difference is not significant. Japan is showing steady and significant growth, this quarter Japan grew 45% over same quarter in 2011.
For the quarter, EBITDA represented a loss of USD 140 vs a loss of 186K in Q3 2011.Gross margin remains strong at 88%. YTD revenues were USD 2,740K vs USD 2,449K YTD in 2011, a growth of 12%. G&A for the quarter totalled USD 799K vs 876K in Q3 of 2011, a cost reduction of 8%. EBITDA YTD ended at -27K vs -414K for same period of 2011, i.e. a net improvement in operating profit of USD 388K. Net income for Q3 ended at -269K against 245K in Q3 2011.

Highlights for Q3 2012
· 8% lower sales over Q3 2011 · EBITDA of -140K vs -186K in Q3 of 2011 · Organizational changes in place, and new management team fully operational · As reported for Q2, several deals were delayed until later in the year, significantly impacting revenue for the quarter · Strict cost management helped save $77k over the quarter compared to 2011 · Won a consultancy contract with Statoil on a strategic environmental monitoring project · Released ADI Insight Server, an industry first process solution as part of major PAT project with ABB Group
Product Development continued work on several key products, including a new version of The Unscrambler® X for release in early 2013.
In addition, we soft launched the Unscrambler® X ADI Insight Server at ABB's global user meeting in Budapest, Hungary. ADI Insight Server is an industry first development which enables multivariate models to communicate between different instruments/analyzers and control platforms built on the OPC ADI standard. ADI Insight Server was developed as part of what will be the world's largest Process Analytical Technology (PAT) implementation, in which CAMO is providing multivariate analytical models to integrate into ABB's automation and control platform.
We also continued partnership negotiations with a number of key OEM and system vendors which are expected to come to fruition in Q4.
Management anticipate a strong Q4 when deals postponed in Q3 are closed and several new OEM partnerships are agreed.
