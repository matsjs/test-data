World Wide Supply
The quarter in brief_____________________________________________________________________________ World Wide Supply AS owns six Platform Supply Vessels. All delivered from Damen Shipyard in the period from June 28th to December 17th 2013. The Group purchased the shares in the Limited Partners with Damen in this quarter.
During the quarter two Vessels have worked in the spot market in UK sector of the North Sea up to end August/beginning of September. Four Vessels have worked for Petrobras in Brazil, but two of the vessels have received letters of termination dated 9th September.
As reported 11th September the Group is below the minimum liquidity set out in the Bond Agreement which is USD 7,5 million AS per 30.09.2015 the total liquidity was USD 5,6 million. The receivables towards Petrobras related to the period from "the blocking date" to the termination date is equivalent to USD 4 million including part in local currency (included in Other Short-term Receivables).
The Group is in dialogue with its main creditor with respect to the company's financial situation and possible actions to be implemented.
World Wide Supply Group's operating income for the third quarter was in USD, BRL and GBP equivalent to USD 7,9 million.
The EBITDA was positive with USD 1,2 million (15,6 % EBITDA margin) and EBIT was negative with USD 0,2 million after deduction of USD 1,5 million in depreciation. Net financial expenses were USD 2,7 million (of which USD 1,0 was unrealized agio) resulting in a pre-tax loss of USD 2,9 million.
The cash flow before interest corrected for charged and earlier paid import tax was positive with USD 1,6 million while interest paid on the Bond was USD 2,9 million.
Operations___________________________________________________________________________________ Average utilization of the fleet was 76,4% for the 3rdquarter and 84,7% for the first nine months of the year.
Two Vessels are on four years contract with Petrobras in Brazil until June 2018, based on yearly renewal of the CAA (Certificate of Charter Authorization) and AIT (Registration Certificate of temporary foreign Vessel). The company has received letters of termination for the two other vessels previously also on contract with Petrobras but has appealed this decision.
The remaining two Vessels have been working in the spot market in the North Sea until end of August/beginning of September and then laid up due to a very poor market situation.
Profit and loss Q3 2015__________________________________________________________________________ Operating income was equivalent to USD 7,9 million for Q3-15 (USD 12,7 million for Q3-14), while operating expenses were USD 6,7 million (USD 7,8 mill for Q3-14). Depreciation was USD 1,5 million (USD 1,5 mill for Q3-14).
Net financial expenses were USD 2,7 million (USD 12,8 million for Q3-14) including unrealized currency profit of net USD 1 million (USD 9,9 million in loss for Q3-14) related to loan granted to subsidiaries in EUR. Net result before tax for Q3-15 was negative with USD 2,9 million (negative with USD 9,3 million for Q3-14).

Profit and loss 1.1. - 30.09.2015 (1.1. - 30.09.2014)_________________________________________________ Operating income was equivalent to USD 27,1 million for the first nine months of 2015 (USD 26,5 million), while operating expenses were USD 21,4 million (USD 20,9 mill). Depreciation was USD 4,4 million (USD 4,3 mill).
Net financial expenses were USD 21,5 million (USD 16,9 million) including unrealized currency loss of net USD 11,4 million (loss of net USD 7,4 million) related to loan granted to subsidiaries in EUR. Net result before tax was negative with USD 20,2 million (negative with USD 15,6 million).
Balance sheet per 30.09.2015 (per 30.09.2014)______________________________________________________ Total assets were USD 221,7 million (USD 232,9 million).
Tangible fixed assets amounted to USD 199 million (USD 204,3 million).
Based on valuations from two independent shipbrokers at 30.09.2015 the average value of the Vessels were USD 151,5 million. The group's current assets were USD 15,1 million (USD 23,2 million) of which cash equivalents corresponded to USD 5,6 million (USD 12,7 million).
Book equity as per 30.09.2015 was USD 71,8 million based on conversion of EUR to USD at rates on delivery dates for the vessels corresponding to USD 0,47 per share, while value adjusted equity based on the shipbrokers valuations mentioned above was USD 24,3 million corresponding to USD 0,16 per share.
At the balance sheet date of 30.09.2015 the Group had long term interest bearing debt in the amount of USD 150 million.
The working capital was USD 12 million at 30.09.2015 compared to USD 17,2 million at 30.09.2014.
Market outlook_________________________________________________________________________________ Two of the four Petrobras contracts have been terminated from 9th of September but this decision is appealed by the Group. Up to date the Group has not received any reply on the complaint. The two other vessels in Brazil have performed very well and each of them achieved 100% utilization in September.
One Vessel on Loss of Hire Insurance in July and until 7thof August and then on-hire with Charterer. The remaining two Vessels have been working in the spot market in the North Sea up to end August/beginning of September, but are now laid up in Alesund, Norway.
The Board of Directors expects a very challenging market situation for the rest of 2015 as well as for 2016, and experiences a challenging situation towards Petrobras and the current situation with only two of six vessels on contract.
Due to the termination of two of the Petrobras contracts the cash flow needs to be improved by action related to achieve employment for the four other vessels, cost reduction and/or changes in the level of debt service. The financial situation of the company and possible actions to be implemented are discussed with the company's main creditor.
