PETRO PROD

To the bondholders in 10.85 per cent PetroProd Ltd Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2013

Company Update

11 December 2008

In order for you as bondholders to assess the situation in further detail, we have prepared a short update on our ongoing construction projects, as well as some more detailed information on our financial situation and budgets going forward.

1.0 Construction and markets

The CJ70 project is progressing well, according to a revised delivery date of 30 September 2010. The reason for the 3 month deferred delivery date is to bring more float in engineering progress to suit the shipyard's construction method.

As of end November, detailed engineering progress was approximately 60% complete, whilst construction progress stood at 22%. All major equipment has been purchased. Block fabrication and assembly in dock are ongoing. Spud cans are also under assembly. Leg materials delivery is according to plan.

The market balance for our target niche market on the Norwegian Continental Shelf remains favorable, where in our opinion demand exceeds the supply for the foreseeable future. We have currently provided bids for three major tenders where we see the use of a harsh environment jack-up rig of CJ70 design as the preferred solution. However, due to the financial market turmoil currently experienced, it is uncertain whether or to what extent these tenders will be concluded according to plan in the short term. We are nevertheless optimistic that a contract could be obtained within a 3-6 months perspective. We are in parallel also continuously evaluating and working with other strategic alternatives for the Rig, which may include a direct sale of the Rig, a joint venture partner or another financial solution.

The conversion of the M/T Arc is continuing according to a revised schedule, with planned completion on or about 3Q 2009, which is somewhat later than originally planned. All major equipment is complete and received on site or ready for shipment. Topside modules are complete and stored at the supplier's (GSI) Singapore yard. Currently most of the work related to the FPSO is deferred, awaiting an employment contract or another financial solution for this unit. We foresee that several announced field developments by small and independent E&P companies will be put on hold due to the financial turmoil and drop in oil prices. This indicates that our targeted FPSO market will continue to be difficult. We are currently in discussion with vendors to the project to postpone payments, which are progressing. This will affect the timing of payments and eventually the delivery date for the unit. The co-operation with the Yard is working well.

In addition to continuing the search for employment, we are currently working on two main leads for the FPSO, which involve (i) a direct sale of the unit, and (ii) a sale of the unit on the back of a contract. The first lead is given the highest probability for success of the two, although still uncertain in today's market. The latter lead will eventually take longer to accomplish with a somewhat lower probability for success.

Regarding the two aframax tankers, reference is made to the announcements made on November 27th and December 1st 2008, which confirmed the agreement to sell M/T Archimid and M/T Trust to a European buyer. The closing is expected to take place by mid December 2008. The net cash payment to PetroProd under this transaction will be USD 22 million. An upfront payment of 20% has been received as of today. This realization will however trigger a mandatory prepayment of USD 24 million of the FRN bond at 103% of par plus accrued interest on redeemed amount.

2.0 Financials

As of the date of this summons our total cash balance consisted of (i) USD 16.1 million on escrow account in favor of the Bondholders (please note that this is after payment of the December installment of USD 19.5 million on December 1st), (ii) USD 20.4 million on escrow in favor of the FRN bond, and (iii) approximately NOK 394.5 million (USD 56 million at USD:NOK 7.00) of remaining proceeds from the convertible bond, in total USD 92.5 million. Based on a revised payment schedule to vendors in the Rig and the FPSO projects, we anticipate that the liquidity will last until June 2009 before new funding will be needed (please refer to budgets below for details). In our budgets we have allocated the remaining proceeds from the convertible bond approximately as follows; (i) 2/3 for the CJ70 project and (ii) 1/3 for the FPSO project.

Per end November 2008 the remaining cost to complete the Rig was estimated to USD 350 million, while the remaining cash to complete (without allocation of proceeds from convertible bond) is estimated to USD 314.2 million1 (excluding the expected mobilization cost). The total project cost is estimated to USD 607 million. The deviation versus the initial budget of USD 560 million relates mainly to;

1USD 314.2 million = USD 349.8 million (remaining cost to complete) - USD 19.5 million (December installment paid) - USD 16.1 million (escrowed cash)

Currently most of the work related to the FPSO is deferred, awaiting an employment contract or another financial solution for the unit. The delivery date and actual cost and timing of payments will therefore be dependent on this. The cash flow budget below assumes postponement of several payments not yet confirmed. Discussions with vendors are progressing. We will continue to monitor our cash flow positions and there may be some unexpected changes which do not allow us to live up to our assumptions.
