BACKGROUND

The precipitous decline in world oil prices over the past 18 months has severely hit the oil industry and the offshore sector. As a consequence, the capital markets access, traditionally open to the Issuer, has been adversely affected, as have the general market conditions in the markets in which the Issuer operates.

Although the Company has a strong operating cash flow, upcoming debt maturities and unfinanced capital expenditures are expected to create a liquidity shortfall. The Company and its subsidiaries' (the "Group") have been in active dialogue with its key stakeholders (including banks, bondholders, equity holders, shipyards and Teekay Corporation ("TKC")) to secure measures that will bridge the liquidity shortfall and substantially strengthen the Company's balance sheet.

The measures include contributions and support from all stakeholder groups including:

(i)

Commercial banks committing to new loan financings, refinancings of existing loans and

extensions/restructurings of existing derivative contracts;

(ii)

The Issuer raising common equity to partially offset distribution payments to unitholders;

(iii)

TKC subordinating and resetting the maturity of a $200 million loan to the Issuer beyond

31 December 2018;

(iv)

Investors agreeing to buy new preferred equity of $200 million, with distributions to be

paid in kind (in the form of common equity); and

(v)

The Issuer requesting bondholders in TOP02 and TOP04 to reset the bond maturities until

November and December 2018, respectively (with partial amortization payments).

The terms and conditions for the TOP02 and TOP04 maturity extensions and certain other amendments (the "Bond Amendments") are set out and described in the term sheet attached hereto as Schedule A (the "Bond Amendment Term Sheet"). The Bond Amendments shall be implemented at the latest by 15 July 2016 in connection with the implementation of the above steps.

Accordingly, the Company has requested the Bond Trustee to convene a Bondholders' Meeting for each Bond Issue in order to seek consents and approvals for the Proposal (as defined below).

Sheet, authorise and instruct the Bond Trustee to take such steps on behalf of the

connection with documenting the decisions made by the Bondholders' Meeting according

to this summons, and (b) for and on behalf of the Bondholders, take such further actions

and negotiate, agree, enter into, sign and execute such agreements and documents that

are required to complete and give effect to the Proposal, including the granting of

waivers, giving of instructions, consents, approvals and directions (including to the

Amendments and the terms in the Bond Amendment Term Sheet where such

Section 1: Summary

Teekay Offshore Partners requests TOP02 and TOP04 NOK bondholders reset maturities out to late-2018 with amortizations as part of a comprehensive recapitalization plan

· Teekay Offshore Partners L.P. ("T O O " or the "Company") is facing liquidity issues due to deteriorated access to the capital markets
· T O O 's strong backlog of profitable growth projects provides visible and increasing cash flow over the next few years; however, unfinanced C A P E X and upcoming debt maturities create a liquidity shortfall
· TO O , together with main sponsor, Teekay Corporation ("T K Corp" or "T K C "), has initiated a comprehensive recapitalization plan involving all stakeholders (banks, bondholders, shareholders, shipyards and T K Corp)
· The T O O recapitalization plan includes:
o Commercial Banks committing $723 million towards new loan financings, refinancings of existing loans and extensions/restructurings of existing derivative contracts
o Deferring two accommodation rig construction contracts to after the maturity of TOP02 and TO P04 resulting in a capital expenditure deferral of $397 million
o Following December 2015 dividend distribution cut of 80% to all LP equity holders, paying TK Corp's 37% share of dividend distributions as Payment-in-Kind ("PIK") with the remaining common LP distributions only to be paid as long as at a minimum an equal amount of new common equity is raised, totaling ~$120 million of equity contribution over a 2.5 year period. Distributions to Series C preferred equity holders to be PIKed until the earlier of (i) Dec 2018, or (ii) when TOP02 and TOP04 have been redeemed in full 0)
o Subordinating and resetting the maturity of the $200 million TK Corp loan beyond 2018
o Raising new preferred equity of $200 million with distributions to be paid in kind
o Requesting TOP02 and TO P04 NOK bondholders reset maturities until late-2018 (with partial amortization payments)®

· In addition, T O O has initiated a series of additional liquidity improving initiatives, including reducing O P E X , G & A and sale of assets, and T K Corp has initiated a recapitalization plan

· The recapitalization plan provides T O O with a liquidity runway until such time as the capital markets become a viable financing source once again (anticipated to be 2018 or earlier)

o Projected de-leveraging to ~3.2x by the end of 2018 positions TO O to access equity and debt markets to refinance 2018/2019 bond maturities

· Commitment by all stakeholders to the plan required by mid-May with targeted closing by 30 June 2016

· TOO is in process of raising up to $200 million of preferred equity
o Preferred equity instrument viewed as the only viable option for raising new junior capital as the MLP market is currently not open to new common equity issuance
o Terms of the preferred security are under discussion with investors and TOO has already received a strong indication of interest for the full $200 million
o Distributions on the new preferred security to be paid as PIK in the form of common LP units until the earlier of (i) Dec 2018, or (ii) when TOP02 and TOP04 have been redeemed in full. Alternatively, from June 2018 onwards the Series D preferred equity can be paid in cash if an equal amount of common equity is raised

· TOO will approach the existing Series C preferred equity investors to negotiate paying distributions as PIK in the form of common LP units until the earlier of (i) Dec 2018, or (ii) when TOP02 and TOP04 have been redeemed in full (cash savings of $53.75M over 2.5 years). Alternatively, distributions to Series C preferred equity can be paid in cash if an equal amount of common equity is raised

Equity Raising Considerations

Section 2: Recapitalization plan

Raising preferred equity is the only viable option for TOO at this time

Source of junior capital with no contractual dividends or redemption incentives High execution risk due to challenging capital markets, especially the market for energy related companies Size of equity raise ($200 million) is challenging relative to current market capitalization ($636 million)
Lower execution risk - TOO has already received strong interest Will receive equity treatment and will not negatively impact liquidity covenant Fixed coupon; however, cash impact can be managed through the structure of the security

Section 3: Business update

Offshore and deepwater will continue to play a key role going forward

· Global oil demand is expected to grow significantly in the future due to the needs of a growing global middle class
· Production from existing conventional oilfields is expected to decline by two thirds by 2040, spurring the need for new sources of production
· Deepwater will play an important role with production expected to increase by -70% from 2014 levels to 10 mb/d by 2040 (CAGR of 2.1%)

Section 3: Business update

· There are currently 55+ potential FPSO projects in the North Sea and Brazil
o A number of these projects are expected to be awarded once oil market conditions improve
· Oil price cost break-even decreasing rapidly due to deflation in field development and production costs
