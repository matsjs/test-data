To the bondholders in: ISIN NO 001036899.6 - 10.85 per cent PetroProd Ltd Secured Callable Bond Issue 2007/2013

Oslo, 25 September 2009
Proposal to enter into an agreement in relation to the termination of the CJ70 Contract (as defined below) - Summons to Bondholders' Meeting
1. BACKGROUND
Norsk Tillitsmann ASA ("NTM"/"Norsk Tillitsmann") acts as trustee for the holders (the "Bondholders") of bonds (the "10.85% Bonds") in the above mentioned loans with ISIN NO 001036899.6 (the "10.85% Bond Loan") where PetroProd Ltd is the borrower (the "Borrower").
All capitalised terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the loan agreement governing the Bonds (the "Loan Agreement") or the summons to this Bondholders' meeting unless otherwise stated.
Pursuant to a contract dated 22 June 2007, as amended by a Supplementary Agreement on 18 November 2008, between PetroProd D&P I Ltd (the "Company") and Jurong Shipyard Pte Limited ("Jurong") (the "CJ70 Contract"), Jurong agreed to construct, build, test, sell and deliver to the Company a MSC CJ70 Class Offshore Jack-Up Drilling and Production Unit (the "Unit").
By an assignment dated 20 November 2007 between the Company and NTM (the "20 November Assignment"), the Company assigned all of its rights, title and interest under the CJ70 Contract to NTM.
By a second priority assignment dated 4 March 2009 between the Company and NTM (the "Assignment of Equipment Contracts"), the Company assigned and agreed to assign all its present future rights, titles and interest in and to, and all benefits accrued and to accrue to the Company under the following contracts:
(a) a contract evidenced by purchase order no. J001/0007 dated 18 February 2008 and purchase order no. J001/0008 dated 19 April 2009 between the Company and National Oilwell Norway NS;
(b) a contract evidenced by purchase order no. J001/0002 dated 10 October 2007 and purchase order no. J001/0014 dated 30 October 2008 between the Company and Hydrill LLC; and
(c) a contract evidenced by purchase order no. J001/0003 dated 27 September 2007 between the Company and Velco Gray Pte Ltd,
collectively referred to as the "Equipment Contracts".
Outstanding payments in the sums of USD59,525,479, EUR7,230,000 and SGD29,697,000 (exclusive of interest) are due to Jurong under the CJ70 Contract, being monies due under 3rd and 4th milestone payments pursuant to the CJ70 Contract (the "Outstanding Milestone Payments").

On 1 September 2009, Jurong terminated the CJ70 Contract. As a result, Jurong is now entitled to exercise all rights available to it under the CJ70 Contract, including its rights of sale in respect of the Unit.
2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION
Based on advice from AMA Capital Partners, NTM understands that, should Jurong exercise its rights of sale in relation to the Unit under the CJ70 Contract, the incomplete state of the Unit would mean that the likely sales proceeds would not be sufficient to cover the Outstanding Milestone Payments and therefore would be unlikely to provide any recoveries to the Bondholders.
Jurong is willing to enter into an agreement with NTM and the Company pursuant to which Jurong will pay USD8,000,000 to NTM (the "Payment") in consideration for:
(a) NTM re-assigning to the Company its rights, title and interests under the Assignment of Equipment Contracts;
(b) the Company novating to Jurong each and every contract between the Company and any 3rd party vendor or supplier of equipment and/or services for the purposes of or in relation to the Unit, including but not limited to the Equipment Contracts; and
(c) NTM agreeing that any remedies, claim or rights whatsoever against Jurong with respect to or arising under or in relation to the CJ70 Contract or the Unit are deemed to be completely barred, waived and extinguished,
together the "Re-assignment, Novation and Waiver".
Jurong has agreed that upon making the Payment and by entering into the Re-assignment, Novation and Waiver, it will release the Company and the Borrower from all and any legal and/or equitable claims and actions with respect to or arising from the CJ70 Contract, the Unit, the Equipment Contracts, any 3rd party vendor or supplier contract, purchase order or otherwise in relation to the Unit.
It is therefore proposed that the Bondholders authorise NTM to enter into agreements with the Company and Jurong on the terms set out above.

It is proposed that the Bondholders, meeting in relation to the Loan Agreement referred to in the heading to this meeting summons, resolve the following resolution:
Norsk Tillitsmann is authorised and instructed to enter into agreements with the Company and Jurong on the terms set out above.
According to the Loan Agreement, the above mentioned proposal requires a qualified majority of 2/3 of the 10.85% Bond Loan represented at the Bondholders' meeting voting in favour of such proposals and a minimum 5/10 of the outstanding 10.85% Bonds being represented at the meeting for the 10.85% Bond Loan. Bondholders may be represented in person or by proxy.
-oOo-
Please find attached a Bondholder's Form from the Securities Depository (VPS), indicating your bondholding at the present date. The Bondholder's Form will serve as proof of ownership of the 10.85% Bonds and of the voting rights at the Bondholders' meeting. (If the 10.85% Bonds are held in custody - i.e. the owner is not registered directly in the VPS - the custodian must confirm; (i) the owner of the 10.85% Bonds, (ii) the aggregate nominal amount of the 10.85% Bonds and (iii) the account number in VPS on which the 10.85% Bonds are registered).
The individual Bondholder may authorise NTM to vote on its behalf, in which case the Bondholder's Form also serves as a proxy. A duly signed Bondholder's Form, authorising NTM to vote, must then be returned to NTM in due time before the meeting is scheduled (by scanned e-mail, telefax or post please see the first page of this letter for further details).
In the event that the 10.85% Bonds have been transferred to a new owner after the Bondholder's Form was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the Bondholders' meeting or enclose with the proxy, as the case may be, evidence which the NTM accepts as sufficient proof of the ownership of the 10.85% Bonds.
For practical purposes, we request those who intend to attend the Bondholders' meeting, either in person or by proxy other than to NTM, to notify NTM by telephone or by e-mail (as set out at the first page of this letter) by 17.00 hours Oslo time (16.00 hours London time) the Banking Day before the meeting takes place.
Yours sincerely
