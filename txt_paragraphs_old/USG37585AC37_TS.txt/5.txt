This document is in two parts. The first part is this prospectus supplement, which describes the specific terms of this offering and certain other matters. The second part, the prospectus, gives more general information about securities we may offer from time to time. Generally, when we refer to the "prospectus", we are referring to both parts of this document combined. You should read both this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, together with additional information described under the heading "Where You Can Find Additional Information" and "Incorporation by Reference". To the extent the description of our securities in this prospectus supplement differs from the description of our securities in the accompanying prospectus, you should rely on the information in this prospectus supplement.
You should rely only on the information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. We have not, and the underwriters have not, authorized anyone to provide you with different information. The distribution of this prospectus and sale of these securities in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law. Persons in possession of this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus are required to inform themselves about and observe any such restrictions. We are not making an offer to sell these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted. You should assume that the information appearing in this prospectus supplement is accurate as of the date on the front cover of this prospectus supplement only. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed since that date.
