Purchase and Cancellation
We may, to the extent permitted by law, and directly or indirectly (regardless of whether such Notes are surrendered to us), purchase Notes in the open market or by tender offer at any price or by private agreement.
Reports
So long as any Notes are outstanding, we will (i) file with the SEC within the time periods prescribed by its rules and regulations and applicable to us and (ii) furnish to the Trustee and the holders of the Notes within 15 days after the date on which we would be required to file the same with the SEC pursuant to its rules and regulations (giving effect to any grace period provided by Rule 12b-25 under the Exchange Act):
(1) all financial information to the extent required of us to be contained in Forms 20-F and, with respect to the annual consolidated financial statements only, a report thereon by our independent auditors.
We shall not be required to file any report or other information with the SEC if the SEC does not permit such filing, although such reports will be required to be furnished to the Trustee. Documents filed by us with the SEC via the EDGAR system will be deemed to have been furnished to the Trustee and the holders of the Notes as of the time such documents are filed via EDGAR; provided, however, that the Trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever to determine whether or not such filing has occurred.
Replacement of Notes
We will replace mutilated, destroyed, stolen or lost Notes at the expense of the holder upon delivery to the Trustee of the mutilated Notes, or evidence of the loss, theft or destruction of the Notes satisfactory to us and the Trustee. In the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed note, indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee and us may be required at the expense of the holder of such note before a replacement note will be issued.
