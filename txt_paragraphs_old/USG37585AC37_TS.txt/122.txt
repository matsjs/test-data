Certain Definitions and Interpretations
For purposes of the foregoing provisions, the following definitions shall apply:
"Cash and Cash Equivalents "means cash on hand, deposits with banks which are repayable on demand, short term, highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash with original maturities of six months or less that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, but exclude any cash that is specifically blocked and/or charged. For the avoidance of doubt, Cash and Cash Equivalents shall not be subject to any Encumbrances.
