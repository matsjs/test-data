additional information, please read " Description of Notes--Optional Redemption." The indenture governing the Notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including covenants that require us to maintain a certain amount of asset coverage and provide certain reports. For additional information, please read "Description of Notes." We may "reopen" the Notes at any time without the consent of the holders of the Notes and issue additional notes with the same terms as the Notes (except the issue price, issue date and initial interest payment date), which will thereafter constitute a single fungible series with the Notes. We intend to use the net proceeds of the sale of the Notes, which, after deducting underwriting discounts and the estimated expenses payable by us, are expected to total approximately $245,280,750, for the repayment of debt and general corporate purposes, including working capital. The Notes will not be rated by any Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange.
