Payment and Paying Agents
Payments in respect of the principal and interest on global notes registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, in its capacity as the registered holder under the Indenture. In the case of certificated Notes, payments will be made in U.S. dollars at the office of the Trustee or, at our option, by wire transfer or check mailed to the holder's registered address. The Issuer will make any required interest payments to the person in whose name each note is registered at the close of business on the record date for the interest payment.
The Trustee will be designated as the Issuer's paying agent for payments on the Notes. We may at any time designate additional paying agents or rescind the designation of any paying agent or approve a change in the office through which any paying agent acts.
Subject to the requirements of any applicable abandoned property laws, the Trustee and paying agent shall pay to us upon written request any money held by them for payments on the Notes that remain unclaimed for two years after the date upon which that payment has become due. After payment to us, holders entitled to the money must look to the Issuer for payment. In that case, all liability of the Trustee or paying agent with respect to that money will cease.
Purchase and Cancellation
The registrar and paying agent (if other than the Trustee) will forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them by holders for transfer, exchange or payment. All Notes delivered to the Trustee shall be cancelled promptly by the Trustee in the manner provided in the Indenture and may not be reissued or resold. No Notes shall be authenticated in exchange for any Notes cancelled, except as provided in the Indenture.
