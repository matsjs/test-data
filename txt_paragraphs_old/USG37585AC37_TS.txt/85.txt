Tax Risks
In addition to the following risk factors, you should read "Material Tax Considerations" for a more complete discussion of the material Bermuda and U.S. Federal income tax considerations relating to us and the Notes.
We will have to pay tax on U.S.-source income, which would reduce our earnings.
Under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("the Code"), the U.S. source gross transportation income of a ship-owning or chartering corporation, such as ourselves, is subject to a 4% U.S. Federal income tax without allowance for deduction, unless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax under a tax treaty or Section 883 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. U.S.-source gross transportation income consists of 50% of the gross shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States.
We do not currently qualify for a tax treaty exemption or a statutory tax exemption, and therefore we are subject to the 4% U.S. Federal income tax on our U.S.-source gross transportation income. We do not expect any resulting U.S. tax liability to be material or materially reduce the earnings available for distribution to our shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. For 2016, the U.S. source gross transportation tax was $0.30 million. Changes to our business could change this expectation and in such circumstances we may attempt to qualify for the exemption from tax under Section 883. For a more detailed discussion, see "Material Tax Considerations--U.S. Taxation of Shipping Income."
