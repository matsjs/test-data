Generally, the holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes may waive any Default or Event of Default unless:
· the Issuer fails to pay the principal of or any interest on any Note when due;
· the Issuer fails to comply with any of the provisions of the Indenture that would require the consent of the holder of each outstanding Note affected.
The Indenture provides that within 90 days after the Trustee receives written notice of a Default, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all holders, notice of such Default hereunder, unless such Default shall have been cured or waived. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the best interest of the holders.
