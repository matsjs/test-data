Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we so elect, the sole remedy under the Indenture for an Event of Default relating to (i) our failure to file with the Trustee pursuant to Section 314(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act any documents or reports that we are required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or (ii) the failure to comply with our reporting obligations to the Trustee and the SEC, as described under "--Reports" below will, after the occurrence of such an Event of Default, consist exclusively of the right to receive additional interest on the Notes at an annual rate equal to (a) 0.25% per annum of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes for each day during the 90-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which such Event of Default first occurs and on which such Event of Default is continuing; and (b) 0.50% per annum of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes for each day during the 90-day period beginning on, and including, the 91st day following, and including the date on which such Event of Default first occurs and on which such Event of Default is continuing. In the event we do not elect to pay the additional interest upon an Event of Default in accordance with this paragraph, the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided above. This additional interest will be payable in arrears on the same dates and in the same manner as regular interest on the Notes. On the 181st day after such Event of Default first occurs (if not waived or cured prior to such 181st day), such additional interest will cease to accrue and the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided above. The provisions of the Indenture described in this paragraph will not affect the rights of holders of Notes in the event of the occurrence of any other Events of Default.
In order to elect to pay additional interest as the sole remedy during the first 180 days after the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to the failure to comply with the reporting obligations in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph, we must notify all holders of record of Notes and the Trustee and paying agent of such election on or before the close of business on the fifth business day prior to the date on which such Event of Default would otherwise occur. Upon our failure to timely give such notice or pay additional interest, the Notes will be immediately subject to acceleration as provided above.
The Trustee will not be obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers at the request of the holders unless the holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Subject to the Indenture, applicable law and upon providing indemnification satisfactory to the Trustee, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Notes. The Indenture will provide that in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of such person's own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder.
No holder will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to or under the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or a Trustee, or for any other remedy under the Indenture unless:
· the holder has previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;
· the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding have made a written request and have offered indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request to institute such proceeding as Trustee; and
· the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days after such notice, request and offer and has not received from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request within 60 days after such notice, request and offer.
However, the above limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by a holder for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or interest on any Note on or after the applicable due date in accordance with the Indenture.
