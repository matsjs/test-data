U.S. Taxation o f Our Operating Income
U.S. Taxation o f Shipping Income
Subject to the discussion of "effectively connected" income below, unless we are exempt from U.S. Federal income tax under the rules contained in Section 883 of the Code, we will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax under the rules of Section 887 of the Code, which would impose on us a 4% U.S. income tax in respect of our U.S. source gross transportation income (without the allowance for deductions).
For this purpose, U.S. source gross transportation income includes 50% of the shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends (but that does not both begin and end) in the United States. Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between non-U.S. ports is generally not subject to any U.S. income tax.
For this purpose, "shipping income" means income that is derived from:
(i) the use of ships;
(ii) the hiring or leasing of ships for use on a time, operating or bareboat charter basis;
(iii) the participation in a pool, partnership, strategic alliance, joint operating agreement or other joint venture we directly or indirectly own or participate in that generates such income; or
(iv) the performance of services directly related to those uses.
