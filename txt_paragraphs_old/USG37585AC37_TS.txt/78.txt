RISK FACTORS
Any investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the important factors set forth under the heading "Risk Factors" starting on page 6 of our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017 and incorporated herein by reference, before investing in the Notes. For further details, see the sections entitled "Where You Can Find Additional Information" and "Incorporation by Reference".
Any of the risk factors referred to above could significantly and negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. The risks referred to above are not the only ones that may exist. Additional risks not currently known by us or that we deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. You may lose all or a part of your investment. In addition, potential investors should consider the following risks and uncertainties with respect to your investment in the Notes.
Your investment in the Notes is subject to our credit risk.
The Notes are unsubordinated unsecured general obligations of ours and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. The Notes will rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including the return of the principal amount at maturity or any redemption date, as applicable, depends on our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due. As a result, our actual and perceived creditworthiness may affect the market value of the Notes and, in the event we were to default on our obligations, you may not receive the amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.
The amount o f our debt could limit our liquidity andflexibility in obtaining additionalfinancing and in pursuing other business opportunities.
