· upon delivery of the last of our five contracted newbuildings in 2019, our owned fleet will have an average age of 6.3 years, making it one of the youngest in the industry, compared to a current average age of 11.9 years for the global LNG carrier fleet including LNG carriers of all sizes as of December 31, 2016.
We continually evaluate short and long-term charter opportunities for our vessels. Our discussions with potential charterers are at various stages of advancement; however, as of the date of this prospectus supplement, we cannot provide assurance that we will conclude any particular charter or, if concluded, the charter rate that will apply.
Managed Fleet
Through GasLog LNG Services, we provide technical ship management services for three LNG carriers owned by third parties (including the bareboat vessel), in addition to management of the 21 LNG carriers currently operating in our owned fleet (the Solaris is managed by a subsidiary of Shell). We supervised the construction by Samsung of each LNG carrier in our managed fleet, and each ship has operated under our technical management since its delivery from the shipyard with the exception of the Solaris.
