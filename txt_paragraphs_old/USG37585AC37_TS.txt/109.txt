The Notes will be issued under an indenture to be dated as of March 22, 2017 (or the Base Indenture), between the Issuer and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as trustee (or the Trustee), as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture to be dated as of March 22, 2017, between the Issuer and the Trustee (or the Supplemental Indenture and, together with the Base Indenture, the Indenture).
Other than as described under "--Certain Covenants," the Indenture and the terms of the Notes will not contain any covenants restricting the operation of our business, our ability to pay dividends, our ability to incur debt or grant liens on our assets or that are designed to afford holders of the Notes protection in a highly leveraged or other transaction involving us that may adversely affect holders of the Notes.
The Notes will mature on March 22, 2022 and will bear interest at a rate of 8.875% per annum. Interest on the Notes will accrue from March 22, 2017. The Issuer will make interest payments on the Notes quarterly in arrears on March 30, June 30, September 30, and December 30 of each year, beginning on June 30, 2017, to holders of record at the close of business on March 15, June 15, September 15, or December 15 (whether or not that date is a business day), as the case may be, immediately preceding such interest payment date, and on the maturity date. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months.
If any interest payment date would otherwise be a day that is not a business day, that interest payment date will be postponed to the next date that is a business day. If the maturity date of the Notes falls on a day that is not a business day, the related payment of principal and interest will be made on the next business day as if it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amounts so payable for the period from and after such date to the next business day.
The Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.
