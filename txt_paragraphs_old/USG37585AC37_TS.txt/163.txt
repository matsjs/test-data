Our U.S. source gross transportation income would be considered effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business only if:
(ii) substantially all of our U.S. source gross transportation income was attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a ship that followed a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the United States.
We believe that we will not meet these conditions because we will not have, or permit circumstances that would result in having, such a fixed place of business in the United States or any ship sailing to or from the United States on a regularly scheduled basis.
In addition, income attributable to transportation that both begins and ends in the United States is not subject to the tax rules described above. Such income is subject to either a 30% gross-basis tax or to U.S. corporate income tax on net income at rates of up to 35% (and the branch profits tax discussed above). Although there can be no assurance, we do not expect to engage in transportation that produces shipping income of this type.
Taxation o f Gain on Sale o f Shipping Assets
Regardless of whether we qualify for the exemption under Section 883 of the Code, we will not be subject to U.S. income taxation with respect to gain realized on a sale of a ship, provided the sale is considered to occur outside of the United States (as determined under U.S. tax principles). In general, a sale of a ship will be considered to occur outside of the United States for this purpose if title to the ship (and risk of loss with respect to the ship) passes to the buyer outside of the United States. We expect that any sale of a ship will be so structured that it will be considered to occur outside of the United States.
