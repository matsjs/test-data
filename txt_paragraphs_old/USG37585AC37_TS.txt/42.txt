Our chairman, Peter G. Livanos, is our largest shareholder through his ownership of Ceres Shipping, which has a majority ownership interest in Blenheim Holdings Ltd., or "Blenheim Holdings". The shipping activities of the Livanos family commenced more than 100 years ago, and Ceres Shipping also has interests in tankers, dry bulk carriers and containerships. Ceres Shipping's LNG shipping activities commenced in 2001, and its operations in the LNG shipping sector are conducted exclusively through GasLog. Entities controlled by members of the Livanos family, including our chairman, are deemed to beneficially own approximately 40.16% of our issued and outstanding common shares. As a result of his ownership of our common shares, Mr. Livanos can effectively control the outcome of most matters on which GasLog's shareholders are entitled to vote.
Anthony Papadimitriou, a member of our Board, was originally designated by the Onassis Foundation to serve as one of our directors. The Onassis Foundation beneficially owns 8.68% of our issued and outstanding common shares.
