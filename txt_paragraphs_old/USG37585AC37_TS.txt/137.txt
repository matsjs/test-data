(5) failure to perform any of the other covenants in the Indenture, continued for 60 days after written notice has been given by the Trustee, or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, as provided in the Indenture;
(7) any final non-appealable judgment or decree for the payment of money in excess of $50,000,000 is entered against any Group Company and remains outstanding for a period of 90 consecutive days following entry of such final non-appealable judgment or decree and is not discharged, waived or stayed; and
(8) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization affecting the Issuer or any Material Group Company.
If an Event of Default, other than an Event of Default described in clause (7) above, occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal amount of the Notes to be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default described in clause (8) above occurs, the principal amount of the Notes and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will automatically become immediately due and payable.
After any such acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such acceleration if all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of accelerated principal and any premium, interest or Additional Amounts which have become due as a result of such acceleration, have been cured or waived.
