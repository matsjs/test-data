(1) For purposes of calculating the ratios above:
· "earnings" is the result of adding (a) pre-tax income from continuing operations before adjustment for non controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries or income of equity investees (which includes non-cash unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments), (b) fixed charges, (c) amortization of capitalized interest, and (d) distributed income of equity investees, and subtracting interest capitalized;
· "fixed charges" represent (i) interest incurred (whether expensed or capitalized) (ii) amortized premiums and capitalized expenses related to indebtedness, (iii) interest within rental expense, and (iv) preference security dividend requirements of consolidated subsidiaries;
· "preference dividends" refers to the amount of pre-tax earnings that is required to pay the cash dividends on outstanding Series A Preference Shares. There is no effective income tax rate applicable to continuing operations. We did not have any preference shares outstanding during the periods from 2011 to 2014 and the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preference dividends is equivalent to the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for these periods. As of March 14, 2016, we had 4,600,000 outstanding Series A Preference Shares.
