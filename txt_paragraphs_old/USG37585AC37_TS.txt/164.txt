Taxation of United States Holders
You are a "U.S. holder" if you are a beneficial owner of the Notes and you are a U.S. citizen or resident, a U.S. corporation (or other U.S. entity taxable as a corporation), an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. Federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.
If a partnership holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding the Notes, you should consult your own tax advisor.
Interest on the Notes
Interest on a note generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary income at the time such interest is received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder's method of tax accounting for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.
Interest paid on the Notes generally will be foreign source income and, depending on your circumstances, treated as either "passive" or "general" category income for purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits for U.S. Federal income tax purposes
