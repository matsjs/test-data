SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF LIABILITIES
We are a Bermuda exempted company. Our registered address in Bermuda is Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton, HM 11, Bermuda. A majority of our directors and some of the named experts referred to in this prospectus supplement are not residents of the United States, and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process on those persons in the United States or to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in U.S. courts against us or those persons based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. It is doubtful whether courts in Bermuda will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions, including the United States, against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in Bermuda against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of other jurisdictions.
