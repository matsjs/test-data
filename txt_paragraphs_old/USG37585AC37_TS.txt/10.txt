December 5, 2016 we announced that Keppel Shipyard Limited had begun ordering the long lead items required for the conversion of a GasLog or Gaslog Partners LNG carrier to a FSRU. In addition, on December 22, 2016 we announced that a wholly owned subsidiary of GasLog has entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire a 20% shareholding in Gastrade. Gastrade is licensed to develop an independent natural gas system offshore Alexandroupolis in Northern Greece utilizing a FSRU along with other fixed infrastructure. The acquisition of the 20% shareholding in Gastrade closed on February 9, 2017.
On May 12, 2014, our subsidiary GasLog Partners completed an initial public offering in which it raised net proceeds of $186.03 million. GasLog Partners was formed by us to own and operate LNG carriers under long-term charters. Its common units representing limited partner interests are traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "GLOP". Concurrently with the initial public offering, GasLog Partners acquired the entities that own the GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog Santiago and the GasLog Sydney from us. On September 29, 2014, GasLog Partners completed a follow-on public offering, resulting in net proceeds of $133.0 million. GasLog Partners used the proceeds to partially finance the acquisition from the Company of the entities that own the Methane Rita Andrea and the Methane Jane Elizabeth. On June 26, 2015, GasLog Partners completed a follow-on public offering, resulting in net proceeds of $171.83 million. GasLog Partners used the proceeds to partially finance the acquisition from the Company of the entities that own the Methane Alison Victoria, the Methane Shirley Elisabeth and the Methane Heather Sally. On August 5, 2016, GasLog Partners completed a follow-on public offering, resulting in net proceeds of $52.30 million. GasLog Partners used the proceeds to partially finance the acquisition from the Company of the entity that owns GasLog Seattle. On January 27, 2017, GasLog Partners completed a follow-on public offering, resulting in net proceeds of $75.49 million. In addition, the over-allotment option was partially exercised by the underwriter on February 24, 2017, resulting in net additional proceeds of $2.44 million. GasLog Partners plans to use the net proceeds from the public offering for general partnership purposes, which may include future acquisitions, debt repayment, capital expenditures and additions to working capital. GasLog Partners holds options to acquire from us seven additional vessels and GAS-twenty six Ltd. with its long-term bareboat charter of (and right to acquire) the Methane Julia Louise (which is subject to a multi-year charter to MSL) and will have certain rights to acquire future vessels meeting certain criteria that have charters with a remaining term of at least 5 years.
As of March 13, 2017, the Company holds a 27.57% interest in GasLog Partners and, as a result of its ownership of the general partner and the fact that the general partner elects the majority of the Partnership's directors in accordance with the Partnership's partnership agreement the Company has the ability to control the Partnership's affairs and policies. Consequently, GasLog Partners is consolidated in the Company's financial statements.
Expected Drop-Down Transaction
Following its equity offering in January 2017, we expect GasLog Partners to exercise their option to acquire one GasLog vessel soon after completion of this offering. The general terms and conditions of any such acquisition would be expected to be generally consistent with previous vessel acquisitions by GasLog Partners from GasLog and subject to satisfaction of certain closing conditions.
