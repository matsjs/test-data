Payments
Debt securities may bear interest at a fixed rate, which may be zero, a floating rate, or a rate which varies during the lifetime of the debt security. Debt securities bearing no interest or interest at a rate that at the time of issuance is below the prevailing market rate may be sold at a discount below their stated principal amount.
