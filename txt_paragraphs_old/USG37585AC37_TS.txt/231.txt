DESCRIPTION OF THE UNITS
We may issue units consisting of any combination of common shares, preference shares, debt securities, warrants and rights. Each unit will be issued so that the holder of the unit is also the holder of each security included in the unit. Thus, the holder of a unit will have the rights and obligations of a holder of each included security. The unit agreement under which a unit is issued may provide that the securities included in the unit may not be held or transferred separately, at any time, or at any time before a specified date.
The applicable prospectus supplement relating to any series of units will describe the terms of the units, including, where applicable, the following:
· the designation and terms of the units and of the securities comprising the units, including whether and under what circumstances those securities may be held or transferred separately;
· any provisions of the governing unit agreement; and · any provisions for the issuance, payment, settlement, transfer, or exchange of the units or of the securities
comprising the units.
