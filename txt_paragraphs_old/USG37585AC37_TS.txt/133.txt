agent holds money or securities sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price of the Notes on the Change of Control Purchase Date, then:
· the Notes will cease to be outstanding and interest, including any additional interest, if any, will cease to accrue (whether or not book-entry transfer of the Notes is made or whether or not the Notes are delivered to the paying agent); and
· all other rights of the holder will terminate (other than the right to receive the Change of Control Purchase Price).
In connection with any purchase offer pursuant to a Change of Control purchase notice, the Issuer will, if required, comply with the provisions of the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act that may then be applicable to them.
No Notes may be purchased at the option of holders thereof upon a Change of Control if the principal amount of the Notes has been accelerated, and such acceleration has not been rescinded, on or prior to the Change of Control Purchase Date.
The Change of Control purchase rights of the holders could discourage a potential acquirer of us. The Change of Control purchase feature, however, is not the result of management's knowledge of any specific effort to obtain control of us by any means or part of a plan by management to adopt a series of anti-takeover provisions.
The term Change of Control is limited to specified transactions and may not include other events that might adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, the requirement that the Issuer offers to purchase the Notes upon a Change of Control may not protect holders in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, merger or similar transaction involving us.
