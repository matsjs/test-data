In connection with an underwritten offering, we would execute an underwriting agreement with an underwriter or underwriters. Unless otherwise indicated in the revised prospectus or applicable prospectus supplement, such underwriting agreement would provide that the obligations of the underwriter or underwriters are subject to certain conditions precedent and that the underwriter or underwriters with respect to a sale of the covered securities will be obligated to purchase all of the covered securities if any such securities are purchased. We may grant to the underwriter or underwriters an option to purchase additional securities at the public offering price, as may be set forth in the revised prospectus or applicable prospectus supplement. If we grant any such option, the terms of the option will be set forth in the revised prospectus or applicable prospectus supplement.
Pursuant to a requirement by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or "FINRA", if more than five percent of the net proceeds of any offering of securities made under this prospectus will be received by any FINRA member participating in the offering or by affiliates or associated persons of such FINRA member or any participating member who otherwise would have a "conflict of interest" under FINRA Rules, the offering will be conducted in accordance with FINRA Rule 5121.
Underwriters, agents, brokers or dealers may be entitled, pursuant to relevant agreements entered into with us, to indemnification by us against certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that may arise from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact, or any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in this prospectus, any supplement or amendment hereto, or in the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, or to contribution with respect to payments which the underwriters, agents, brokers or dealers may be required to make.
We will bear all costs relating to all of the securities being registered under the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.
