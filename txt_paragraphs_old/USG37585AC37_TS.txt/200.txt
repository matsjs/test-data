INCORPORATION OF CERTAIN INFORMATION BY REFERENCE
The SEC allows us to "incorporate by reference" information that we file with it. This means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you to those filed documents. The information incorporated by reference is considered to be a part of this prospectus, and information that we file later with the SEC prior to the termination of this offering will also be considered to be part of this prospectus and will automatically update and supersede previously filed information, including information contained in this document.
This prospectus incorporates by reference the following documents:
· our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 14, 2016;
· the description of our common shares which is contained in our registration statement on Form 8-A (File No. 001-35466), filed with the SEC on March 21, 2012, including any amendment or report filed for the purpose of updating such description; and
· the description of our Series A Preference Shares which is contained in our registration statement on Form 8-A (File No. 001-35466), filed with the SEC on March 31, 2015, including any amendment or report filed for the purpose of updating such description.
We are also incorporating by reference all subsequent annual reports on Form 20-F that we file with the SEC and certain reports on Form 6-K that we furnish to the SEC after the date of this prospectus (if they state that they are incorporated by reference into this prospectus) until we file a post- effective amendment indicating that the offering of the securities made by this prospectus has been terminated. In all cases, you should rely on the later information over different information included in this prospectus or any accompanying prospectus supplement.
