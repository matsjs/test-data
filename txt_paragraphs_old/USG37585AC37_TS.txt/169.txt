U.S. individuals that hold certain specified foreign financial assets (which include notes in a foreign corporation) are subject to U.S. return disclosure obligations (and related penalties for failure to disclose). Such U.S. individuals are required to file IRS Form 8938 with their U.S. Federal income tax return, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for foreign assets held in accounts maintained by U.S. financial institutions). Notes of a foreign corporation, including the Notes, are a specified foreign asset for this purpose. Penalties apply for failure to properly complete and file Form 8938. You are encouraged to consult with your own tax advisors regarding the filing of IRS Form 8938.
