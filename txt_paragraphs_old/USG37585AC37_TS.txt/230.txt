We may issue rights to purchase our equity securities. These rights may be issued independently or together with any other security offered by this prospectus and may or may not be transferable by the shareholder receiving the rights in the rights offering. In connection with any rights offering, we may enter into a standby underwriting agreement with one or more underwriters pursuant to which the underwriter will purchase any securities that remain unsubscribed for upon completion of the rights offering.
The applicable prospectus supplement relating to any rights will describe the terms of the offered rights, including, where applicable, the following:
 the exercise price for the rights;  the number of rights issued to each shareholder;  the extent to which the rights are transferable;  any other terms of the rights, including terms, procedures and limitations relating to the exchange and
exercise of the rights;  the date on which the right to exercise the rights will commence and the date on which the right will
expire;  the amount of rights outstanding;  the extent to which the rights include an over-subscription privilege with respect to unsubscribed
securities; and  the material terms of any standby underwriting arrangement entered into by us in connection with the
rights offering.
The description in the applicable prospectus supplement of any rights we offer will not necessarily be complete and will be qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable rights certificate or rights agreement, which will be filed with the SEC if we offer rights.
