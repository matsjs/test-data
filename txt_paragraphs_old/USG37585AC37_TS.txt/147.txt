(7) we deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance and discharge of the Notes have been complied with as required by the Indenture.
Transfer and Exchange
We will maintain an office in New York City where the Notes may be presented for registration of transfer or exchange. This office will initially be an office or agency of the Trustee. No service charge will be imposed by us, the Trustee or the registrar for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, but any tax or similar governmental charge required by law or permitted by the Indenture because a holder requests any Notes to be issued in a name other than such holder's name will be paid by such holder (each such tax or similar governmental charge, a Transfer Tax). We are not required to transfer or exchange any Note surrendered for purchase except for any portion of that Note not being purchased.
We reserve the right to:
· vary or terminate the appointment of the security registrar or paying agent;
· appoint additional paying agents; or
· approve any change in the office through which any security registrar or any paying agent acts.
