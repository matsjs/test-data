Defeasance o f a Series o f Securities at Any Time. We may also discharge all of our obligations, other than as to transfers and exchanges, under any series of debt securities at any time, which we refer to as defeasance in this prospectus. We may be released with respect to any outstanding series of debt securities from the obligations imposed by any covenants and elect not to comply with those covenants without creating an event of default. Discharge under those procedures is called covenant defeasance.
Defeasance or covenant defeasance may be effected only if, among other things:
 we irrevocably deposit with the trustee cash or, in the case of debt securities payable only in U. S. dollars, U.S. government obligations, as trust funds in an amount certified to be sufficient to pay on each date that they become due and payable, the principal of and interest on, and any mandatory sinking fund payments for, all outstanding debt securities of the series being defeased; and
 we deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that:
 the holders of the series of debt securities being defeased will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the defeasance or covenant defeasance;
 the defeasance or covenant defeasance will not otherwise alter those holders' United States federal income tax treatment of principal and interest payments on the series of debt securities being defeased; and
 in the case of a defeasance, this opinion must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or a change in United States federal income tax law occurring after the date of this prospectus, since that result would not occur under current tax law.
