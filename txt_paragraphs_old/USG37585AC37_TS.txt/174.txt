In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market. Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases.
· Short sales involve secondary market sales by the underwriters of a greater principal amount of Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering.
· Covering transactions involve purchases of Notes by the underwriters in the open market in order to cover short positions.
· To close a short position, the underwriters must purchase Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.
