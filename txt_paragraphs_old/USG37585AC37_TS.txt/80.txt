Our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own all o f our operating assets, andyour right to receive payments on the Notes is structurally subordinated to the rights o f the lenders o f our subsidiaries, including GasLog Partners.
We are a holding company. Our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own our operating assets, including our ships. As a result, our ability to make required payments on the Notes depends entirely on the operations of our subsidiaries and our subsidiaries' ability to distribute funds to us. To the extent our subsidiaries are unable to distribute, or are restricted from distributing, funds to us, we may be unable to fulfill our obligations under the Notes. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due on the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. The Notes will not be guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries or any other person.
The rights of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the rights of our subsidiaries' lenders. A default by a subsidiary under its debt obligations would result in a block on distributions from the affected subsidiary to us. The Notes will be effectively junior to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of our subsidiaries, creditors of our subsidiaries will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to us. As of December 31, 2016, our subsidiaries had $2.74 billion of outstanding debt (all of which was secured). In addition, the indenture under which the Notes will be issued will permit our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, subject to the limitations set forth therein. Please read "Description of Notes--Certain covenants--Limitations on Total Indebtedness."
We may be unable to comply with covenants in our existing orfuturefinancing arrangements that impose operating andfinancial restrictions on us.
Our credit facilities impose, and any future credit facility we enter into will impose, operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These restrictions in our credit facilities generally limit our shipowning subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:
· incur additional indebtedness, create liens or provide guarantees;
· provide any form of credit or financial assistance to, or enter into any non-arms' length transactions with, us or any of our affiliates;
· sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including our ships;
