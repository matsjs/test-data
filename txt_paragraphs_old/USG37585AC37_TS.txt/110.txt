The Notes will be issued only in fully registered form without coupons and in minimum denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will be represented by one or more global securities registered in the name of a nominee of DTC. Except as described under "--Book-entry System; Delivery and Form," the Notes will not be issuable in certificated form.
The Notes are not listed, and we do not currently intend to list the Notes, on any securities exchange or to seek approval for their quotation through any automated quotation system. We cannot assure you that an active public market for the Notes will develop. The absence of an active public trading market could have an adverse effect on the liquidity and value of the Notes.
Trading Characteristics
The Notes are expected to trade at a price that takes into account the value, if any, of accrued but unpaid interest; thus, purchasers will not pay and sellers will not receive accrued and unpaid interest with respect to the Notes that is not included in the trading price thereof. Any portion of the trading price of a Note received that is attributable to accrued interest will be treated as ordinary interest income for federal income tax purposes and will not be treated as part of the amount realized for purposes of determining gain or loss on the disposition of the Note.
