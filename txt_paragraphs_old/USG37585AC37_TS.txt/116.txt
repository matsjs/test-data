Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer would be obligated to pay Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due. Before the Issuer publishes, mails or delivers notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee and paying agent (a) an Officer's Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer to so redeem have occurred and (b) an opinion of independent legal counsel of recognized standing satisfactory to the Trustee and paying agent that the Issuer has or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of the circumstances referred to in clause (1) or (2) of the preceding paragraph.
The Trustee and paying agent will accept and will be entitled to conclusively rely upon the Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, in which case they will be conclusive and binding on the holders.

(a) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed and
(b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to but excluding the date of redemption), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points
