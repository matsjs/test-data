The Indenture and the Notes will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of laws.
The Trustee, in its individual and any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Issuer as if it were not the Trustee; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue or resign.
The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing (which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of such person's own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of the Notes, unless such holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, will be the Trustee under the Indenture. Initially, the Trustee will also act as the paying agent, registrar and custodian for the Notes.
