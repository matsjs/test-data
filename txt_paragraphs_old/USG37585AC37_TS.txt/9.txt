Our wholly owned subsidiary, GasLog LNG Services, handles the technical management of our fleet (one of our vessels is managed by a subsidiary of Shell), including plan approval for new ship orders, supervision of ship construction and planning and supervision of dry-dockings, as well as technical operations, crewing, training, maintenance, regulatory and classification compliance and health, safety, security and environmental, or "HSSE", management and reporting. As the sole technical manager of BG Group's owned fleet of LNG carriers for over 15 years, we have established a track record for the efficient, safe and reliable operation of LNG carriers, which is evidenced by our safety performance and the limited off-hire days of the 24 ships currently operating under our management.

December 5, 2016 we announced that Keppel Shipyard Limited had begun ordering the long lead items required for the conversion of a GasLog or Gaslog Partners LNG carrier to a FSRU. In addition, on December 22, 2016 we announced that a wholly owned subsidiary of GasLog has entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire a 20% shareholding in Gastrade. Gastrade is licensed to develop an independent natural gas system offshore Alexandroupolis in Northern Greece utilizing a FSRU along with other fixed infrastructure. The acquisition of the 20% shareholding in Gastrade closed on February 9, 2017.
