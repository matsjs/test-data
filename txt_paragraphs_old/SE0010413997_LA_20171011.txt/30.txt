By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder agrees that the Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Notes, each subsequent Noteholder confirms such agreement.
Provided that at the time of issuance, the Issuer meets the Incurrence Test (tested pro forma including such incurrence), the Issuer may, on one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Notes. Subsequent Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate, the currency, the nominal amount and the final maturity applicable to the Initial Notes shall apply to Subsequent Notes. The issue price of the Subsequent Notes may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal Amount. The maximum aggregate nominal amount of the Notes (the Initial Notes and all Subsequent Notes) may not exceed EUR 400,000,000 unless a consent from the Noteholders is obtained in accordance with Clause 18.7(a). Each Subsequent Note shall entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with Clause 10.1, and otherwise have the same rights as the Initial Notes.
The Notes constitute direct, general, senior, unsubordinated and secured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu and without any preference among them and, subject to the super senior status of (i) the RCF, (ii) the PIL and (iii) the Permitted Hedging Obligations as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement, at least pari passu with all other direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and secured obligations of the Issuer, except obligations which are preferred by mandatory law and except as otherwise provided in the Finance Documents.
