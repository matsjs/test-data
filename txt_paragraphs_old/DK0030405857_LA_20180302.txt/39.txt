(b) The Issuer shall, if any tax is withheld in respect of the Bonds under the Finance Documents:
(i) gross up the amount of the payment due up to such amount which is necessary to ensure that the Bondholders or the Bond Trustee, as the case may be, receive a net amount which (after making the required withholding) is equal to the payment which would have been received if no withholding had been required; and
(ii) at the request of the Bond Trustee, deliver to the Bond Trustee evidence that the required tax deduction or withholding has been made.
(b) Any fees levied on the trade of Bonds in the secondary market shall be paid by the Bondholders, unless otherwise provided by law or regulation, and the Issuer shall not be responsible for reimbursing any such fees.
8.5 Currency
All amounts payable under the Finance Documents shall be payable in the denomination of the Bonds set out in Clause 2.1 (Amount, denomination and ISIN of the Bonds). If, however, the denomination differs from the currency of the bank account connected to the Bondholder's account in the CSD, any cash settlement may be exchanged at the cost of the relevant Bondholder and credited to this bank account.
8.6 Set-off and counterclaims
The Issuer may not apply or perform any counterclaim or set-off against any payment obligations pursuant to these Bond Terms or any other Finance Document.
