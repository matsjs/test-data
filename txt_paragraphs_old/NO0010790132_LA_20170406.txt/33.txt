(a) No Bondholder is entitled to take any enforcement action, instigate any insolvency procedures, or take other action against the Issuer or any other party in relation to any of the liabilities of the Issuer or any other party under or in connection with the Finance Documents, other than through the Bond Trustee and in accordance with these Bond Terms, provided, however, that the Bondholders shall not be restricted from exercising any of their individual rights derived from these Bond Terms, including the right to exercise the Put Option.
3.3 Bondholders' rights
(a) If a beneficial owner of a Bond not being registered as a Bondholder wishes to exercise any rights under the Finance Documents, it must obtain proof of ownership of the Bonds, acceptable to the Bond Trustee.
(b) A Bondholder (whether registered as such or proven to the Bond Trustee's satisfaction to be the beneficial owner of the Bond as set out in paragraph (a) above) may issue one or more powers of attorney to third parties to represent it in relation to some or all of the Bonds held or beneficially owned by such Bondholder. The Bond Trustee shall only have to examine the face of a power of attorney or similar evidence of authorisation that has been provided to it pursuant to this Clause 3.3 (Bondholders' rights) and may assume that it is in full force and effect, unless otherwise is apparent from its face or the Bond Trustee has actual knowledge to the contrary.

ADMISSION TO LISTING
The Issuer shall procure that the Bonds are listed on Oslo Børs, or another Exchange, not later than one (1) year after the Issue Date and shall take all measures required to ensure that
18 (51)
the Bonds, once listed on Oslo Børs or another Exchange, continue being listed on Oslo Børs or another Exchange for as long as any Bond is outstanding (however, taking into account the rules and regulations of Oslo Børs, or another regulated market, and the Paying Agent (as amended from time to time) preventing trading in the Bonds in close connection to the redemption of the Bonds).
