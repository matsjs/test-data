The provisions described above that require the Exchange Notes Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Exchange Notes Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Exchange Notes Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Exchange Notes to require that the Exchange Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the Exchange Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.
The ability of the Exchange Notes Issuer to repurchase Exchange Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The Senior Secured Notes contain, and future Indebtedness of the Exchange Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Exchange Notes of their right to require the Exchange Notes Issuer to repurchase the Exchange Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Exchange Notes Issuer. Finally, the ability of the Exchange Notes Issuer to pay cash to the holders of the Exchange Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by its then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.
The Exchange Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Exchange Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Exchange Notes Issuer and purchases all Exchange Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Exchange Notes Indenture as described above under the caption ` `-- O p tio n a l R e d e m p tio n ", unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.
The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of ``all or substantially all'' of the properties or assets of the Exchange Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ``substantially all'', there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Exchange Notes to require the Exchange Notes Issuer to repurchase its Exchange Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Exchange Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.
The provisions under the Exchange Notes Indenture relating to the Exchange Notes Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Exchange Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Exchange Notes prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control.
If and for so long as the Exchange Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Exchange Notes Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the L u x e m b u rg e r W ort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
