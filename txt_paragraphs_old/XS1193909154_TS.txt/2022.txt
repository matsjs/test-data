A defined benefit plan is one which defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group makes fixed contributions to a separate entity.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets,

together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and unrecognised past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and which have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability, or alternatively a government bond interest rate if such bonds do not exist.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions in excess of the greater of 10% of the value of plan assets or 10% of the defined benefit obligation are allocated to income over the em ployees' expected average remaining working lives.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
