(2) Includes a 520,000 ton capacity reduction by Stora Enso in the first half of 2014, a 60,000 ton capacity reduction by Fabryka Papiere Myszkow in the first quarter of 2014 and an expected 805,000 ton capacity reduction by UPM in the first quarter of 2015.
A significant amount of closures have taken place or been announced over the past year. In Europe, for example, approximately 600,000 tons of capacity reductions have taken place. Furthermore, in November 2014, UPM announced approximately 800,000 tons of additional capacity closures that are expected to take place in the first quarter of 2015. Similarly, in North America, approximately 1,300,000 tons of closures are expected to have occurred by the end of first quarter of 2015.
Newsprint
In 2013, Western European newsprint capacity decreased by 9.3%, with 790,000 tons removed from the market. The majority of the newsprint volume decline was the result of the closure of five paper machines, of which three were closed by Stora Enso. On an annual basis, the three closures removed a combined 655,000 tons of capacity. The Burgo Group and Holmen AB also carried out significant capacity reductions. In addition, some large changes in grade mix at several mills resulted in lower newsprint capacity. The recent announcement of closures by UPM is expected to further reduce newsprint capacity by an additional 345,000 tons in the first quarter of 2015.
