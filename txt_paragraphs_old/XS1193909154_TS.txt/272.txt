Credit risk
We make a credit evaluation of all financial trading counterparties. Based on the evaluation, a limit on credit exposure is established for each counterparty. These limits are monitored continuously in relation to unrealized profit on financial instruments and placements. The maximum credit risk arising from financial instruments is represented by the carrying am ount of financial assets on our balance sheet. This includes derivatives with positive market value except for embedded derivatives. Embedded derivatives are not subjected to credit risk, as there are no future cash flows associated with such derivatives.
We trade with a group of large Nordic and international banks which are publicly rated in the interval from A A - to A - (unchanged from 2012). The credit risk on deposits and derivative transactions is spread across theses banks.
