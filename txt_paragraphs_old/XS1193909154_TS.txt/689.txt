 it is an unfair preference;
 it was granted (or an act was done to give effect to it) when the company was insolvent (or the company became insolvent as a result of entry into (or giving effect to) the transaction); and
 it was granted into during the six months prior to the liquidator's appointment.

A security interest could be declared void if a liquidator establishes to a Court that:
 it is an uncommercial transaction;
 it was granted (or an act was done to give effect to it) when the company was insolvent (or the company became insolvent as a result of entry into (or giving effect to) the transaction); and
 it was granted during the two years prior to the liquidators' appointment.
