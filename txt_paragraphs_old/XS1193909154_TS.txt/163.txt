Changes in reporting segments
Effective January 1, 2014, we reorganized our operations into two geographically-oriented operating segments: Publication Paper Europe and Publication Paper Australasia. During the years ended December 31,2013 and 2012, we had previously organized our operating segments by geography and product class in three operating segments: Newsprint Europe, Newsprint Outside Europe and Magazine Paper. The two Newsprint segments reported figures for the newsprint assets located in Europe and the rest of the world, respectively, and the results of our European magazine paper operations were reported under Magazine Paper. Prior to 2012, in addition to our two Newsprint operating segments and our Magazine Paper operating segment, we maintained an Energy operating segment. The activities of the Energy operating segment have been included in our financial reporting under Other Activities with effect from January 1, 2012.
In these listing particulars, we have presented our financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to reflect the retrospective effect of the January 1, 2014 change to operating segments as if such change had occurred January 1,2013. We have not prepared or presented in these listing particulars operating segment information reflecting the retrospective effect of the January 1,2014 change to operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012.
In this discussion, in order to enhance the comparability of the results of operations for our operating segments, the segment financial information for the year ended December 31,2011 has been presented to give effect to the January 1,2012 elimination of the Energy operating segment and the inclusion of the Energy operating segment's prior activities within Other Activities as if such change had occurred with effect from January 1, 2011.
The comparability of the operating segment financial data for the years ended December 31,2011 and 2012 is also impacted by the reclassification of the results of operations of the Parenco mill (whose single paper mill had the capability to produce both newsprint and magazine paper). During 2011, the results of operations of the Parenco mill were reported in the Newsprint Europe operating segment; during 2012, the Parenco mill's results of operations were reported in the Magazine Paper operating segment. The Parenco mill was disposed of in August 2012.
Significant disposals or reductions in capacity
During the periods under review, as part of our strategy to streamline and refocus our business, we have disposed of a number of our businesses and assets and reduced production capacity through permanent closures:
· D is p o s a l o f B ra z ilia n P isa o p e ra tio n s (2 0 1 3 ). We sold a majority interest in the Pisa business in Brazil, which had an annual production capacity of 185,000 tons in June 2013 and sold the remaining 49% minority interest in 2014.
· D is p o s a l o f T h a ila n d S in g b u r i o p e ra tio n s (2 0 1 3 ). We sold the Singburi newsprint mill in Thailand in November 2013.
