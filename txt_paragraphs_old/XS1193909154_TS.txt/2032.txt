The change means that it is no longer required to show all items that are included in comprehensive income in the statement of changes in group equity. These may instead appear as a single sum. The group has previously presented the statement of changes in equity in accordance with the am ended standard, and the change has therefore not affected the presentation in the financial statements.
The am endm ent removes the requirement for government-related entities to disclose details of all transactions with the government and other government-related entities. It also clarifies and simplifies the definition of a related party. The am endm ent has not had a material impact on the disclosures given in the financial statements.

The change clarifies the information requirement relating to financial instruments, and has not had a material impact on the disclosures given in the financial statements.
IAS 32 F in a n c ia l in s tr u m e n ts -- p r e s e n t a t io n ( a m e n d m e n t ) The am endm ent concerns rights issues in foreign currencies. When the functional currency is different from the nominal currency of the shares, the standard opens for rights issues in the nominal currency of the shares not having to be classified as liabilities. The group does not have such instruments, and the am endm ent has therefore not had any impact on the financial statements.
