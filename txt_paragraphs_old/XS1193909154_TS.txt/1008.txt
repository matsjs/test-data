NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Different conceptual industry scenarios is considered in the impairment testing. By interpolation between the different conceptual scenarios, all possible outcomes are implicitly considered. The different scenarios are weighted by an estimated probability assigned to each outcome. The impairment testing at 31 December 2014 was based on the operating plan for the group for 2015 as approved by the board of directors.
Sensitivity to estimates of recoverable amount
The estimation of recoverable amount is based on assumptions regarding the future development of several factors. These include price development for finished goods, sales volumes, currency rates and interest rates. This means that there will be uncertainty when it comes to the outcome of these calculations. Norske Skog has performed sensitivity analyses using the variables mentioned above to predict how fluctuations would influence recoverable amount. In relation to the assumptions made in the calculation of the present value of future cash flows, recoverable amount is most sensitive to changes in prices of finished goods, sales volumes and the discount rate used. Assuming that the current profit level remains for the key assets, there will be no impairment. A reduction in sales price and sales volumes for the whole group in the cash flow period of 5% will cause a reduction in recoverable amount in the order of NOK 3 200 million and NOK 1 300 million respectively. Correspondingly, a 1% increase in the discount rate will cause a reduction in the recoverable amount of NOK 700 million. An appreciation of NOK of 1% against all other functional currencies in the Norske Skog group will cause a reduction in the recoverable amount of NOK 200 million.
