Operating expenses in 2013 decreased by 17.4% to NOK 12,477 million, from NOK 15,108 million in 2012. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses increased from 91.0% of operating revenue in 2012 to 93.5% of operating revenue in 2013. The reduction in operating expenses in 2013 was due to lower production and sales volumes stemming from our disposals and closures of capacity. Production volumes decreased by 14.5% in 2013 as compared to 2012.
D is trib u tio n c o s ts . Distribution costs decreased in 2013 by 15.0% to NOK 1,398 million from NOK 1,645 million in 2012, which the reflected the impact of disposals and capacity closures. As a percentage of operating revenue, distribution costs increased from 9.9% of operating revenue in 2012 to 10.5% of operating revenue in 2013. This increase in distribution costs relative to operating revenues was primarily due to the change in customer mix and location relative to our continuing portfolio operations following capacity closures and disposals in 2012 and 2013.
C o s t o f m a te ria ls . Cost of materials decreased in 2013 by 16.2% to NOK 8,017 million from NOK 9,564 million in 2012. As a percentage of operating revenue, cost of materials increased from 57.6% of operating revenue in 2012 to 60.1% of operating revenue in 2013. The decrease in the total cost of materials was principally due to reductions in capacity due to our disposals and capacity closures. The increase in costs of materials relative to our operating revenue reflects the impact of generally higher per unit energy costs in Europe due to new contracts and higher per unit wood costs for our magazine paper operations.
