Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under ``-- C e rta in C o v e n a n ts -- Im p a irm e n t o f S e c u r ity In te re s t" and "-- C e rta in C o v e n a n ts -- L ie n s ,'' the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness, including Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture.
The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Note Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute Collateral.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets may not be secured or such security perfected in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including (without limitation):
 if the cost of providing security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the holders and the other secured parties;
 if providing such security requires consent of a third party and, if the asset is material, such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors;
 if providing such security would be prohibited by applicable law, general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, ``thin capitalization'' rules or similar matters or entering into the Security Documents would conflict with the fiduciary duties of directors, contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of directors or officers; and
 if perfecting such security would have an unreasonable adverse effect on the ability of the security grantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by this Indenture.
The assets that comprise the Collateral may also secure on a first-ranking basis certain future Hedging Obligations, certain of which may be entitled to payment from the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes, and may also secure any Additional Notes and certain future other Indebtedness. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Notes.
