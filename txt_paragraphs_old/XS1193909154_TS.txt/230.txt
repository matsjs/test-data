M a g a z in e P a pe r. Operating revenue from our Magazine Paper segment in 2012 decreased by 0.6% to NOK 6,254 million compared to NOK 6,291 million in 2011. The decrease in operating revenues reflected weaker pricing for magazine paper in 2012 as compared to 2011. Total volume of magazine paper sold in 2012 increased by 11.0% to 1,308,000 tons, compared to 1,178,000 tons in 2011. The increase in sales volumes reflected the net impact of the reclassification of the Parenco mill operations and the consolidation of its results within the Magazine Paper operating segment and the resumption of production at the Saugsbrug mill which had undergone repairs following a fire at the mill in February 2011. Demand for uncoated and coated mechanical paper in Europe fell 5.0% and 8.0%, respectively, in 2012 as compared to 2011. Prices for magazine paper in Europe were also relatively stable, but declined slightly in 2012 as compared to 2011.
