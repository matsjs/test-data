The gain on divestments of business activities, property, plant and equipment in 2012 of NOK 39 million was primarily related to the divestments of Papeles Norske Skog Bio Bio S.A. in Chile, Norske Skog Follum AS in Norway, Norske Skog Parenco B.V, in the Netherlands and the global recovered paper business, Reparco (in total NOK 38 million).

The gain on em bedded derivatives in 2012 and 2011 was mainly driven by currency fluctuations.
