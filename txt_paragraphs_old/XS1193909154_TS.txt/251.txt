Net cash flow used in operating activities for the nine months September 30, 2014 was negatively impacted by a high level of payments made for restructuring activities during the period, but positively impacted by the release of working capital following the closure of a paper machine at the Walsum mill in December 2013 and the transfer of our marketing and sales operations for publication paper in the Asian markets to NorCell Asia under a new long-term marketing agreement with CellMark AB.

Cash flow from operating activities was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower gross operating earnings in 2013 and the strong positive impact in 2012 from the release of working capital following the disposals of the Follum mill and the Parenco mill.
