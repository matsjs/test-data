 any transaction (R e c h ts g e s c h a ft) effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors of the debtor, or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable if it was entered into, can be avoided if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid and the other party to the transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the debtor and the other party to the transaction had knowledge of either the debtor's illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction;
 any act performed by the debtor, including the granting of guarantees and security interest, during a period of 10 years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, if the debtor acted with the intention to prejudice its creditors can be avoided if the other party had knowledge of such intention at the time of such act;
 any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was concluded within two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other

party had no knowledge of the debtor's intention to disadvantage its creditors; in terms of corporate entities, the term ``related party'' includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor's share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;
 any act that provides security or satisfaction for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan (G e s e lls c h a fte rd a rle h e n ) or an economically equivalent claim can be avoided;
 (i) in the event it provided security, if the act was effected in the last 10 years prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter or (ii) in the event it resulted in satisfaction, if the act was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; or
 a transaction whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party can be avoided if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and if a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (B u rg e ) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).
In this context, ``knowledge'' is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., an entity subject to the German insolvency laws) was subject to illiquidity, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor's intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor's imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor's creditors. With respect to a ``related party'', there is a general statutory presumption that such party had knowledge.
