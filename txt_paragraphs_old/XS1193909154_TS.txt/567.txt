(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official interpretation or application of such laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which amendment or change has not been publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of these listing particulars (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of these listing particulars, such later date).
The Exchange Notes Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Exchange Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Exchange Notes or any Exchange Note Guarantees were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Exchange Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Exchange Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that there has been such amendment or change which would entitle the Exchange Notes Issuer to redeem the Exchange Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Exchange Notes Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Exchange Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by the Exchange Notes Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it.
232
The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.
The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Exchange Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Exchange Notes Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Exchange Notes Indenture.
For the avoidance of doubt, the implementation of European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive will not be a change or amendment for such purposes.
Mandatory Redemption
The Exchange Notes Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Exchange Notes.
