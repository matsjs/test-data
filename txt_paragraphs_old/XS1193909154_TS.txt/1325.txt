NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Norske Skog has recognised an amount in the balance sheet as a result of the termination of a large part of the fair value hedge portfolio in the first half of 2009. A hedge reserve (deferred income) amounting to NOK 173 million is included in interest-bearing debt at 30 September 2014. The corresponding figure at 30 June 2014 was NOK 172 million.
The hedge reserve does not constitute any payment obligation for the group, but will be amortised in the income statement over the lifetime of the debt that has been hedged.
