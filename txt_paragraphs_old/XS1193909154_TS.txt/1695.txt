The group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available for sale. This classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. M anagem ent determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. A financial asset is classified in this category if it was acquired principally for the purpose of short-term sale or if so designated by management. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

Norske Skog currently has energy contracts in Norway that do not meet the own use criteria according to IAS 39.5. The contracts must therefore be treated as derivatives and are booked to fair value through profit or loss (see also Notes 7, 8 and 9). Commodity contracts within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as current assets, unless they are expected to be realised more than 12 months after the balance sheet date. In that case, they are classified as non-current assets.
