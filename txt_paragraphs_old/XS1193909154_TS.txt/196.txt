We recognized tax expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 of NOK 105 million, compared to tax income of NOK 360 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The change in income tax was primarily due to reduced loss before income taxes, reduced deferred tax assets in Norway and re-assessment of tax positions in the Group during the nine months ended September 30, 2014.
Net loss was NOK 296 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to a net loss of NOK 1,387 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013.
