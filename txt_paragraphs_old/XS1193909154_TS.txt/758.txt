· the judgment is not irreconcilable with a judgment given in Germany or a previous, recognizable foreign judgment recognition in Germany or the proceedings leading to such judgment are irreconcilable with proceedings that were filed (re c h ts h a n g ig ) in Germany previously;
· the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with the substantial foundations of German law (e.g. o rd re p u b lic ) , including without limitation, fundamental rights (G ru n d re c h te ) guaranteed by virtue of the German Basic Law (G ru n d g e s e tz ); and
· generally, the guarantee of reciprocity.
Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having received an enforcement or exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful under all circumstances. In particular, the remedies need to be of a specific kind and type for which an enforcement procedure exists under German law. Also, if circumstances have arisen after the date on which such foreign judgment became res judicata, a defence against execution may arise.
If an original action is brought before a German court, and the court does not decline jurisdiction, the court may apply not only EU and German rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of the EU and German law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions, particularly those relating to certain remedies, if the relevant application violates German public policy.
In particular, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages is usually denied by German courts as incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.
Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditor's rights generally.
German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.
