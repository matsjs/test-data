Austria
One of the Guarantors, Norske Skog Bruck GmbH, is organized under the laws of Austria, and has its centre of main interest in Austria or, at least has assets located in Austria (``Austrian Guarantor''). Therefore in the event of insolvency of the Austrian Guarantor insolvency proceedings governed by Austrian law, in particular by the Austrian Insolvency Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 337/1914 as last amended by Federal Law Gazette No. 69/2014; In s o lv e n z o rd n u n g ), may be opened in Austria.
The Austrian Insolvency Act regulates on the one hand the liquidation proceedings concerning legal entities in which a debtor's assets or the company as a whole are sold and the resulting proceeds are distributed among its creditors. On the other hand it provides restructuring proceedings enabling the debtor to discharge its liabilities with quota payments and to continue its activities under certain conditions. The insolvency laws of Austria may not be as favorable to your interests as a creditor as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions. Your ability to recover payments due on the Notes under the
314
Austrian Insolvency Act may therefore be limited to a greater extent than under the insolvency laws governing other Guarantors or the Issuer.
The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Austrian insolvency law.
The Austrian Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung)
Insolvency proceedings (In s o lv e n z v e rfa h re n ) must be opened by the competent court upon application by the debtor or a creditor whenever a company is (i) illiquid (z a h lu n g s u n fa h ig ), i.e., unable to pay its debts in due time, (ii) or is over-indebted in terms of insolvency law (in s o lv e n z re c h tlic h u b e rs c h u ld e t), i.e., when the liabilities exceed its assets at liquidation values (re c h n e ris c h e U b e rs c h u ld u n g ) and the company has a negative prospect for its continued existence (n e g a tiv e F o rtb e s te h e n s p ro g n o s e ). In addition, restructuring proceedings (S a n ie ru n g s v e rfa h re n ) may also be initiated, if the risk of the debtor's inability to pay its debts is at least imminent (d ro h e n d e Z a h lu n g s u n fa h ig k e it) and the debtor files an application for the opening of such proceedings.
If a restructuring plan (S a n ie ru n g s p la n ) offering a quota of at least 20% to the unsecured creditors within a maximum of two years is presented together with the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings, the insolvency proceedings will be initiated as restructuring proceedings; if no such restructuring plan is presented with the insolvency proceedings application, the insolvency proceedings will be initiated as bankruptcy proceedings (K o n k u rs v e rfa h re n ). A debtor may also present such a restructuring plan in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding whereby the bankruptcy proceeding will be continued as a restructuring proceeding.
