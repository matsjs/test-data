Claims which may be preferred under applicable laws (which are not specific to security over land) include:
 claims relating to the taking of further advances, being rules which provide priority to a later security interest to the extent that the holder of the earlier security interest made subsequent advances in circumstances where it had notice of the later security (although there are a number of exceptions to this under general law and under some of the State and Territory Torrens title regimes);
 interests in relation to circulating Security Interests and floating charges (discussed above); and  in some cases, liens arising by operation of law.
Enforcement of Torrens title mortgages
Under the Mortgages, subject to any agreed priority arrangements, the Security Agent will be entitled to enforce the mortgages following a declared default. It may need to give applicable statutory notices and wait until expiry of applicable grace periods.
Enforcement action available in relation to the Mortgages may include:  becoming a mortgagee-in-possession of the property;
 exercising a power of sale in respect of the property; or  appointing a receiver to the mortgagor.
