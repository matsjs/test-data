As a result of the termination of a large part of the fair value hedge portfolio in the beginning of 2009, an amount was reclassified in the balance sheet. A hedge reserve (deferred income) amounting to NOK 270 million is included in interest-bearing debt as at 31 Decem ber 2011 (NOK 338 million at 31 Decem ber 2010). The hedge reserve does not constitute any payment obligation for the group, but will be amortised in the income statement over the term of the debt that has been hedged.
At 31 Decem ber 2011, the group's holding of its own bonds amounted to NOK 361 million of Norwegian bonds (NOK 334 million at 31 Decem ber 2010). The group's holding of own bonds in foreign currency amounted to USD 29 million and EUR 63 million, respectively (USD 125 million and EUR 7 million at 31 Decem ber 2010). This is deducted from interest-bearing debt in NOK.
LOAN COVENANTS
In the second quarter of 2011, the credit facility of EUR 400 million was repaid. In the same quarter, Norske Skog signed a new three-year credit facility of EUR 140 million and a Euro-denominated bond loan of EUR 150 million with a maturity of five years. The loan terms were later renegotiated.

11. INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES (Continued)
The loan covenants in the group's credit facility of EUR 140 million are linked, among other things, to the interest coverage ratio (EBITDA / net interest expense) and the debt ratio (net interest-bearing debt / EBITDA). According to the agreement, all key figures are calculated using a 12-month average exchange rate. The group's bond loan does not include financial covenants.
