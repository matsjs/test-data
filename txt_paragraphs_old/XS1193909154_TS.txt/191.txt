E m p lo y e e b e n e fit e x p e n s e s . Employee benefit expenses decreased by 7.1% to NOK 1,435 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 from NOK 1,544 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. As a percentage of operating revenue, employee benefit expenses increased from 15.7% of operating revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to 16.1% of operating revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The decrease in employee benefit expenses was primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and the effect of disposals of non-European facilities during 2013, including Pisa and Singburi and the closure of one paper machine at Walsum. We had 2,944 employees as of September 30, 2014 compared to 3,531 employees as of September 30, 2013.

nine months ended September 30, 2014 by 14.4% to NOK 685 million from NOK 800 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. As a percentage of operating revenue, other operating expenses decreased from 8.2% of operating revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to 7.7% of operating revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The reduction in other operating expenses is primarily attributable to reduced maintenance and other operating expenses stemming from the closure of one paper machine at Walsum and the effects of the conversion of one paper machine at the Boyer mill to magazine paper.
Gross operating earnings
Gross operating earnings (operating earnings before depreciation, restructuring expenses, other gains and losses and impairments) were NOK 612 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to NOK 564 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, an increase of 8.5%. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross operating earnings increased from 5.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to 6.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The increase in gross operating earnings was primarily due to somewhat higher prices in Europe more than offsetting the negative short-term impact of the closure of one Walsum paper machine and conversion of one paper machine at the Boyer mill.
E u ro p e . Gross operating earnings were NOK 452 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to NOK 167 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, an increase of 170.7%, primarily due to improved paper prices in Europe, positive currency effects and reduced fixed costs resulting from the closure of one paper machine at our Walsum mill. Gross operating earnings increased as a percentage of segment operating revenue from 2.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to 6.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 primarily due to improved pricing for publication paper in Europe.
A u s tra la s ia . Gross operating earnings were NOK 195 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to NOK 453 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, a decrease of 57.0%, primarily due to the disposal of our operations in Thailand and Brazil and the short term negative impact of the conversion of one newsprint machine to magazine paper at the Boyer mill. Gross operating earnings decreased as a percentage of segment operating revenue from 15.0% in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to 8.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, which reflects the impact of the disposal of profitable operations in Brazil as well as lower newsprint pricing.
O th e r A c tiv itie s . Gross operating earnings were negative NOK 35 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, an improvement on the gross operating earnings of negative NOK 56 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The improvement was primarily attributable to reduced costs of corporate functions.
