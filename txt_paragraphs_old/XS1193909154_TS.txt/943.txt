a) Pension obligations
A defined benefit plan is one which defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and which have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability, or alternatively a government bond interest rate if such bonds do not exist.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. These contributions are made to publicly- or privately-administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been made. These contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the period the contribution is related to. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
