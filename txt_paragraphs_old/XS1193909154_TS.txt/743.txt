The PPSA also regulates the enforcement of Security Interests in collateral by secured parties. The secured party and the debtor can agree to contract out of certain of the debtor's statutory rights that would otherwise apply on enforcement and this shall be reflected in the New Zealand law security agreements entered into by the New Zealand Guarantor and its shareholder.
