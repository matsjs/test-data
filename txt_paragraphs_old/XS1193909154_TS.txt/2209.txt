LONG-TERM OW NERSHIP PLAN
The board adopted new principles for the long-term incentive programme in 2007, whereby the criteria for awarding synthetic shares to corporate managem ent is related to Total Shareholder Return (TSR-- development of the share price including dividend payments), such that this must be above average for a defined group of 16 listed paper manufacturers, including Norske Skog. A positive TSR for the period is also an absolute condition. This scheme will yield a 30% payout if Norske Skog performs better than the average for the reference group and a full payout if the com pany falls within the best quartile. The maximum annual payouts are 35 000 synthetic shares for the CEO and 17 500 for other members of corporate management, subject to a ceiling of 1.25 times the annual salary in the relevant year. At least 50% of the allocation (after tax) from this programme must be applied to purchasing shares, which must be retained until the total shareholding corresponds to a gross annual salary. Progress is measured over a three-year period, with a new period beginning each year. This scheme involves no dilution effect.
