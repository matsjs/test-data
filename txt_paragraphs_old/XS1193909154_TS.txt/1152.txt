FINANCE LEASES
Leases of property, plant and equipment where control and substantially all the risks have been transferred to the group are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and net present value of the minimum lease payments. The capitalised value is depreciated on a linear basis over the estimated economic life.
