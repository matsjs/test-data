Our Saugbrugs mill in Norway produces super-calendared magazine paper and has three paper machines. Total production capacity and utilization at our Saugbrugs mill were 530,000 tons and 86%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,2013, with an actual production of 457,000 tons. Our Saugbrugs mill has a long-term power contract until 2020 for delivery of 1.01 TWh of electricity annually, which is sufficient to cover approximately 91% of its expected annual energy consumption. The machines at our Saugbrugs mill use internally produced mechanical pulp and purchased chemical pulp in the manufacturing process. In 2013 and 2014, we invested in a new TMP plant, which improves the consumption of energy and chemical pulp at the Saugbrugs mill. As of June 30, 2014, the new TMP plant was fully operating at the projected efficiency level.
