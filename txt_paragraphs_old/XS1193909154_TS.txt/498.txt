Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts) or premium, if any, on, such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;
(2) the Issuer's obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;
(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer's and the Guarantors' obligations in connection therewith; and
(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.
In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation to make Change of Control Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Indenture (``Covenant Defeasance'') and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all Events of Default described under ``-- E v e n ts o f D e fa u lt a n d R e m e d ie s " (except those relating to payments on the Notes or, solely with respect to the Issuer, bankruptcy or insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:
(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in euros, non-callable Euro Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euros and non-callable Euro Government Obligations, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts and premium, if any) on the outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a particular redemption date;
(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of United States counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
