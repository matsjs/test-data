Provisions for environmental restoration, dismantling costs, restructuring activities and legal claims are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, an outflow of resources is more likely than not to be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Salary which is earned while the employee contributes to the ongoing operations is not classified as restructuring costs. This includes for example salary in the notice period when the employee is working during the notice period, or bonuses earned whilst the employee contributes to the normal operations. These are booked as normal salary costs. Costs for projects related to improvements are generally ordinary operating costs.

likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised within Financial items.
