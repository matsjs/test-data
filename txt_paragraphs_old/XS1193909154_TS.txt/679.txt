All of the debtor's assets will in practice be seized by the bankruptcy estate, and the debtor may not dispose of the seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The bankruptcy estate may also seize assets held by third-parties, if these assets are acquired from the debtor in an
unlawful manner, or if the acquisition lacks legal protection, or if the transaction can be reversed according to the Recovery Act. The bankruptcy estate is a separate legal entity, which is authorized to exercise all ownership interests and rights with respect to the seized assets, including, but not limited to, the realization of assets.
Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value of the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured creditors may, in principle, realize the security, and cover their claims; however, keeping in mind that the realization of a number of categories of security during the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy estate (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate has the right, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, to realize the security with a wiping out effect on unmet liens and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and other holding legal rights in the assets.
Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien of up to 5% of the estimated value or sales value of all assets secured by the debtor for its own debt or by a third-party for the debtor's indebtedness. Such statutory lien is not applicable to financial security (cash deposits and financial instruments) established pursuant to the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act No. 17/2004 (the ``Financial Collateral Act'') or the Norwegian Liens Act No. 2/1980 section 6-4 (9).
Any under-secured amount (any amount exceeding the value of the assets securing the relevant creditor's claim) will be deemed an ordinary (unsecured) trade claim.
In a Norwegian bankruptcy, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority:
· secured claims (valid and perfected security covered up to the value of the secured asset--either after the realization by the secured creditor itself or after realization undertaken by the bankruptcy estate);
· super-priority claims (claims that arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidator's costs and obligations of the estate);
· salary claims (within certain limitations);
