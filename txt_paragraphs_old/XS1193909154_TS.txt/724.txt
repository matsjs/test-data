Accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
The accelerated safeguard proceeding has effect against pre-insolvency creditors that have to file a proof of claim (see below) and as a consequence trade creditors notably will be involved in the accelerated safeguard proceedings, whereas accelerated financial safeguard proceedings only involve financial creditors (i.e. members of the credit institutions committee and the bondholders' general
328
assembly), with no impact on suppliers or public creditors notably (who will thus continue to be paid according to their applicable contract terms and are not subject to the automatic stay applicable during the observation period).
The regime applicable to accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is similar to the one applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings (which is now designed as the common accelerated proceeding, the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings being a variety of the latter, designed to ``fast-track'' purely financial difficulties).
To be eligible to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfill the following conditions:
· the debtor must be subject to ongoing c o n c ilia tio n proceedings when it applies for the opening of the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings;
· the debtor must not be insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of c o n c ilia tio n ;
· as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not in a position to overcome;
