The appointment of a receiver does not create a moratorium in relation to the company or its assets and other creditors can continue to enforce their rights and remedies against the company or its assets subject to the prior ranking rights of the secured creditor.
The receiver owes residual duties to the company, its sureties, unsecured creditors and shareholders to have reasonable regard to the interests of those persons.
S tatutory m an ag em en t
A statutory manager may be appointed to a New Zealand company pursuant to the New Zealand Corporations (Investigations and Management) Act 1989. Statutory managers are only rarely appointed in cases of corporate insolvency.
Statutory managers are appointed where it is considered by the New Zealand Financial Markets Authority that the company is acting fraudulently or recklessly or that it is necessary to protect the interests of shareholders or creditors or for any other reason in the public interest and such interests cannot be adequately protected in another way.
While a company is under statutory management, there is a moratorium which prevents any proceedings or enforcement action being taken or continued by any person (including secured creditors) against the corporation without the statutory manager's consent. There is also a prohibition on the transfer or removal of any assets of the company without the statutory manager's consent.

A statutory manager has broad powers to manage and carry on the business of the company, challenge insolvent transactions, terminate certain contracts, disclaim onerous property, compromise claims and sell its assets and/or business.
A statutory manager is also entitled to suspend, in whole or in part, the payment of any debts or the discharge of any obligation. There is no limit on the period during which the moratorium or suspension may continue.
