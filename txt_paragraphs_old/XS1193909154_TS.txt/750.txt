A rarely used process in the insolvency of companies is a Court-approved compromise, a scheme of arrangement or an amalgamation under Part 15 of the New Zealand Companies Act 1993. Part 15 allows a compromise to be approved by the Court outside of the Part 14 process discussed under ``Creditors' Compromises'' section above.

A liquidator must ascertain and realise the company's assets. Where a company is placed in liquidation its recent transactions will in the normal course be placed under scrutiny by the liquidator. A liquidator has wide statutory powers to do this. As an example, and as discussed in more detail below, a liquidator has the power to void certain insolvent transactions between the company and a creditor, void certain security granted by a company in favor of a creditor, recover any excess paid by a company to a creditor in a transaction at an undervalue and make a claim against a director who has breached his or her duties under the Companies Act.
Upon liquidation, existing court proceedings are automatically stayed, and proceedings against the company cannot be commenced or continued without leave of the court or the liquidator's consent.

The liquidator has the ability to set aside insolvent transactions entered into during the specified period. An insolvent transaction is one entered into when the company is unable to pay its due debts and which enables a person to receive more than would have been likely in liquidation. The specified period is two years before the date of commencement of the liquidation (``specified period''). In respect of transactions occurring within the six months prior to the commencement of the liquidation (the ``restricted period''), there is a presumption that the company was insolvent at the time the transaction occurred.
