Liquidity risk
In order to uncover future liquidity risk, Norske Skog forecasts both short- and long-term cash flows. Cash flow forecasts include cash flows stemming from operations, investments, financing activities and financial instruments. The group had current investments, cash and cash equivalents of NOK 1 200 million at 31 D ecem ber 2011 (NOK 4 440 million at 31 Decem ber 2010) and an undrawn credit facility of NOK 1 086 million at 31 Decem ber 2011 (fully drawn credit facilities of NOK 3 125 million at 31 Decem ber 2010). See Note 11 for more information regarding the maturity of facilities.
The following table shows the contractual maturities of non-derivative financial liabilities and other derivative financial instruments. All amounts disclosed in the table are undiscounted cash flows. Furthermore, amounts denominated in foreign currency are translated to NOK using closing rates at 31 December. These amounts consist of trade payables, interest payments and principal payments on derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. Variable rate interest cash flows are calculated using the forward yield curve. Projected interest payments are based on the maturity schedule at 31 Decem ber without accounting for forecasted refinancing and/or other changes in the liability portfolio. All other cash flows are based on the group's positions held at 31 Decem ber 2011.
