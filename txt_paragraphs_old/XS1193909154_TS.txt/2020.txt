Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

2. ACCO UNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued)
B o rro w in g s
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowing, using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities, unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Interest costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Bond loans
The value of bond loans in the balance sheet is reduced by holdings of Norske Skog bonds. Amounts above or below amortised costs upon re-purchase are recognised in the income statement in the same period the re-purchase occurs.
