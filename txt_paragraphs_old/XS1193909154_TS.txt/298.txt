Newsprint
Newsprint is low cost, short life-cycle paper that is mostly used to print daily and weekly newspapers and advertising inserts. It is designed for use on printing presses that employ a long web of paper rather than individual sheets. Newsprint is mainly used by publishers and printers due to its low cost relative to other paper grades. The demand for optical and printability properties is lower than for other printing and writing papers, and the main requirements are sufficient strength to run through modern high-speed web printing presses and the ability to accept four-color printing at qualities that meet the needs of typical newspaper advertisers. Newsprint is manufactured mainly from recycled fiber or mechanical pulp, but may also be manufactured from bleached chemical pulp.

Magazine papers Magazine paper is generally of higher quality than newsprint and can be either uncoated or coated. The specific grade of magazine paper chosen depends on the print quality needed (e.g. due to magazine appearance). Coated mechanical papers have a thin layer of coating on both sides that provides a glossy finish and have better printing properties and appearance. Generally, coated mechanical paper is used for magazines, brochures, catalogs, advertising materials and promotional products. Magazine papers are produced mainly from mechanical pulp and recycled fiber, but may also from bleached chemical pulp.
