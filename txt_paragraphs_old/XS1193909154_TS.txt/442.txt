 be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under ``-- S e c u rity " ;
 rank p a r i p a s s u in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;
 rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; and
 be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness.
The Note Guarantees will be subject to certain limitations, including, among other things, general statutory limitations, capital maintenance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, ``thin capitalization'' rules, retention of title claims and similar principles.
