If any of the Mortgages are to be registered as second ranking in respect of any land, a priority arrangement with the first ranking mortgagee may be required to regulate, among other things, decision making, enforcement rights and the sharing of enforcement proceeds.
As noted above, if a Torrens title mortgage is not registered, it will take effect as an equitable mortgage and would be subject to, among other things:
 prior legal interests acquired for value without actual or constructive notice of the security and interests registered under the Torrens title regime with respect to the mortgaged property;
 prior equitable interests (with some exceptions);
 a later equitable interest if the mortgagee has engaged in postponing conduct (being conduct such as fraud or gross negligence which allowed the creation of the subsequent interest); and
 certain claims preferred by applicable laws (discussed below).
Claims which may be preferred under applicable laws (which are not specific to security over land) include:
 statutory charges which legislation provides will take priority over existing registered interests (such as a charge on the land to secure unpaid rates or land tax);
