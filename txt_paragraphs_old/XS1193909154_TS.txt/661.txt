The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds Notes will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Prospective purchasers that are entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes should consult their tax advisers concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them and their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by the partnership.
THE SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET OUT BELOW IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE RELIED UPON BY PURCHASERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED UNDER THE
286
U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF ACQUIRING, OWNING, AND DISPOSING OF THE NOTES, INCLUDING, THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN TAX LAW.
Treatment of the Notes
In certain circumstances (i) the Temporary Notes Issuer may be required to redeem a portion of the Temporary Notes for cash and (ii) the Issuer may be obligated to make additional payments on the Notes in excess of the stated interest and principal amount (e.g., as described under ``D e s c r ip tio n o f th e S e n io r S e c u r e d N o te s -- A d d itio n a lA m o u n ts " ). The possibility of such redemption and/or such payments could be viewed as causing the Notes to be treated as ``contingent payment debt instruments'' for U.S. federal income tax purposes (``CPDIs''). If the Notes were to be treated as CPDIs, U.S. Holders may be required to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes at different times and in different amounts than described below, to treat any income realized on a taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than capital gain, and to suffer other adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences. Although the issue is not free from doubt, the Issuer intends to take the position (to the extent it is required to do so) that the Notes should not be treated as CPDIs. Our determination that the Notes should not be treated as CPDIs is binding on a holder unless the holder discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable regulations. Prospective purchasers of the Notes are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences in the event the Notes were to be treated as CPDIs. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be so treated.
Treatment of the Exchange of Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes
Following the Proposed Exchange Offers and Proposed Consent Solicitations, an amount of Temporary Notes will be exchanged for Senior Secured Notes and a portion of the Temporary Notes may be redeemed for cash. Depending upon the terms of this exchange and possible redemption, including whether the entire amount of Temporary Notes are exchanged for Senior Secured Notes, it is possible that the Exchange could be treated as a taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as discussed in more detail below.
