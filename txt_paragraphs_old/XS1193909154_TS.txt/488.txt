Limitations on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness
The Parent Guarantor will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, Guarantee any Indebtedness in excess of 10.0 million unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture providing for a Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary on a joint and several basis with each other Guarantor (if any), which Note Guarantee shall be senior to or p a r i p a s s u with such Subsidiary's Guarantee of such other Indebtedness, provided that (i) a Restricted Subsidiary's Note Guarantee may be limited in amount to the extent required by fraudulent conveyance, corporate benefit, financial assistance or other similar laws (but, in such a case (A) each of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries will use their reasonable best efforts to overcome the relevant legal limit and will procure that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary undertakes all whitewash or similar procedures which are legally available to eliminate the relevant limit and (B) the relevant Note Guarantee shall be given on an equal and ratable basis with the guarantee of any other Indebtedness giving rise to the obligation to Guarantee the Notes), (ii) for so long as it is not permissible under applicable law for a Restricted Subsidiary to become a Guarantor, such Restricted Subsidiary need not

become a Guarantor (but, in such a case, each of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries will use their reasonable best efforts to overcome the relevant legal prohibition precluding the giving of the Note Guarantee and will procure that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary undertakes all whitewash or similar procedures which are legally available to eliminate the relevant limit, and shall give such Note Guarantee at such time (and to the extent) that it thereafter becomes permissible) and (iii) no such Note Guarantee will be required as a result of any Guarantee granted in connection with the operation of cash management or cash pooling programs. Upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indentures, such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Note Guarantee created pursuant to the provisions described in the first paragraph of this covenant shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (a) (i) such Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary (including as a result of any sale, exchange or transfer (including by way of merger or consolidation), to any Person, of all of the Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary) or (ii) a sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary, in each case of sub-clauses (i) and (ii), in compliance with the covenant described under ` `R e p u r c h a s e a t th e O p tio n o f H o ld e r s -- A s s e t S a le s ' (including the requirements relating to the application of proceeds) and otherwise in compliance with the Indenture or (b) the release by the holders of the Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiary described in the preceding paragraph of their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness) (but not under the relevant guarantee)), at a time when (i) no other Indebtedness in excess of 10.0 million has been guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary; or (ii) the holders of all such other Indebtedness in excess of 10.0 million which is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary also release their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness (but not under the relevant guarantee)).
