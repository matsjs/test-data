One of the principal factors affecting our financial results and their comparability across periods is the disposal of businesses. Since January 1,2011, we have made five disposals of operational and closed mills and our recovered paper operations. As illustrated by the table and discussion under the section ``Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Results of Operations" , the comparability of our revenues and EBITDA over the periods indicated were significantly impacted by these disposals, which negatively impacted our Group's consolidated operating revenues and EBITDA.
Constant Perimeter Financial Information
Below we present our Constant Perimeter Financial Information which includes the historical operating and financial results of our existing portfolio of mills, Bruck, Golbey, Skogn, Albury, Boyer, Tasman, Walsum and Saugbrugs. The Constant Perimeter Financial Information has neither been audited nor reviewed by our independent auditors and includes information with respect to the production volumes, sales volumes, capacity, operating revenue, EBITDA and capital expenditures of the eight mills we currently operate. The Constant Perimeter Financial Information does not reflect results from our operations recorded as Other Activities in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which would require significant further adjustments and assumptions due to the difficulties in allocating revenues and costs to appropriate assets given the changes to the Group's structure. See ``Presentation of Financial and Other Information-- Constant Perimeter Financial Information" for additional details regarding the presentation of these results and their underlying assumptions. These assumptions are based on our historical unaudited management accounts and financial records, and they involve certain assumptions which were not at the time and have not since been reviewed with our auditors during the periods presented for conformity with IFRS reporting standards other than in conjunction with the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a review of our historical operating results under IFRS, please see our Consolidated Financial Statements included in these listing particulars beginning on page F-1. The Constant Perimeter Financial Information is not intended to represent or to be indicative of the consolidated results of operations our currently operational eight mills would have reported had the disposals of our Pisa, Singburi, Bio Bio, Follum, Parenco and Reparco operations occurred on January 1,2011 and has not been adjusted to reflect any additional costs or revenues that might have resulted therefrom. Some of the factors that could have caused our financial performance to differ materially from that expressed or implied by the Constant Perimeter Financial Information had such disposals occurred on January 1, 2011 include increased expenses (including the need to incur additional materials or staff-related or other costs) due to increased production at our remaining mills during the historical period with an uncertain impact on our operating margin. Use of this financial data may, therefore, give an inaccurate reflection of what our current portfolio's operational results would have been had such disposals occurred on January 1, 2011. The Constant Perimeter Financial Information is designed to aid comparability of our results across reporting periods. The purpose of such information is to illustrate the historical results of our current portfolio of operational mills as of September 30, 2014 and for the periods indicated. In particular, the table indicates the revenue decreases across our mill operations in each of the periods under review, even after having removed the negative impact of the disposals. The analysis further indicates that operating EBITDA for our current portfolio of mills decreased in each of 2011,2012 and 2013 and has increased year-over-year with respect to both the twelve months and nine months ended September 30, 2014.
