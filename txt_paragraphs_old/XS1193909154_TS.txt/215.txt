--E u ro p e . Our Newsprint segment in Europe generated gross operating earnings of NOK 309 million in 2013 compared to NOK 365 million in 2012, a decrease of 15.3%. The decline was principally due to the closure and disposal of the Follum facility and Parenco in March and August of 2012, respectively. As a percentage of segment operating revenue, gross operating earnings from our European Newsprint segment decreased from 8.1% in 2012 to 7.0% in 2013, which decrease primarily resulted from weaker pricing.
M a g a z in e P a pe r. Gross operating earnings from our Magazine Paper segment were NOK 12 million in 2013 and n Ok 349 million in 2012. The decrease principally reflected the impact of the closure of our Magazine Paper operations at our Walsum facility as well as the closure of Follum in Norway, the disposal of Parenco in the Netherlands and weak results at our Bruck facility in Austria. The results also reflected higher per unit costs for both wood and energy at our continuing magazine paper operations.
O th e r A c tiv itie s . Gross operating earnings from our Other Activities were negative NOK 56 million in 2013 and negative NOK 116 million in 2012. The improvement primarily is due to a more streamlined headquarters function following cost reduction initiatives.
Depreciation
Depreciation decreased by 22.1% to NOK 728 million in 2013 compared to NOK 935 million in 2012. The decrease was due to lower depreciation charges at our Walsum and Tasman facilities in 2013 following significant impairments recorded in 2012. As a percentage of operating revenue, depreciation decreased from 5.6% of operating revenue in 2012 to 5.5% of operating revenue in 2013.
Restructuring expenses
In 2013, restructuring expenses were NOK 145 million compared to NOK 118 million in 2012. Restructuring expenses in 2013 consisted primarily of charges related to severance payments and other

costs in connection with the closure of a paper machine at Walsum. Restructuring expenses in 2012 primarily related to the closure of a newsprint paper machine at Tasman.
