If stamp duty was triggered and not duly paid or the competent tax office was not duly notified of a dutiable transaction, the competent tax office may, within its discretion, increase the stamp duty up to 100% depending on whether the taxpayer could have recognized that the stamp duty was triggered, the

Appointment of a trustee (Kurator)
Austrian mandatory law (The Trustee Act (K u ra to rg e s e tz ; R G B 1 1 8 7 4 /4 9 , la s t a m e n d e d b y B G B 1 1 9 9 1 /1 0 ) and the Trustee Supplemental Act ( K u ra to re n e rg a n z u n g s g e s e tz ; R G B 1 1 8 7 7 /1 1 1 , la s t a m e n d e d b y B G B I 1 9 2 9 /2 2 2 )) in certain cases like court trials or insolvency proceedings initiated over an issuer's assets in Austria provide that noteholders cannot exercise their rights under the notes on their own behalf but only collectively via a trustee (K u ra to r) appointed by the competent court for all noteholders, if the noteholders rights are endangered or a third party's rights are delayed due to a lack of common representation of the noteholders. Following an appointment of such a court-appointed trustee, neither the Trustee for the Notes nor individual Noteholders will have the power to instruct the Security Agent to the extent such instructions relate to the collective rights of the Noteholders. No assurance can be given that such powers will vest in the court appointed trustee, and, even if they vest in the court appointed trustee, that the court-appointed trustee will exercise its powers in accordance with the best interests of the Noteholders.

The following is a general description of certain aspects of the prevention of corporate difficulties and insolvency proceedings governed by French law as currently in force for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Notes.

French laws and proceedings affecting creditors include debt rescheduling pursuant to Articles 1244-1 e t s e q . of the French Civil Code (C o d e c iv il), m a n d a t a d h o c proceedings (m a n d a ts a d h o c ) , conciliation proceedings (p r o c e d u r e d e c o n c ilia tio n ) , safeguard proceedings (p r o c e d u r e d e s a u v e g a rd e ), accelerated safeguard proceedings ( p ro c e d u re d e s a u v e g a rd e a c c e le re e ), accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (s a u v e g a rd e fin a n c ie re a c c e le re e ) and judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (re d re s s e m e n t or liq u id a tio n ju d ic ia ir e ) . In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and the protection of employment over the payment of creditors.
Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, if a debtor is located in the European Union (other than Denmark), French courts shall have jurisdiction over the main insolvency proceedings if the center of the debtor's main interests is situated in France. In the case of a company or legal person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be the ``center of its main interests'' in the absence of proof to the contrary. In determining whether the ``center of main interests'' of a company is in France, French courts will take into account a broad range of factual elements.
