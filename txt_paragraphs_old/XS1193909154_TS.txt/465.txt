(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Parent Guarantor or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 90 days following the closing of the Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;
(c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Parent Guarantor and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale; and
(d) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor or any Guarantor received from Persons who are not the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary that is cancelled.
Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale (except (a) when the Net Proceeds from a single transaction or series of related transactions exceeds 20.0 million in aggregate (other than an Asset Sale of the New Zealand Power Plant, the Net Proceeds of which may be applied as set forth in this paragraph) or (b) when such Net Proceeds constitute Excess Cumulative Proceeds (as defined herein)), the Parent Guarantor (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds (at the option of the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary):
(1) to purchase the Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of the Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of purchase (a ``Notes Offer'');
(2) to make a capital expenditure; or
(3) any combination of the foregoing.
Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Parent Guarantor (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.
