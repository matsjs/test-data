Taxation of interest
Both corporate and individual holders of Notes who are tax residents of Norway are subject to Norwegian tax on interest received with a flat tax rate currently at 27%. For Norwegian holders holding Notes issued with a discount (compared to the nominal value) such discount will be taxed in the year of the realization of the Notes.
Any interest received in foreign currency is converted to Norwegian kroner when calculating the taxable interest income.

In general, payments of interest on Notes issued to holders who are not tax residents of Norway are not subject to Norwegian tax. Payments to non-Norwegian holders of Notes may therefore be made without any withholding tax or deduction for any Norwegian taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges.
If the Notes are held by an individual or by a company not tax resident of Norway, that is performing business activities in Norway, and the Notes are effectively connected with such business activities in Norway, interest received will be taxed in Norway with a tax rate of 27%.
Taxation of capital gains or losses on disposal of Notes
