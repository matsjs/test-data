Security Documents
The Indenture will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent.
The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under ``--R e le a s e o f L ie n s .''
In the event that the Parent Guarantor or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See ` `R is k F a c to rs -- R is k s R e la te d to th e N o te s a n d th e G u a r a n te e s " and ``-- R is k s R e la te d to th e C o lla te r a l.' '
Enforcement of Security Interest
The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and will provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by certain hedge counterparties. These limitations are described under ` `D e s c r ip tio n o f O th e r In d e b te d n e s s -- In te r c r e d ito r A g r e e m e n t" and ``L im ita tio n s o n V a lid ity a n d E n fo r c e a b ility o f th e G u a ra n te e s a n d th e S e c u r ity I n t e r e s t s " The ability to enforce the Security Interests may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound
The Indenture will provide that the Parent Guarantor, its Restricted Subsidiaries and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the section entitled ``D e s c rip tio n o f O th e r In de bted ne ss-- In te rcre d ito r A g re e m e n t" .
