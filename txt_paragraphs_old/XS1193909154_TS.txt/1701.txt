2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued)
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions in excess of the greater of 10% of the value of plan assets or 10% of the defined benefit obligation are allocated to income over the em ployees' expected average remaining working lives.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. These contributions are m ade to publicly- or privately-administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been made. These contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the period the contribution relates to. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
b) S h are -b ase d rem un era tion
The group has a long-term incentive plan where the allocation of synthetic options to members of corporate m anagem ent is based on the development of the com pany's share price in relation to a defined group of listed paper producers. The programme results in a cash payout if the options are exercised. The fair value of the liability is measured at each balance sheet date and on the settlement date. See also Note 12.
c) B o nu s arrangem ents
The group accrues for bonus arrangements when there exists a contractual obligation, or past practice has created a constructive obligation.
