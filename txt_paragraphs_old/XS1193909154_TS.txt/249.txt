be due to downturns in our performance, the publication paper industry in Europe or Australasia or general economic conditions;  if the Proposed Exchange Offers and Proposed Consent Solicitations are not consummated, our short-term and medium-term maturity indebtedness will require us to repay U.S.$158.2 million, 129.6 million and 388.5 million in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, including maturities in 2016 and 2017; and  a reduction in sales or gross operating earnings due to our inability to successfully manage working capital and attain further operational cost savings. If our future operating cash flows and other capital resources (including availability under our factoring and securitization facilities) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:  reduce or delay our capital expenditures;  close or curtail operations at our mills and further reduce our sales and overhead staffs;  dispose of assets;  obtain additional debt or equity capital; or  refinance all or a portion of our debt. There can be no assurance that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes and our outstanding Existing Notes, limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.
