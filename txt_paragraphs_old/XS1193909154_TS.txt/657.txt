TAX CONSIDERATIONS
Certain Norwegian Tax Considerations
The following is a general presentation of certain Norwegian tax consequences resulting from the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This presentation does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the Notes. In particular, this presentation does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser subject to special tax regimes, such as banks, insurance companies or tax-exempt organizations. This summary is based on the laws currently in force and as applied on the date of these listing particulars in the Kingdom of Norway which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.
Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, including the effect of any state or local taxes under the tax laws applicable in the kingdom of Norway and each country of which they are residents or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons.
Please note that for the purpose of the summary below, a reference to a Norwegian or non-Norwegian holder of Notes refers to the tax residency and not the nationality of the holder.
