ADOPTION OF THE AMENDED IAS 19-- RESTATEMENT OF 2012 FIGURES
The most significant change in the amended IAS 19 is the removal of the corridor approach for actuarial gains and losses. Actuarial gains and losses are now recognised in the balance sheet immediately, with a charge or credit to other comprehensive income (OCI) in the periods in which they occur. These are not reclassified to profit or loss in later periods.

The net interest element is classified within Financial items. The comparable figures for 2012 in the consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet have been restated.
