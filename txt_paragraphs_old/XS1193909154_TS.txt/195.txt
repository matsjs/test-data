Total financial items amounted to a loss of NOK 498 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to a loss of NOK 935 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This decrease in losses was primarily due to the effects of the strengthening of the n Ok against the Euro and the U.S. dollar on the value of our debt denominated in such currencies.
Income taxes
We recognized tax expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 of NOK 105 million, compared to tax income of NOK 360 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The change in income tax was primarily due to reduced loss before income taxes, reduced deferred tax assets in Norway and re-assessment of tax positions in the Group during the nine months ended September 30, 2014.
