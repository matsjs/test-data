· if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Temporary Notes Issuer or the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depository for the Global Notes and a successor depository is not appointed by the Temporary Notes Issuer or the Issuer within 120 days;
· if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the Temporary Notes Indenture or the Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Temporary Notes Indenture or the Indenture.
In such an event, the Temporary Notes Issuer or the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based
281
upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in `` T ra n s fe r R e s tric tio n s " unless that legend is not required by the Temporary Notes Indenture or the Indenture or applicable law.
Redemption of Global Notes
In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will distribute the amount received by them or it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by them or it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Temporary Notes Issuer and the Issuer understand that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants' accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; p ro v id e d , h o w e v e r, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than 100,000 principal amount at maturity may be redeemed in part.
Payments on Global Notes
Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest, additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Temporary Notes Issuer or the Issuer to the Paying Agent. In turn, the Paying Agent will make such payments to the common depository or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under ``D e s c r ip tio n o f th e S e n io r S e c u r e d N o te s -- A d d itio n a l A m o u n ts .'' If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under ``D e s c r ip tio n o f th e S e n io r S e c u r e d N o te s -- A d d itio n a l A m o u n ts ,' ' we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.
