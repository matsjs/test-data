(1) acquisitions that have been made by the specified Person or any of its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, including through mergers or consolidations, or any Person or any of its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries acquired by the specified Person or any of its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, and including all related financing transactions and including increases in ownership of Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to the Calculation Date, or that are to be made on the Calculation Date, will be given p r o fo rm a effect (as determined in good faith and certified by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Parent Guarantor and may include anticipated expense and cost reduction synergies in connection with any acquisition) as if they had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period;
