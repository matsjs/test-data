8. FINANCIAL RISK AND HEDGE ACCO UNTING (Continued)
Norske Skog's net investment hedging is carried out in accordance with IAS 39. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity and offset by translation differences from assets in subsidiaries. The gain or loss related to the ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the income statement. There was no ineffectiveness related to net investment hedge in 2012 or 2011. The effective portion recognised in equity was a gain of NOK 2 million in 2012 (gain of NOK 19 million in 2011). The portion of the debt portfolio to which hedge accounting does not apply was somewhat smaller in 2012 than in 2011. Hedge accounting of USD loans was stopped in the first quarter of 2012 due to the divestment of Papeles Norske Skog Bio Bio S.A. in Chile and change of functional currency from USD to BRL for Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. in Brazil. Foreign exchange gains and losses from such liabilities are recognised in the income statement under Financial items. Cumulative currency translation differences of NOK - 30 million were reclassified to the income statement in 2012 as a result of the divestments of Papeles Norske Skog Bio Bio S.A. in Chile, Norske Skog Parenco B.V, in the Netherlands and the global recovered paper business, Reparco. During 2011, cumulative currency translation differences of NOK 12 million were reclassified to the income statement as a result of the divestment of the sales office Norske Skog (USA) Inc.
