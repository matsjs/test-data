For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a loss from other gains and losses of NOK 1,100 million, compared to a loss of NOK 1,009 million in 2012. In 2013, 73.2% of our losses from other gains and losses stemmed from losses incurred due to changes in the value of commodity contracts (NOK 402 million) and embedded derivatives (NOK 403 million). The losses on commodities contracts were primarily due to lower than expected future energy prices and currency effects. These currency effects also accounted for the losses on embedded derivatives contracts. The losses in 2013 were primarily related to the appreciation of the Euro relative to the Norwegian kroner.
