Australasia. Operating revenue from our Australasian segment decreased by 26.1% to NOK 2,229 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to NOK 3,014 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The decline reflects the impact of the divestments of Pisa in Brazil (June 2013) and Singburi in Thailand (November 2013) and lost production capacity from our Boyer mill during the conversion of one of its two paper machines to magazine paper operations during the first quarter of 2014. Demand for Australasian publication paper fell 4.1% during the nine months ended September 30, 2014, which reflected a decline in demand for Australasian newsprint of 6.1% and a decline in demand for Australasian magazine paper of 2.4%. Prices for Australasian newsprint remained relatively flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013 due to our long-term contracts with our two largest customers in that market.
Other Activities. Operating revenue from Other Activities decreased to NOK 101 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, from NOK 272 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The decrease in operating revenue was primarily due to lower intercompany sales of energy and wood, which reflected our decision to transfer responsibility for the sourcing of energy and wood from our corporate group to the mills themselves.
