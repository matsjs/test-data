The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. Unsecured Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be subordinate or junior to secured Indebtedness by virtue of its nature as unsecured Indebtedness.
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, ``incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; p r o v id e d , h o w e v e r , that the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock and the Restricted Subsidiaries may issue preferred stock, if on the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or such preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, (1) the Parent Guarantor's Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent Guarantor's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or such preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a p r o fo rm a basis (including a p r o fo rm a application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period; and (2) to the extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, the Parent Guarantor's Consolidated Senior Leverage Ratio for the Parent Guarantor's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred would have been less than 2.75 to 1.0, on a p r o fo rm a basis (including a p r o fo rm a application of the net proceeds therefrom). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Restricted Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor that are not Guarantors may not incur Indebtedness pursuant to this paragraph if, after giving p r o fo rm a effect to such incurrence or issuance (including p r o fo rm a application of the net proceeds therefrom), the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors incurred or issued pursuant to this paragraph would exceed 25.0 million.
The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, ``Permitted Debt''):
(1) the incurrence by the Issuer and any Guarantor of additional Indebtedness under Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) not to exceed 10.0 million, p lu s in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;
(2) Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue Date (including the HoldCo Exchange Notes and the HoldCo Exchange Note Guarantees (p ro v id e d that the HoldCo Exchange Note Guarantee of each Subsidiary Guarantor shall be expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations under the Note Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor), but excluding any Indebtedness repaid with the proceeds of the Notes);
(3) the incurrence by the Issuer of Indebtedness represented by the Notes issued on the Issue Date and by the Guarantors of the Note Guarantees;
181
(4) the Guarantee (a) by the Second Intermediate Parent Guarantor of the Existing 2016 Notes and (b) the Guarantee by any Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor of Indebtedness of the Second Intermediate Parent Guarantor on a basis that is subordinated to or p a r i p a s s u with such Guarantor's Guarantee of the HoldCo Exchange Notes;
(5) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary and Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness or preferred stock of any Restricted Subsidiary in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge, any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and preferred stock (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was permitted by the Indenture to be incurred by the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, under the first paragraph of this covenant or clauses (2), (3), (5) or (14) of this paragraph;
