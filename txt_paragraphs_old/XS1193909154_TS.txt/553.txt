Subordination of the Subsidiary Guarantors' Exchange Note Guarantees
Each of the Subsidiary Guarantor's Exchange Note Guarantees is a senior subordinated Guarantee, which means that, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, each such Exchange Note Guarantee ranks behind, and is expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor, the holders of which (or their representatives) are party to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including any obligations owed by the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes. The ability to take enforcement action against the Subsidiary Guarantors under their Exchange Note Guarantees is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of the Exchange Note Guarantees, and may be subject to significant restrictions in any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date. For a description of the restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, see ` `D e s c r ip tio n o f O th e r In d e b te d n e s s -- In te r c r e d ito r A g r e e m e n t.' '
Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors of a Subsidiary Guarantor would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Exchange Notes recover in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such Subsidiary Guarantor. In any case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Exchange Notes.
Further, the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor under its Exchange Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Exchange Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law or capital maintenance regulations.
