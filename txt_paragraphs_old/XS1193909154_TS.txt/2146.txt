NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
8. FINANCIAL RISK AND HEDGE ACCO UNTING (Continued)
debt instruments, all combined currency and interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts are also used for hedging net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Norske Skog's net investment hedging is carried out in accordance with IAS 39. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity and offset by translation differences from assets in subsidiaries. The gain or loss related to the ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the income statement. There was no ineffectiveness related to net investment hedge in 2011 and 2010. The effective portion recognised in equity was a gain of NOK 19 million in 2011 (gain of NOK 162 million in 2010). The portion of the debt portfolio to which hedge accounting does not apply, was somewhat smaller in 2011 than in 2010. The foreign exchange gains and losses from such liabilities are recognised in the income statement under Financial items. During 2011, cumulative currency translation differences of NOK 12 million were reclassified to the income statement as a result of the sale of the sales office Norske Skog (USA) Inc.
