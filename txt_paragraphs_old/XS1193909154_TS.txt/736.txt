debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor of debt into a debt-to-equity swap if it does not consent to such debt-to-equity swap.
If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted (but not yet illiquid) it may also file for insolvency in the form of a protection scheme (S c h u tz s c h irm v e rfa h re n ). In such a case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for a period of up to three months. During such period, the debtor shall, together with its creditors and a preliminary trustee (v o rlo u fig e r S a c h w a lte r), prepare an insolvency plan which ideally will be implemented in formal self-administration proceedings (E ig e n v e rw a ltu n g ) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.
Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which means there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity has, from an insolvency laws point of view, to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-a-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. In 2013, the German Federal Ministry of Justice (B u n d e s ju s tiz m in is te riu m ) has released a draft Bill to Facilitate the Handling of Group Insolvencies (E n tw u rf e in e s G e s e tz e s z u r E r le ic h te r u n g d e r B e w o ltig u n g v o n K o n z e rn in s o lv e n z e n ). While the draft Bill does not propose to abolish the principle of separate insolvency proceedings in relation to each group entity, it stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Act in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (1) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceedings; (2) the appointment of an identical person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (3) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors' committees; and (4) certain parties may apply for ``coordination proceedings'' (K o o rd in a tio n s v e rfa h re n ) and the appointment of a ``coordination insolvency administrator'' (K o o rd in a tio n s v e rw a lte r) with the ability to propose a ``coordination plan'' (K o o rd in a tio n s p la n ). It is currently unclear if and when, and whether in its current or modified form, this Bill might be adopted by parliament.
Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors.
Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.
Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or ``escape clauses'' entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (in s o lv e n z b e z o g e n e K o n d ig u n g s re c h te o d e r L o s u n g s k la u s e ln ) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.
Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the relevant creditor being considered to hold a ``shareholder-like position'' (g e s e lls c h a fte ro h n lic h e S te llu n g ) in the relevant debtor company. In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of such debtor, the claims against such debtor would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (n a c h ra n g ig e In s o lv e n z fo rd e ru n g e n ), meaning that dividends on such claim would only be made if all non-subordinated creditors' claims have been fully satisfied. Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the debtor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the majority of insolvency cases governed by German law as in most
338
cases, the insolvency estate will not be sufficient to make any dividends on subordinated insolvency claims.
