We present in these listing particulars certain financial information that our management has prepared on a ``constant perimeter'' basis, which includes only the historical operating results of our eight currently operational mills, Bruck, Golbey, Skogn, Albury, Boyer, Tasman, Walsum and Saugbrugs (the ``Constant Perimeter Financial Information'') that has neither been audited nor reviewed by our independent auditors. See ``Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Factors Affecting Comparability-Significant disposals or reductions in capacity" .
See ``Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-- The Constant Perimeter Financial Information included in these listing particulars has been compiled from non-IFRS financial data based on certain assumptions, adjustments and estimates made by our management and is unaudited and unreviewed by our auditors.''
The Constant Perimeter Financial Information was prepared on the following basis:
· the results of the disposed businesses have been excluded for all periods prior to their disposition;
· the results of our current portfolio of mills are based on unaudited and unreviewed management accounts for the relevant period and no adjustments have been made for the discontinuance of certain operations at our Walsum and Tasman mills in 2013 (see ``Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Factors Affecting Comparability-- Significant disposals or reductions in capacity"); and
· the results of the continuing operations have not been adjusted to reflect any increases or decreases of revenue or increases or decreases in costs that may have been incurred had the disposals identified in ``Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Factors Affecting Comparability--Significant disposals or reductions in capacity" actually taken place on January 1, 2011.
Production Capacity
We estimate production capacity using the production capacity of our mills as a demonstrated maximum production output (in tons per year) which we derive by annualizing (based on 362 days) the average saleable paper production output (in tons per hour) from the three calendar months with the highest production volumes over the last twelve-month period that have a capacity utilization rate of greater than 90%. Our estimates of production capacity are unaudited and involve significant estimates and assumptions made by our management.
We use an average saleable production (in tons per hour) of the three calendar months with the highest production volumes in a twelve-month period as we believe it represents an accurate approximation of the maximum capabilities of the equipment and processes, and a repeatable high-performance production rate, given the same conditions. We use months in which we achieve a capacity utilization rate of greater than 90% because we believe these represent periods when minimum external factors,
