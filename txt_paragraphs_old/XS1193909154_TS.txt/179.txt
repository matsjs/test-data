Operating revenue
Operating revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased by 8.8% to NOK 8,942 million compared to NOK 9,805 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Sales volumes (as measured by deliveries) in Europe in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were 8.4% lower than sales volumes in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Sales volumes in Australasia in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were 30.9% lower than Australasian sales volumes in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. These reductions in our sales volumes were the principal factor for the decline in our operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.
The following table sets forth our production volumes and sales volumes by operating segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014.
