Emissions are recognised in the income statement as Cost of materials, and the government grant (deferred revenue) is recognised concurrently with emission costs. Unused credits (deferred income) and used allowances are netted against the carrying amount of intangible asset recognised in the balance sheet, when the individual contracts for emission allowances fall due for settlement.
If the number of allowances received exceeds actual consumption, the surplus is sold in the market. The gain/loss from the sale is presented as Other gains and losses. Emission rights sold in advance are recognised as income in line with actual consumption.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the com pany's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the group financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved in the general meeting.
Important accounting estim ates and assum ptions
The group prepares estimates and makes assumptions for the future. Accounting estimates derived from these will, by definition, seldom accord fully with the final outcome. Estimates and assumptions which represent a substantial risk for significant changes in the capitalised value of assets and liabilities during the coming fiscal year are discussed below.

The group performs periodic tests to assess whether there has been a decline in the value of intangible assets and PPE. These are written down to their recoverable amount when the recoverable amount is lower than the assets carrying value. The recoverable amount from assets or cash-generating units is determined by calculating the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit. Calculation of value in use requires use of estimates.
