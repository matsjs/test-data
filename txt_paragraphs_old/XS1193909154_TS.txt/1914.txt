The revised standard IAS 19 E m p lo y e e b e n e fits is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, and the am endm ent is to be applied retrospectively. Under the revised standard, the corridor approach is removed, and all re-measurement impacts (actuarial gains and losses) are to be recognised in Other Comprehensive Income, without any subsequent recirculation through the income statement. The change implies that the real net pension obligation (asset) is reflected in the balance sheet. The impact of implementing the am ended IAS 19 is shown in the table below.
