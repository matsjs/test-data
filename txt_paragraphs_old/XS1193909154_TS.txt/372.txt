The 2033 Notes provide that we may, at our option, redeem the 2033 Notes prior to their scheduled maturity date at an amount equal to the greater of (i) the principal amount then outstanding, plus accrued but unpaid interest and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the relevant notes discounted, on a semi-annual basis, at a rate equal to the applicable U.S. treasury rate, plus 40 basis points, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Additionally, we may also redeem the 2033 Notes for certain tax reasons at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The notes may be purchased by us or by any of our affiliates in the open market.
Purchase or Exchange of Existing Bonds
From time to time, we enter into transactions for the repurchase of our existing bonds, either in open market transactions or otherwise. When we buy back bonds, we may either cancel such bonds or hold them. Upon the cancellation of such bonds, the aggregate principal amount outstanding in respect of such bond issuances is reduced. If we continue to hold such bonds, this is deducted from the value of our interest-bearing liabilities on our balance sheet. At December 31,2013, we held NOK 170 million of Norwegian bonds (compared to NOK 163 million at December 31, 2012 and NOK 361 million at December 31, 2011). As of December 31, 2013, we held U.S.$42 million and 132 million of foreign currency bonds (compared to U.S.$42 million and 132 million as of December 31, 2012 and U.S.$29 million and 63 million as of December 31, 2011).
Any gain or loss associated with the buy-back of bonds is recognized on our income statement as a gain or loss in the same period the buy-back occurs. For the year ended December 31,2013, we did not conduct any bond buy backs and did not recognize any gain or loss on the buy-back of our bonds, compared with a gain of NOK 187 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and a gain of NOK 203 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Other Arrangements
Enova Grant
Norske Skog Saugbrugs AS was awarded a grant from the Norwegain National Energy Agency (``Enova'') on June 14, 2012. The grant covered 22.7% of the approved and incurred project costs related to the development of the Saugbrugs TMP operations. The grant is limited to a maximum amount of NOK 50 million. As of November 25, 2014, NOK 30 million had been disbursed to Norske Skog Saugbrugs AS. Total disbursements are estimated to amount to between NOK 45 million and NOK 46 million, as the total project costs will be lower than originally estimated (originally NOK 220 million).
The development of the TMP operations commenced on October 1,2012 and are scheduled to be fully completed on December 1,2014. The grant is conditional upon the TMP operations contributing to the production of 70,200,000 kWh per year in domestic environment-friendly energy production and/or savings. Measurements to determine compliance will begin effective January 1,2015. In the event that the project at completion fails to provide the anticipated energy savings set out in the grant letter, Enova can withdraw a corresponding amount of the grant and potentially request repayment of certain monies
