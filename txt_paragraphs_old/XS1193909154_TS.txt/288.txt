The continuous trend of capacity reductions has helped drive higher utilization rates (calculated as production divided by capacity) throughout the industry and has supported profitability and pricing levels. Utilization rates are generally seen as a good indication of the existing balance between demand and supply. High utilization rates imply that there is a relatively small amount of overcapacity in the market, which in turn implies a more favorable pricing environment for the producers.
