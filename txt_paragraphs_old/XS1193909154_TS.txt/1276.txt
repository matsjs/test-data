Intangible assets which have an indefinite useful life and goodwill are not subject to amortisation, but are tested annually for impairment. Property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from a cash-generating unit. Norske Skog applies a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) model for calculating the present value of future cash flows. Calculation of value in use requires use of estimates.

Fair values of commodity contracts and embedded derivatives in commodity contracts which are not traded in an active marked, are assessed through valuation techniques. Norske Skog has one long-term energy contract in New Zealand. The electricity prices for long-term electricity contracts in New Zealand are not directly observable in the market for the whole contract length. Price forecasts from acknowledged external sources are used in the estimation of fair value. The group uses its judgement to select a variety
