Our operating revenue consists almost exclusively of the sale of goods, and the recognition of revenue is the same for newsprint and magazine paper. Operating revenue is typically recognized at a point in time between finalization of production of our products and delivery of the products to our customer, depending on the buyer's delivery terms.
Operating expenses are comprised of distribution costs, cost of raw materials, changes in inventories, employee benefit expenses and other operating expenses.
D is trib u tio n c o s ts . Distribution costs represent the cost of transporting our finished products to our customers.
C o s t o f m a te ria ls . Cost of materials includes the raw materials used to make our products, which includes the price of various energy sources used by our mills, wood, recovered paper and pulp, together with distribution costs related to delivering the raw materials to our mills.
C h a n g e s in in v e n to rie s . Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value and the change in inventories from a prior period is recognized as a change in inventories. Gains or losses on the sale of our inventories are recognized on a first-in-first-out basis.
E m p lo y e e b e n e fit e x p e n s e s . Employee benefit expenses include salaries, bonuses and the cost of other employee benefits such as payments to defined benefit and defined contribution plans.

G ro s s o p e ra tin g e a rn in g s . In the income statement of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we present gross operating earnings for the Group, and in our segment reporting, we assess the performance of our operating segments based on a measure of gross operating earnings. Gross operating earnings excludes the effects of expenditure not deemed to be part of regular operating activities. Gross operating earnings represents operating earnings before depreciation, restructuring expenses, other gains and losses (such as gains and losses from sales of non-current assets and changes in the fair value of certain energy contracts and biological assets) and impairments. In these listing particulars, EBITDA is defined on the same basis as gross operating earnings. For a reconciliation of EBITDA to profit/loss, see ``S u m m a ry C o n s o lid a te d F in a n c ia l a n d O th e r D a ta " and ``P r e s e n ta tio n o f F in a n cia l a n d O th e r In fo rm a tio n --N on-IFR S a n d O th e r F in a n cia l M e a s u re s ."
