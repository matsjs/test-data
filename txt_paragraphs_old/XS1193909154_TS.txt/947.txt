Interest income
Leases
Leases in which the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Leases relating to property and equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are recognised in the balance sheet to the lower of the fair value of the lease property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charge and reduction of the outstanding liability, giving a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The leased property is depreciated according to the same principles applied for other non-current assets. The corresponding rental obligation, net of finance charges, is included in other long-term payables. If the leasing period is shorter than the useful life of the asset and it is unlikely that the group will purchase the asset at the end of the leasing period, the asset is depreciated over the leasing period.
Government grants
Government grants (except for emission rights, described below) are recognised as income over the period necessary to match the grants on a systematic basis to the costs that they are intended to compensate for. Government grants in the form of compensation for losses which have already been incurred, or in the form of direct financial support which is not directly related to future costs, are recognised as income in the same period as they are awarded.
Government grants related to assets are presented in the balance sheet as deferred income or as a reduction of the cost price of the assets the grant relates to. The grant is then recognised in the income
