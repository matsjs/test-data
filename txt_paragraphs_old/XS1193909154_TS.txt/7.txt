NOTICE TO INVESTORS IN SWITZERLAND
These listing particulars do not constitute a public offering prospectus as that term is understood pursuant to Article 652a of the Swiss Code of Obligations. We have not applied for a listing of the Notes on the SWX Swiss Exchange and consequently the information presented in these listing particulars does not necessarily comply with the information standards set out in the relevant listing rules. The Notes may not be publicly offered or sold in Switzerland. The Notes may be offered or sold only to a selected number of individual investors in Switzerland, under circumstances which will not result in the Notes being a public offering within the meaning of Article 652a of the Swiss Code of Obligations. Each copy of these listing particulars is addressed to a specifically named recipient and shall not be passed to a third party.
NOTICE TO INVESTORS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA
These listing particulars have been prepared on the basis that all offers of Notes will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive, as amended, as implemented in member states of the European Economic Area (the ``EEA''), from the requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes which are subject of the Offering must only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in these listing particulars. The expression ``Prospectus Directive'' means Directive 2003/71/ eC of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 4, 2003 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading and amending Directive 2001/34/EC and the amendments thereto (including the 2010 PD Amending Directive, in the case of Early Implementing Member States (as defined below)), and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Relevant Member State (as defined below). The expression ``2010 PD Amending Directive'' means Directive 2010/73/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 24, 2010 amending Directives 2003/71/ e C on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading and 2004/109/EC on the harmonization of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market.
In relation to each member state of the EEA which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a ``Relevant Member State''), including each Relevant Member State that has implemented the 2010 PD Amending Directive (each an ``Early Implementing Member State''), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the ``Relevant Implementation Date''), no offer has been made and no offer will be made of the Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State prior to the publication of a prospectus in relation to the Notes that has been approved by the competent authority in that Relevant Member State or, where appropriate, approved in another Relevant Member State and notified to the competent authority in that Relevant Member State, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive, except that, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, the Notes may be offered in that Relevant Member State at any time to:
(a) ``qualified investors'' as defined in the Prospectus Directive, including:
