Total financial items amounted to a loss of NOK 1,258 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to a loss of NOK 117 million for the year ended December 31,2012. The increase in loss is primarily due to the effects of the depreciation of the Norwegian kroner against other major currencies in 2013 on the value of debt denominated in such non-NOK currencies. Other financial income in 2012 reflects the gain on purchases of our debt securities in 2012.
