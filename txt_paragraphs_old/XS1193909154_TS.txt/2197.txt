Total debt listed in the repayment schedule may differ from booked debt. This is due to premiums or discounts on issued bonds, hedge reserves and fair value hedging. At 31 Decem ber 2011, the accounts included a discount of NOK 91 million (discount of 51 million at 31 Decem ber 2010). Premiums or discounts on issued bonds are amortised in the income statement over the lifetime of the issued bonds. See Note 6 for loans secured by mortgage.
As a result of the termination of a large part of the fair value hedge portfolio in the beginning of 2009, an amount was reclassified in the balance sheet. A hedge reserve (deferred income) amounting to NOK 270 million is included in interest-bearing debt as at 31 Decem ber 2011 (NOK 338 million at 31 Decem ber 2010). The hedge reserve does not constitute any payment obligation for the group, but will be amortised in the income statement over the term of the debt that has been hedged.
Total interest-bearing debt is affected by unrealised currency effects on forward contracts and on cross currency swap contracts. This will also differ from booked debt. At 31 Decem ber 2011, this effect decreased debt by NOK 84 million (increased debt by NOK 236 million at 31 Decem ber 2010).
