12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSES (Continued)

Long-term incentive program me
The board of directors adopted new principles for the long-term incentive programme in 2007, whereby the criteria for awarding synthetic shares to corporate managem ent is related to Total Shareholder Return (TSR-- development of the share price including dividend payments), such that this must be above average for a defined group of paper manufacturers, including Norske Skog. A positive TSR for the period is also an absolute condition. This scheme will yield a 30% payout if Norske Skog performs better than the average for the reference group and a full payout if the com pany falls within the best quartile. Progress is measured over a three-year period, with a new period beginning each year. This scheme involves no dilution effect.
The programme was continued for 2010 with some changes: the maximum annual bonus from the programme was set to NOK 4 million for the CEO and NOK 2 million for other members of corporate managem ent (instead of a fixed number of shares), and the bonus after tax must be used to purchase shares until the total shareholding in the com pany corresponds to a certain number of shares (200 000 for the CEO and 100 000 for other members of corporate management). The programme was continued for 2012. There will be no programme for 2013.
