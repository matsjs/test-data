(1) Transfers out of level 3 in 2013 related to energy contracts in the companies Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. and Nordica Energia Ltda. in Brazil, which were sold in 2013.
The fair value of derivatives that are not traded in an active market (over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using various valuation techniques. Interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forward rate agreements and foreign currency forward contracts are all valued by estimating the present value of future cash flows. Currency options are valued using recognised option pricing models. Quoted cash and swap rates are used as input for calculating zero coupon curves used for discounting. The exchange rates used are the quoted closing rates at 31 December.
The fair value of commodity contracts recognised in the balance sheet is calculated by using quotes from actively traded markets when available. Otherwise, price forecasts from acknowledged external sources are used. Commodity contracts that fail to meet the own-use exemption criteria in IAS 39 are recognised in the balance sheet and valued on the same principle as financial contracts. Some of these are long-term energy contracts. In calculating the fair value of embedded derivatives, valuation techniques are used in the absence of observable market inputs. Embedded currency options are calculated using a Black 76 valuation model, where some input assumptions have been made in absence of an active long-term option market.
The following table is presented in accordance with IFRS 7.27, showing the fair value of commodity contracts in level 3 given a change in assumptions to a reasonably possible alternative.
