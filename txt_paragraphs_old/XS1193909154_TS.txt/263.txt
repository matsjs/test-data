Derivatives
Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to various financial risks through our operating activities, including market risk (interest rate risk, currency risk and commodity price risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. We seek to minimize losses and volatility on our earnings caused by adverse market movements. We monitor and manage financial risk based on internal policies and standards set forth by corporate management and approved by the Board of Directors. These written policies provide principles for the overall risk management, as well as standards for managing exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments. Compliance with policies and standards is continuously monitored.
Interest rate risk
There has historically been a correlation between economic trends and interest rate movements, with interest rates falling during an economic downturn and rising in an economic recovery. We seek to structure our debt portfolio such that interest costs partly offset changes in revenue as a consequence of changes in the economic climate. The goal of interest rate risk management is to secure the lowest possible interest rate payments over time within acceptable risk limits. In the current challenging

situation in the publication paper market, we have secured most of the interest rate payments by primarily paying fixed interest rates on our debt obligations.
The following table sets forth, by interest rate type, our interest-bearing assets and liabilities with corresponding hedges, for the periods indicated:
