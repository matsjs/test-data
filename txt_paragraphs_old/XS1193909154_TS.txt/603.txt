No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Exchange Notes Issuer or any of their shareholders or Affiliates, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Exchange Notes Issuer or the Guarantors under the Exchange Notes, the Exchange Notes Indenture, the Exchange Note Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of Exchange Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Exchange Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under applicable securities laws.
The Exchange Notes Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officer's Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Exchange Notes and all obligations of any Guarantors discharged with respect to their Exchange Note Guarantees (``Legal Defeasance'') except for:
(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Exchange Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts) or premium, if any, on, such Exchange Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;
(2) the Exchange Notes Issuer's obligations with respect to the Exchange Notes concerning issuing temporary Exchange Notes, registration of Exchange Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Exchange Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all Events of Default described under ` `-- E v e n ts o f D e fa u lt a n d R e m e d ie s " (except those relating to payments on the Exchange Notes or, solely with respect to the Exchange Notes Issuer, bankruptcy or insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Exchange Notes.
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:
(1) the Exchange Notes Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Exchange Notes, cash in euros, non-callable Euro Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euros and non-callable Euro Government Obligations (in the case of the Euro-denominated Exchange Notes) and cash in US dollars, non-callable US Government Obligations or a combination of cash in u S dollars and non-callable US Government Obligations (in the case of the US dollar-denominated Exchange Notes), in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
