In addition, if the French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the Guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm's-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm'slength transaction could be taxable or non tax deductible under certain circumstances.
 existence of a genuine group of companies to which the guarantor and the person whose obligations are being guaranteed belong operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective and the guarantee or security documents, and the transaction to which they relate, must be entered into in furtherance of the common economic interest of the group as a whole and the liability under the guarantee should be commensurate with such group benefit;
 the risk assumed by the guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit;
 the guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee or security interest which is commensurate with the liability which it takes on under the guarantee or security interest; and
 the obligations of the guarantor under the guarantee or security interest must not exceed its financial capability.
The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the French Guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.
Limitation on enforcement of Security Interests
Security Interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations and may only be enforced following a payment default (including following acceleration) and may only secure obligations up to the secured amount that is due and remaining unpaid. Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) pursuant to a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (y) by way of the judicial foreclosure (a ttrib u tio n ju d ic ia ire ) of the pledged assets or (ii) by way of contractual foreclosure (a ttrib u tio n c o n v e n tio n n e lle or p a c te c o m m is s o ire ) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets.
If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or private foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed
