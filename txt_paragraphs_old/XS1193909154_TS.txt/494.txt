Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parent Guarantor will, and will procure that each of its Restricted Subsidiaries will, execute all transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of such assets, whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees; and give all notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may, in each case, reasonably request.
