2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The interim financial statements of Norske Skog have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 In te rim F in a n c ia l R e p o rtin g . The interim financial statements do not include all information required for full annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for 2014. The interim financial statements are unaudited.
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the interim financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014, except for the adaptation of amended standards and new interpretations, which are mandatory from 1 January 2015. These changes are described in the annual financial statements for 2014.
The group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet mandatory.
From the first quarter of 2015, Norske Skog has changed its accounting practice for embedded derivatives in energy contracts in Norway. The new accounting policy is assessed to result in financial reporting that is more aligned to the rationale for requiring separation of embedded derivatives and will accordingly result in more relevant and less volatile information being presented to the users of the financial statements. In accordance with IAS 8 A c c o u n tin g P o lic ie s , C h a n g e s in A c c o u n tin g E s tim a te s , 2014 figures in the condensed consolidated income statement, condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed consolidated balance sheet and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows have been restated. The implementation effects of the amended practices are further described in Note 7.
