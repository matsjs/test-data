The PPS Act includes general default priority rules as well as specific rules in relation to certain types of Security Interests. Under those rules:
 priority as between perfected interests is determined by the time of perfection (subject to other specific rules including those listed below) and priority as between unperfected interests is determined by the time of attachment;
 subject to some exceptions, certain Security Interests which are purchase money security interests (each, a ``PMSI'') will take priority over Security Interests which are not PMSIs if the PMSI is registered within the timeframes specified in the PPS Act by a registration that indicates that it is a PMSI. A PMSI is a security interest in collateral that secures all or part of its purchase price (for example, a hire purchase agreement or retention of title arrangement) or a security interest where the secured party has provided value to enable the grantor to acquire the collateral. It also includes the interest of a lessor or bailor of goods under a PPS lease and the interest of a consignor under a commercial consignment;
 a security interest perfected by control will take priority over a Security Interest perfected by possession or registration (regardless of the time of creation or perfection of those other interests); and
 the priority afforded to a security interest will apply to all advances secured by that interest and secured parties may enter into agreements with each other to regulate the priority of their Security Interests which will override the position which would otherwise apply under the PPS Act.

Under the PPS Act, security held by an authorised deposit taking institution or ``ADI'' (which is a corporation authorised under the Banking Act 1959 of Australia and would cover most banks) over an account held with that institution is automatically perfected by control. This means that creditors with security over ADI accounts need to consider entering into contractual arrangements with the account bank in order to obtain priority for their interests. Other interests may take priority over PPS Act Security Interests, such as recipients of certain payments and acquirers of certain instruments and execution creditors, while certain claims are preferred on insolvency, such as those discussed above in relation to circulating Security Interests and floating charges.
Taking free rules under the PPS Act
There are also a number of circumstances in which a third party (such as a purchaser or lessee of collateral) can take the collateral free of a perfected security interest. These include (subject to exceptions) where the sale or lease is in the ordinary course of the grantor's business (unless the buyer or lessee actually knew it would breach the security agreement) and where a purchaser of shares or other investment instruments buys those instruments in the ordinary course of trading on a prescribed financial market.
