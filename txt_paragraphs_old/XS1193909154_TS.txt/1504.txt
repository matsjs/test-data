· Other currency derivatives that are recognised at fair value through profit and loss will affect the income statement. These effects come mainly from currency derivatives designated as hedging of the group's 12-month rolling cash flow exposure, and financial liabilities managed as economic net investment hedges which do not qualify for hedge accounting according to IAS 39.
· Correlation effects between currencies are not taken into account. Figures are presented net of tax.
At 31 December 2013, if NOK had appreciated 10% against all currencies to which the group has significant exposure, net profit after tax from financial instruments would have been NOK 265 million higher (NOK 292 million higher at 31 December 2012). If NOK had depreciated by 10% at 31 December 2013 against all currencies to which the group has significant exposure, net profit after tax from financial instruments would have been NOK 285 million lower (NOK 292 million lower at 31 December 2012). Net profit after tax is affected in a non-linear manner due to changes in the fair value of options. The effect of the sensitivity analysis on the income statement is mainly caused by changes in fair value of derivatives designated as rolling cash flow hedge, and foreign exchange gains/losses on the translation of EUR and USD denominated debt for which there is no hedge accounting. Due to the fact that the portion of debt has decreased in relation to the portion of cash, the effect on the income statement is lower in 2013 compared to 2012.
Given a 10% appreciation/depreciation of NOK, equity would have been NOK 189 million higher/lower (NOK 180 million higher/lower at 31 December 2012) as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on
