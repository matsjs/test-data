See ``-- F a c to r s A ffe c tin g C o m p a r a b ilit y - S ig n if ic a n t d is p o s a ls o r r e d u c tio n s in c a p a c it y " . The net effect of these actions has been to reduce our production capacity by 32% from 4.3 million tons of annual production capacity as of December 31, 2010 to 3.0 million tons of annual production capacity as of September 30, 2014. In reducing our capacity, we have retained our operations in Europe and Australasia, which we believe benefit from significant intra-regional synergies, while divesting our operations in Asia and Latin America where we lacked such synergies.
In addition to capacity reduction, and in order to improve our operating margins, we have also made various investments in cost reduction initiatives and higher margin production lines at certain of our continuing operating facilities. See ``--L iq u id ity a n d C a p ita l R e s o u r c e s -- C a p ita l e x p e n d itu r e s " . Our renewed focus on optimizing our working capital has increased our ability to make such investments. Our working capital requirements have declined faster than other Group requirements since 2011. We have reduced our working capital requirements primarily through reductions in inventories and an improved control of accounts receivable.
