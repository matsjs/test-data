Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in euros, in the case of the euro-denominated Exchange Notes, and US dollars in the case of the US dollar- denominated Exchange Notes, which is made to or for the account of any holder or the Trustee in lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the ``Judgment Currency''), whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the liquidation of the Exchange Notes Issuer or any Guarantor, shall constitute a discharge of the Exchange Notes Issuer or the Guarantor's obligation under the Exchange Notes Indenture and the Exchange Notes or Exchange Note Guarantee, as the case may be, only to the extent of the amount of euros or US dollars, as the case may be, with such holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, could purchase in the London foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Judgment Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first Business Day following receipt of the payment in the Judgment Currency. If the amount of euros or US dollars, as the case may be, that could be so purchased is less than the amount of euros originally due to such holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, the Exchange Notes Issuer and the Guarantors shall indemnify and hold harmless the
holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, from and against all loss or damage arising out of, or as a result of, such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in the Exchange Notes Indenture or the Exchange Notes, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any holder or the Trustee from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.
Concerning the Trustee
The Exchange Notes Issuer shall deliver written notice to the Trustee within 30 days of becoming aware of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in transactions with the Exchange Notes Issuer and any Guarantor; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee.
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Exchange Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Exchange Notes Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Exchange Notes Indenture at the request of any holder of Exchange Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.
The Exchange Notes Issuer and the Guarantors jointly and severally will indemnify the Trustee for certain claims, liabilities and expenses incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with its duties.
