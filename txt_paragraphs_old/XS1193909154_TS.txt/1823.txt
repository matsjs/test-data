8. FINANCIAL RISK AND HEDGE ACCO UNTING (Continued)
· Other non-derivative financial instruments accounted for in the analysis comprise cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accounts receivable and borrowings denominated in currencies different from the functional currency of the entity.
· Correlation effects between currencies are not taken into account. Figures are presented net of tax.
At 31 Decem ber 2012, if NOK had appreciated 10% against all currencies to which the group has significant exposure, net profit after tax from financial instruments would have been NOK 292 million higher (NOK 464 million higher at 31 Decem ber 2011). If NOK had depreciated by 10% at 31 Decem ber 2012 against all currencies to which the group has significant exposure, net profit after tax from financial instruments would have been NOK 292 million lower (NOK 503 million lower at 31 Decem ber 2011). Net profit after tax is affected in a non-linear manner due to changes in the fair value of options. The effect of the sensitivity analysis on the income statement is mainly caused by changes in fair value of derivatives designated as rolling cash flow hedge, and foreign exchange gains/losses on the translation of EUR and USD denominated debt for which there is no hedge accounting. Due to the fact that the portion of debt has decreased in relation to the portion of cash, the effect on the income statement is lower in 2012 compared to 2011. Given a 10% appreciation/depreciation of NOK, equity would have been NOK 180 million higher/lower (NOK 378 million higher/lower at 31 Decem ber 2011) as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on financial instruments designated as net investment hedges. The sensitivity analysis on equity excludes the effects from the sensitivity analysis on the income statement, calculated above.
