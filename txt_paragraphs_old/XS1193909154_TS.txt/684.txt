Each Australian Guarantor will grant a Security Interest over its present and future assets, including the shares held by it in its subsidiaries (subject to and in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles). Security will also be granted over the shares in Norske Skog Industries Australia Limited. The Security Interests will be granted under a general security deed, a specific security deed (in respect of the shares of Norske Skog Industries Australia Limited) and separate real property mortgages. Pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, certain assets will be Excluded Assets. These will include assets which are subject to contractual restrictions on the grant of security interests and assets which are secured in favour of specific third parties where the grant of further security over those assets is not permitted (where there is such existing security and consent is given to the grant of the Security Interest, the security will be second-ranking security).
Accordingly, the Excluded Assets will (except to the extent consent is given by the existing security holders to the grant of security to the Noteholders) include, among other assets:
 the land over which mortgages have been granted by Norske Skog Paper Mills (Australia) Limited to News Limited (see ``D e s c r ip tio n o f O th e r In d e b te d n e s s -- O th e r A r r a n g e m e n ts -- N e w s L im ite d N e w s p rin t S u p p ly a n d R e c o v e r e d P a p e r A g r e e m e n t") which consent is expected to be given;
