(1) The geographical allocation of operating revenue is based on production location.
(3) As reflected in note 3 to our 2011 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and representing the sum of NOK 1,497 million operating revenue from our Energy segment and NOK 2,193 million operating revenue from our Other Activities segment as presented in note 3 to our 2011 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.
Newsprint. Operating revenue from our Newsprint segment decreased by 15.2% to NOK 10,145 million in 2012, compared to NOK 11,967 million in 2011. Total volume of newsprint sold in 2012 decreased by 14.9% to 2,280,000 tons, compared to 2,678,000 tons in 2011. The decrease in operating revenue was primarily due to the closure and disposal of our Follum mill in Norway (March 2012), the divestment of our Bio Bio mill in Chile (May 2012) and the reclassification of Parenco mill operations within our Magazine Paper segment effective January 1,2012. See " --Factors Affecting Comparability-Changes in reporting segments''.
--Europe. Operating revenue from our Newsprint segment in Europe decreased by 25.0% to NOK 4,528 million in 2012 compared to NOK 6,034 million in 2011, reflecting the impact of the closure of our Follum mill and the reclassification of the Parenco mill operations within the Magazine Paper segment. Total volume of European newsprint sold in 2012 decreased by 20.2% to 1,187,000 tons compared to 1,488,000 tons in 2011. The decrease in our European sales volumes principally related to the closure of Follum. Demand for newsprint in Europe fell 13.0% in 2012 as compared to 2011. Newsprint prices in Europe decreased slightly from 2011 to 2012.
-- Outside Europe. Operating revenue from our Newsprint segment outside Europe decreased by 7.3% to NOK 5,263 million in 2012 compared to NOK 5,681 million in 2011, principally due to the divestment of our Bio Bio operations in Chile. Total volume of newsprint sold outside of Europe

decreased by 8.2% to 1,093,000 tons in 2012 compared to 1,190,000 tons in 2011, which decrease was largely due to the disposal of Bio Bio. Demand for newsprint in Oceania fell 12% in 2012 as compared to 2011 while demand for newsprint in Latin America fell 8.0% over the same time period. Newsprint prices outside of Europe remained relatively stable, improving slightly in 2012 as compared to 2011.
M a g a z in e P a pe r. Operating revenue from our Magazine Paper segment in 2012 decreased by 0.6% to NOK 6,254 million compared to NOK 6,291 million in 2011. The decrease in operating revenues reflected weaker pricing for magazine paper in 2012 as compared to 2011. Total volume of magazine paper sold in 2012 increased by 11.0% to 1,308,000 tons, compared to 1,178,000 tons in 2011. The increase in sales volumes reflected the net impact of the reclassification of the Parenco mill operations and the consolidation of its results within the Magazine Paper operating segment and the resumption of production at the Saugsbrug mill which had undergone repairs following a fire at the mill in February 2011. Demand for uncoated and coated mechanical paper in Europe fell 5.0% and 8.0%, respectively, in 2012 as compared to 2011. Prices for magazine paper in Europe were also relatively stable, but declined slightly in 2012 as compared to 2011.
O th e r A c tiv itie s . Operating revenue from Other Activities decreased by 37.2% to NOK 2,315 million in 2012 compared to NOK 3,690 million in 2011. The decrease reflected the divestment of the Reparco global recovered paper business and a lower level of intercompany sales of energy and wood in Norway.
