(2) The fair value of current borrowings equals their carrying amount, as the impact of discounting is not considered to be significant.

The fair value calculation is based on acknowledged valuation principles according to IFRS, but is not necessarily an estimate of the amount the group would have to cover if it were to repay all its debt to all lenders.
