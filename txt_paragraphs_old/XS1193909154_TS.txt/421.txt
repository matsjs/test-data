shall instruct (provided that any such instructions are consistent with certain ``security enforcement principles,'' as set out below) or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit, in each case, taking into account the requirements of each relevant security document and the ``security enforcement principles,'' as set out below.
The following is a summary of the ``security enforcement principles'', which are set out in the Intercreditor Agreement:
(a) It shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction Security to achieve the ``Security Enforcement Objective''. The ``Security Enforcement Objective'' means maximizing, so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from an enforcement of the Transaction Security, recovery by the Primary Creditors.
(b) The security enforcement principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that no additional obligations may be imposed on a member of the Group without the consent of the Parent.
(c) The Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to enforcement will be taken such that either:
i. all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption ` `-- A p p lic a tio n o f P ro c e e d s -- O rd e r o f A p p lic a tio n " (the "Enforcement Proceeds Waterfall '); or
ii. in the event that the Majority Senior Secured Creditors are issuing instructions as to the enforcement of the Transaction Security, sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Enforcement Proceeds Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise).
(d) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious, it being acknowledged that, subject to the other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the time frame for the realization of value from the enforcement of the Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal will be determined by the Instructing Group, provided that it is consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective.
