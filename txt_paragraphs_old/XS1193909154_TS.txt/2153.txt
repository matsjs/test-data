Liquidity risk
Norske Skog is exposed to liquidity risk when payments of financial liabilities do not correspond to the group's cash flow from operating activities. In order to effectively mitigate liquidity risk, Norske Skog's liquidity risk managem ent strategy focuses on maintaining sufficient cash, as well as securing available financing through committed credit facilities. Managing liquidity risk is centralised on a group level, except for countries that have imposed restrictions on cross-border capital flow, where liquidity risk is managed locally.
