The right of avoidance (contestation) in the event of insolvency proceedings
316
challenged legal action or challenged legal transaction took place within a certain ``hardening'' period (which vary from 60 days to 10 years depending on the parties involved in the contested legal action or transaction) and must have caused a direct or indirect discrimination of the other creditors (G la u b ig e rb e n a c h te ilig u n g ); and (iii) the avoidance claim must be filed by the insolvency administrator within one year after the opening of the insolvency proceedings.
In particular, the following legal transactions and legal acts are voidable:
 Avoidance due to intended discrimination ( A n fe c h tu n g w e g e n B e n a c h te ilig u n g s a b s ic h t) : Transactions concluded by the debtor in order to discriminate other creditors may be challenged, if they were entered within 10 years preceding the opening of insolvency proceedings and the other party knew about the debtor's intention to discriminate. In the event that a transaction has a discriminatory effect on other creditors and the contractual counter party should have been aware of this effect, the period is shortened to two years prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings. If the legal act was concluded with close relatives (relatives, in-laws) the transaction may be challenged, unless the relative can prove that he or she did not have, and was not negligent in not having, knowledge of the debtor's discriminatory intent (i.e. the burden of proof is shifted to the relative). Should the debtor be a legal entity with the capacity to be party to legal proceedings, members of the managing and supervisory bodies of the debtor as well as the debtor's shareholders with unlimited liability and as the debtor's controlling shareholders or shareholders with a participation of at least 25% are deemed to be close relatives.
 Avoidance due to squandering of assets ( A n fe c h tu n g w e g e n V e rm o g e n s v e rs c h le u d e ru n g ): Avoidance may apply to certain contracts, including purchase and exchange contracts, entered into by the debtor that are considered a squandering of assets at the expense of other creditors, if the counterparty had, or should have had, knowledge of such squandering. Squandering of assets is assumed if an obvious incongruity exists between the performance and the consideration. Transactions that took place within one year prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings are effected in case of squandering.
 Avoidance of transactions without consideration and analogous transactions (A n fe c h tu n g w e g e n u n e n tg e ltlic h e r o d e r ih n e n g le ic h g e s te llte r V e rfu g u n g e n ): Dispositions of the debtor that were concluded without consideration or are equivalent to such dispositions may be challenged if concluded within two years prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. Examples for such dispositions are: donations, acknowledgement of debt, collateralisation of existing liabilities and payment of someone else's debt. If the debtor receives any economic benefit or interest in return considered as adequate consideration (a n g e m e s s e n e s E n tg e lt) the disposition may not be challenged.
 Avoidance due to preferential treatment (A n fe c h tu n g w e g e n B e g u n s tig u n g ): The payment of or the granting of security to a creditor ( B e frie d ig u n g o d e r S ic h e rs te llu n g ) after or within 60 days prior to a material insolvency or application for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter may be avoided if (i) the creditor obtained security or satisfaction to which it was not, or not in that way or at that time, entitled, unless it was not favored by this transaction (objective preferential treatment) or (ii) the creditor knew or should have known that the debtor acted with the intention to privilege the creditor (subjective preferential treatment) or (iii) the creditor is a close relative, unless such relative can prove that he or she did not have, and was not negligent in not having, knowledge of the debtor's discriminatory intent. Material insolvency means illiquidity or over-indebtedness in terms of insolvency law. Objective preferential treatment does not require any subjective elements on part of the counterparty; in particular the counterparty's knowledge of the financial condition of the debtor is irrelevant. Subjective preferential treatment requires the debtor's intention to favor a creditor and the creditor's knowledge of the debtor's intention. Such transactions carried out more than one year before the opening of the insolvency proceedings may not be contested.
 Avoidance due to knowledge of material insolvency (A n fe c h tu n g w e g e n K e n n tn is d e r Z a h lu n g s u n fa h ig k e it): Legal acts carried out after material insolvency or after application for the opening of insolvency proceedings could be subject to appeal, if the legal act (i) constitutes the payment of or the granting of security to a creditor or (ii) is considered to be a directly or indirectly disadvantageous transaction (n a c h te ilig e s R e c h ts g e s c h a ft). Legal acts by which a creditor's claim is satisfied or secured may only be challenged, if the creditor knew or was negligent in not knowing of the material insolvency or pending insolvency application.
