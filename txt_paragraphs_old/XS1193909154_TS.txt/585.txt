(i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

Layering
No Subsidiary Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and senior in right of payment to such Subsidiary Guarantor's Exchange Note Guarantee; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured, by virtue of being secured with different collateral, by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment- ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness under a Credit Facility.
Liens
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien on any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of any other Person), whether owned on the date of the Exchange Notes Indenture or thereafter acquired, securing any Indebtedness, except (1) Permitted Liens, or (2) if such Lien is not a Permitted Lien, to the extent that all payments due under the Exchange Notes Indenture, the Exchange Notes and any Exchange Note Guarantees are secured on an equal and ratable p a r i p a s s u basis with the Obligations so secured (and if such Obligations so secured are subordinated in right of payment to either the Exchange Notes or any Exchange Note Guarantee, on a senior priority basis) until such time as such Obligations are no longer secured by a Lien.
Any such Lien thereby created in favor of the Exchange Notes or any such Exchange Note Guarantee pursuant to the preceding clause (2) will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the initial Lien to which it relates, (ii) in the case of any such Lien in favor of any such Exchange Note Guarantee, upon the termination and discharge of such Exchange Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Notes Indenture or (iii) any sale, exchange or transfer (other than a transfer constituting a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantor that is governed by the provisions of the covenant described under ``--M e rg e r, C o n s o lid a tio n o r S a le o f A s s e ts ' ' below) to any Person not an Affiliate of the Parent Guarantor of the property or assets secured by such initial Lien, or of all of the Capital Stock held by the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary in, or all or substantially all the assets of, any Restricted Subsidiary creating such initial Lien.
