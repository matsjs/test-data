Expected useful life
Norske Skog has conducted sensitivity analyses with respect to changes in expected useful life of the group's paper machines. If the expected useful life of all the group's paper machines is reduced by one year, the annual depreciation charge will increase by around NOK 70 million.
In connection with the year-end closing process for 2014, Norske Skog performed a review of the expected remaining useful lives of PPE. The expected useful life for the converted Paper Machine 2 at Norske Skog Boyer has been extended with effect from 1 January 2015, as the machine last year was converted to Magazine paper from Newsprint. In addition, a minor extension in the useful life of Paper Machine 10 at Norske Skog Walsum has been made. No other changes in useful life will be made in 2015 compared to those applied in 2014. Because the level of depreciation in 2014 by far exceeded purchases of PPE and the mentioned extensions in useful life from 1 January 2015, the future annual depreciation amount is expected to decrease.
