Where borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities in relation to a member of the Group would otherwise be released pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect (subject to certain conditions) to have those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or, as the case may be, other liabilities transferred to the Parent in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (to the extent legally possible and at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those liabilities.
(i) each Subordinated Agent has approved the release; or
(ii) where shares or assets of a Senior Guarantor or a Junior Guarantor or assets of a Subordinated Debt Issuer are sold:
(a) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);
(b) all claims of the Senior Creditors (other than in relation to performance bonds or guarantees or similar instruments) against a member of the Group (if any), all of whose shares (other than any minority interest not owned by members of the Group) are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security under the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale; p ro v id e d that, if each Senior Agent (acting reasonably and in good faith):
(A) determines that the Senior Creditors will recover a greater amount if any such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates and not released or discharged; and
(B) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,
the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser or one of its affiliates; and
