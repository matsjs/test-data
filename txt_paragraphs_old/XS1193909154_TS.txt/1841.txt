9. DERIVATIVES
Fair value of derivatives
The table below classifies financial instruments measured in the balance sheet at fair value, by valuation method. The different valuation methods are described as levels and are defined as follows:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).
