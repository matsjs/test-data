(2) Capital expenditures, EBITDA, net secured interest-bearing liabilities, net interest-bearing debt, pro forma net secured interest-bearing liabilities, pro forma net interest-bearing liabilities, pro forma net finance costs, the ratio of pro forma net secured interest-bearing liabilities to EBITDA, the ratio of pro forma net interest-bearing liabilities to EBITDA and the ratio of EBITDA to pro forma net finance costs are unaudited.
(4) EBITDA, for any relevant period, represents net profit/(loss) for the period before income taxes, financial items, share of (profit)/loss of associates impairments, other gains and losses, restructuring expenses and depreciation. EBITDA is not a recognized term under IFRS and is not intended to be an alternative to net (loss)/profit or profit before tax as a measure of operating performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for our discretionary use, as it does not take into account certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. We present EBITDA along with our IFRS results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than IFRS results alone. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. You should not consider EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for profit for the year or operating earnings as determined by IFRS, or as a substitute for an analysis of our Consolidated Financial Statements. As described in the sections entitled ``Presentation of Financial and Other Information", ``Summary" and this ``Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Data" of these listing particulars, we use the term " EBITDA" in lieu of the term gross operating earnings due to the familiarity of the term EBITDA to prospective investors in the Notes. In these listing particulars, EBITDA is defined on the same basis as gross operating earnings.
