General
As of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, the Guarantors accounted for 108% of the Parent Guarantor's consolidated EBITDA and held 89% of the Parent Guarantor's total assets. For information on the calculation of EBITDA, see ` `P r e s e n ta tio n o f F in a n c ia l a n d O th e r In fo rm a tio n --N o n - IF R S a n d O th e r F in a n cia l M easures ".
Each Exchange Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor's obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor's obligation under its Exchange Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Exchange Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Exchange Note Guarantee.

A substantial portion of the operations of the Exchange Notes Issuer will be conducted through its Restricted Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Exchange Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, including holders of the

Exchange Notes. The Exchange Notes and each Exchange Note Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Exchange Notes Issuer (other than the Guarantors). Although the Exchange Notes Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and preferred stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Exchange Notes Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock under the Exchange Notes Indenture.
