Provisions for environmental restoration, dismantling costs, restructuring activities and legal claims are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; an outflow of resources is more likely than not to be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions for future environmental and dismantling liabilities are based on a number of assumptions made using management's best judgment. See Note 2 in the annual financial statements for 2014 for a more thorough description of important accounting estimates and assumptions impacting the preparation of financial statements.

Norske Skog is an international company that, through its ongoing business operations, will be exposed to litigation and claims from public authorities and contracting parties as well as assessments from public authorities in each country it operates. Norske Skog has continued the process related to simplification of the group's corporate structure in 2015. The simplification of the group's corporate structure in combination with changes in individual countries' tax laws could increase the group's tax exposure. However, due to completed reorganisations and tax assessments, the overall tax exposure has decreased during the last years.
