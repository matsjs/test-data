13.8.6 The Issuers, the Guarantor and the Ultimate Parent covenant that if any member of the Aban Group receives notice that Sanctions may be imposed against a member of the Aban Group, (1) they will notify the Bond Trustee immediately that Sanctions may be imposed (who shall then notify the Bondholders), and (2) the Aban Group will promptly take all actions that may be necessary in response to such notice in order to avoid the imposition of Sanctions, including the early termination of Iran-related lease and other concessions that may cause the Aban Group to suffer a commercial loss, recognizing that the Bondholders could suffer irreparable prejudice to their reputation and standing if Sanctions are imposed in any manner that could be associated with an investment by the Bondholders and that monetary damages would not be adequate to remedy the harm that Bondholders would suffer in that context. The covenant of the Ultimate Parent shall be documented in a separate document executed by the Ultimate Parent.
