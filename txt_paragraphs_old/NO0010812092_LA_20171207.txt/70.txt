(ii) in respect of any Distributions, 2.75:1 at any time.
(c) The Leverage Ratio shall be measured on the relevant testing date, and then so that: (i) for the purposes of calculating the Net Interest Bearing Debt, the full commitment of any new Financial Indebtedness in respect of which the Incurrence Test is applied shall be taken into account (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of any such new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt) and (ii) the EBITDA shall be calculated as set out in paragraph (d) below.
(d) The figures for the EBITDA in respect of any Relevant Period ending on the last day of the period covered by the most recent Financial Report shall be used for the Incurrence Test, but adjusted so that:
37/55
(i) entities, assets or operations acquired or disposed of by the Group during that Relevant Period, or after the end of that Relevant Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be included or excluded (as applicable) pro forma for the entire Relevant Period;
(ii) any entity, asset or operation to be acquired with the proceeds from any new Permitted Financial Indebtedness shall be included pro forma for the entire Relevant Period; and
(iii) pro forma adjustments shall be made for reasonably identifiable and supportable synergies to be achieved by the Group as a result of an acquisition referred to in sub-paragraph (ii) above (but not taking into account any costs for realising such synergies) annualised with 100% / 75% / 50% / 25% effect per respective financial quarter following such acquisition, investment, disposal or similar, provided that synergies exceeding the higher of (A) 10% of EBITDA and (B) NOK 50,000,000 for any Relevant Period shall be verified by any of the big four accounting firms or any other reputable independent accounting firm acceptable to the Bond Trustee.
(e) The Issuer shall, in connection with any transaction in respect of which the Incurrence Test is to be made, provide to the Bond Trustee a Compliance Certificate containing calculations (showing in reasonable detail) the calculation of the Leverage Ratio, including the Net Interest Bearing Debt and the EBITDA used for the purpose of that Incurrence Test. The Bond Trustee may share such Compliance Certificate with the Bondholders.
