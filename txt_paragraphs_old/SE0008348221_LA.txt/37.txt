(a) The figures for EBITDA, Finance Charges and Net Finance Charges for the Reference Period shall be used for the Maintenance Test, but adjusted so that entities acquired or disposed of by the Group during the Reference Period, or after the end of the Reference Period but before the relevant testing date, shall
be included or excluded (as applicable), pro forma, for the entire Reference Period.
(b) The figures for Net Interest Bearing Debt set out in the financial statements as of the most recent quarter date (including when necessary, financial statements published before the Issue Date), shall be used, but adjusted so that Net Interest Bearing Debt for such period shall be:
(i) reduced to reflect any Net Interest Bearing Debt attributable to a disposed entity or which has been repaid, repurchased or otherwise discharged as a result of or in connection with a disposal of an entity (to the extent such Net Interest Bearing Debt is included in the relevant financial statements); and
(ii) increased on a pro forma basis by an amount equal to the Net Interest Bearing Debt directly attributable to any Financial Indebtedness owed by acquired entities calculated as if all such debt had been incurred at the beginning of the relevant Reference Period.
