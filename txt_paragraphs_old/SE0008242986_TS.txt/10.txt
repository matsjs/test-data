(q) the amount of proceeds received from business interruption insurance and reimbursements of any expenses and charges that are covered by indemnification or other reimbursement provisions in connection with any acquisition, Investment or any sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition of assets; and
(r) any net gain (or loss) realised upon any sale/leaseback transaction that is not sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business, determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer.
For the purposes of calculating Consolidated EBITDA for any period, as of such date of determination:
(i) if, since the beginning of such period the Issuer or any Subsidiary has made any Asset Disposition or disposed of any company, any business, or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business (any such disposition, a "Sale"), including any Sale occurring in connection with a transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, then Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if positive) attributable to the assets which are the subject of such Sale for such period or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if negative) attributable thereto for such period;
(ii) if, since the beginning of such period the Issuer or any Subsidiary (by merger or otherwise) will have made an Investment in any person that thereby becomes a Subsidiary, or otherwise acquires any company, any business, or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business (any such Investment or acquisition, a "Purchase"), including any such Purchase occurring in connection with a transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, then Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Purchase occurred on the first day of such period;
(iii) if, since the beginning of such period any person (that became a Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Issuer or any Subsidiary since the beginning of such period) will have made any Sale or any Purchase that would have required an adjustment pursuant to paragraphs (i) or (ii) above if made by the Issuer or a Subsidiary since the beginning of such period, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Sale or Purchase occurred on the first day of such period, including anticipated synergies and cost savings as if such Sale or Purchase occurred on the first day of such period;
(iv) whenever pro forma effect is applied, the pro forma calculations will be as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer (including in respect of anticipated synergies and cost savings) as though the full effect of such synergies and cost savings were realised on the first day of the relevant period and shall also include the reasonably anticipated full run rate cost savings effect (as calculated in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Issuer) of cost savings programs that have been initiated by the Issuer or its Subsidiaries as though such cost savings programs had been fully implemented on the first day of the relevant period.
