The Issuer shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing (with full particulars) upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any event or circumstance which constitutes a Default or an Event of Default, and shall provide the Trustee with such further information as the Trustee may reasonably request in writing following receipt of such notice. Should the Trustee not receive such information, the Trustee is entitled to assume that no such event or circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Trustee does not have actual knowledge by way of written notice of such event or circumstance.
The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Trustee as set out in this Condition 10 if informing the Trustee would not conflict with any applicable laws or, when the Notes are listed, the Issuer's registration contract with the Regulated Market. If such a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with the Regulated Market or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek approval from the Regulated Market or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Trustee, in order to be able to timely inform the Trustee as set out in this Condition 10.
Information from the Trustee
Subject to the restrictions of a non-disclosure agreement entered into by the Trustee in accordance with this Condition 10.2.1 and applicable law, the Trustee is entitled to disclose to the Noteholders any event or circumstance directly or indirectly relating to the Issuer or the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee may if it considers it to be beneficial to the interests of the Noteholders delay disclosure or refrain from disclosing certain information other than in respect of an Event of Default that has occurred and is continuing.
