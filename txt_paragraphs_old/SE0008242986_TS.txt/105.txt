APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THE TRUSTEE
Appointment of the Trustee
By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder appoints the Trustee to act pursuant to the Trust Deed as trustee in all matters relating to the Notes and the Finance Documents, and authorises the Trustee to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent, unless such consent is specifically required by these Terms and Conditions or the Trust Deed) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Notes held by such Noteholder. By acquiring Notes, each Additional Noteholder confirms such appointment and authorisation for the Trustee to act on its behalf.
The Trustee shall not be bound to take any action in relation to the Trust Deed and these Terms and Conditions unless directed to do so in accordance with Conditions 14, 15 and/or 16, as applicable, and it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction.
The Issuer shall promptly upon request provide the Trustee with any documents and other assistance (in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee), that the Trustee deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents.
