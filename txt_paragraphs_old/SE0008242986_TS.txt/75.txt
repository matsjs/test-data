Admission to trading
The Issuer shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that within sixty (60) calendar days after the First Issue Date, the Note Loan is admitted to trading on the corporate bond list of NASDAQ Stockholm or, if such admission to trading is not possible to obtain or maintain, admitted to trading on another Regulated Market.
Following an admission to trading on the corporate bond list of NASDAQ Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable), the Issuer shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the Notes continue being listed thereon (however, taking into account the rules and regulations of NASDAQ Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) and the CSD (as amended from time to time) preventing trading in the Notes in close connection to the redemption of the Notes).
