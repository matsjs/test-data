Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the Interest Period
8.4
If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it on its due date, default interest shall
accrue on the overdue amount from (but excluding) the due date up to (and including) the
date of actual payment at a rate which is one (1) per cent. higher than the Interest Rate for
such Interest Period. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest
shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Issuing Agent or the
CSD.
