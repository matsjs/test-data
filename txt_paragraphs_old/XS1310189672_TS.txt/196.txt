Defined Contribution and Pension Plans
Our employees in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, France, Belgium and the Netherlands have a pension plan, whereas our employees in Chile, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Italy, UK, Finland and Peru do not. We offer both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. Defined contribution plans are post-employment benefit schemes under which we pay fixed contributions into a separate legal entity and have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. Costs for defined contribution schemes are expensed in the period during which the employee carried out his or her work. Costs are in line with the payments made during the period. Defined benefit plans are post employment benefit schemes other than defined contribution plans. For these plans, amounts to be paid as retirement benefits are determined by reference to a formula usually based on employees' earnings and/or years of service. All pension plans in foreign units are classified as defined contribution plans, with the exception of a limited defined benefit plan in France. All pension liabilities in Sweden are classified as defined contribution plans, except pensions for office-based staff which are through a national multi- employer pension plan, which is funded in the same manner as a defined contribution plan. The level of contribution is dependent upon, among other things, the level of employee participation and salaries in each country.
