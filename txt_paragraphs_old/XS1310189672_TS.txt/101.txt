required to proceed under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the company has its "centre of main interests," as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on Insolvency Proceedings as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No. 663/2014 of June 5, 2014 (the "EU Insolvency Regulation"), at the time insolvency proceedings are commenced. Although there is a rebuttable presumption that the "centre of main interests" will be in the jurisdiction where its registered office is situated, this presumption is not conclusive. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to these companies may proceed under, and be governed by Swedish, Norwegian, Spanish, Portuguese or French laws or potentially by the insolvency laws of another jurisdiction if the centre of main interests of those companies is determined to be in such other jurisdiction at the relevant time. The insolvency laws of such jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as those of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar.
In the event that the Private Senior Notes Issuer, the Guarantors, any future Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.
Guarantees and Private Senior Notes Collateral which may be provided by entities organized in jurisdictions not discussed in this offering memorandum are also subject to material limitations pursuant to their terms, by statute or otherwise. Any enforcement of the Guarantees or Private Senior Notes Collateral after a bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity's jurisdiction of organization or other jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfers, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction's laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Guarantees and limit any amounts that you may receive.
Proceedings could also be initiated in jurisdictions where Private Senior Notes Collateral or the grantor of security interests in the Private Senior Notes Collateral are located, to enforce your rights against such Private Senior Notes Collateral or grantor. Multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. There can also be no assurances that you will be able to enforce your rights effectively in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction's law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Private Senior Notes, the Guarantees and the Private Senior Notes Collateral, as applicable, in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.
