(f) In any case where the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to any clause of this covenant is or may be based on Total Assets, the amount that may be Incurred under such clause shall be deemed to include all amounts necessary to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to such clause. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to such Incurrence, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the amount of Total Assets (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness will be permitted to be refinanced or replaced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing or replacement, such excess will continue).
(h) For purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such eurodenominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Completion Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Completion Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.01, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this Section 4.01 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.
(j) Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor unless (a) in the case of the Issuer, such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes on substantially identical terms or (b) in the case of any Guarantor, such Indebtedness is pari passu in right of payment with the Guarantee of the Notes.
