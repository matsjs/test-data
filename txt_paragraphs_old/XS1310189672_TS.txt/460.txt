The CEO
Note 6 Segment reporting
The group's operating segments are identified by grouping together the business by revenue stream, as this is the basis on which information is provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) for the purposes of allocating resources within the group and assessing the performance of the group's businesses. The group has identified the executive management group as its CODM and the group uses adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, write-offs and integration costs ("adjusted EBITDA") to measure the profitability of each segment. Adjusted EBITDA is, therefore, the measure of segment profit or loss presented in the group's segment disclosures. The group's on-going operating segments are "customer acquisition" and "portfolio services" and are described in note 1. Revenue between segments is carried at an arm s length. Segment information for the group's continuing operations is presented below.
