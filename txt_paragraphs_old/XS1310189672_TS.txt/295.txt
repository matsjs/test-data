The Security Agent will act in accordance with enforcement instructions received from the Majority Pari Passu Creditors save that where:
within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have
not either:
(A) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue, or
(B) appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making such a determination;
and the Majority Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability to effect a distressed disposal or on the expected realized proceeds of enforcement and deliver enforcement instructions to the Security Agent they deliver enforcement instructions which they reasonably believe are necessary or advisable in enhancing the prospects of achieving a prompt and expeditious realization of the value of transaction security; or
(ii) the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice; or
(iii) an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by any Enforcement Action taken by or at the request or direction of a Senior Lender) is continuing with respect to a Debtor,
then the Security Agent will act in accordance with enforcement instructions received from the Majority Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.
