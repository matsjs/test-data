In formulating its decision on such matters described in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems necessary, including one or more Officer's Certificate and Opinions of Counsel; provided that in formulating its decision on matters described in the second paragraph of Section 9.01, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely on an Officer's Certificate, and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is the legally valid and binding obligation of the Issuer and the Guarantors (if any), enforceable against them in accordance with its terms, subject to customary exceptions, and shall not require any additional evidence.
The Issuer will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, to the extent required by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, publish notice of any amendments, supplement and waiver in Luxembourg in a newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Such notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver may also be published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of the Senior Notes Documents, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. A consent to any amendment or waiver under this Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder's Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.
After an amendment under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, in case of Holders of Definitive Notes, the Issuer shall mail to the Holders a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section 9.02.
