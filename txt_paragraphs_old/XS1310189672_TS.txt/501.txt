Management based the value-in-use calculations on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent long-term financial plans approved by the board of the directors, in which the principal assumptions were those regarding sales growth rates, operating margin and change in operating capital employed. Applied pre-tax WACC varies between different countries in the group. In 2014, the lowest rate was 9.1% (8.3) in Sweden and the highest rate was 16.6% (14.6) in Brazil. The rate was 10.7% (8.7) in Norway and 13.9% (11.3) in Spain, for 2014. For the period, subsequent to the long-term plan, cash flows generated by the CGUs to which significant goodwill has been allocated have been extrapolated on the basis of a projected annual growth rate of 3% (3). It is not anticipated that this rate will exceed actual annual growth in the markets concerned. The assumptions regarding WACC are from internal judgement and benchmarking. The annual growth rates are based on historical experience.
