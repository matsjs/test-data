Business com binations were accounted for using the purchase method. G oodw ill arising in a business com bination w as m easured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the interest acquired by the G roup in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business that were recognised on the acquisition date. W here the interest acquired by the G roup in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that w ere recognised exceeded the cost of acquisition, the excess w as recognised as a gain in the incom e sta tem en t. The cost of acquisition com prised the aggregate of the fair values of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assum ed and equity instrum ents issued by the G roup in exchange for control over the acquired business and any costs directly attributable to the business com bination. The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business that were recognised were measured at their fair value on the acquisition date, except for assets that were classified as held for sale, w hich were m easured at fair value less costs to sell. Any non-controlling interests were initially m easured at their share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business that were recognised on the acquisition date. If the initial accounting for a business com bination was incom plete by the end of the reporting period in w hich the com bination occurred, the G roup reported provisional am ounts fo r the item s fo r w hich the accounting w as incom plete. If, w ithin a m axim um of one year after the acquisition date, new inform ation w as obtained ab ou t facts and circum stances that existed on the acquisition date that, if known, w ould have affected the am ounts recognised at that date, adjustm ents were m ade to the am ounts recognised, or new assets and liabilities recognised, as on the acquisition date. Otherwise, with the exception of adjustm ents to contingent consideration and the recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets of the acquired business, adjustm ents to the provisional am ounts w ere recognised in profit or loss. Subsequent adjustm ents to the estim ated am ount of contingent consideration were recognised as adjustm ents to the cost of acquisition. W here deferred tax assets of the acquired business on the acquisition date were not initially recognised but were subsequently recognised, the incom e tax benefit was recognised as incom e but, in addition, the G roup reduced the carrying am ount of goodw ill recognised on the acquisition and recognised the reduction in the carrying am ount of goodw ill as an expense in profit or loss. W here a business com bination w as achieved in stages, the G roup treated each exchange transaction separately and applied the purchase m ethod at the date of each exchange transaction. W here the G roup sold an interest in a subsidiary, the difference betw een the consideration received and the carrying am ount of the interest in the subsidiary that w as sold w as recognised in profit or loss.
(iii) Businesses acquired on or after January 1, 2010
Business com binations are accounted for using the acquisition m ethod. The consideration for the business com bination is m easured at fair value on the acquisition date, w hich is calculated as the sum on the acquisition date fair value of paid assets, liabilities that arise or are assum ed and equity ow nership issued in exchange for control of the acquired business. A cquisition-related costs are recognised in the incom e statem ent during the period in w hich they are incurred. The consideration also includes fair value on the acquisition date of the assets or liabilities arising from an agreem ent concerning contingent consideration.

Changes to the fair value of a contingent consideration as a result of additional inform ation, received post-acquisition, concerning facts and circum stances at the tim e on the acquisition date, qualify as adjustm ents during the assessm ent period and require retrospective restatem ent with corresponding ad ju stm e n t o f g o od w ill. All o th e r cha ng es to the fair value of an ad dition al con sid era tion tha t is classified as an asset or liability are recognised in accordance w ith the applicable standard. C ontingent con sid era tion tha t is classified as e q uity is not rem easured and the su b se q u e n t settle m en t is recognised in equity. The identifiable acquired assets, assum ed liabilities and contingent assets are recognised at fair value as at the acquisition date, with the follow ing exceptions:
· Deferred incom e tax assets or liabilities and assets or liabilities attributable to the acquired com p an y's agreem ent concerning rem uneration of em ployees are recognised and m easured in accordance with IAS 12, Incom e Taxes, and IAS 19, Em ployee Benefits.
· Debts or equity instrum ents attributable to the acquired com pany's share-based allocations or for the exchange of the acquired com p an y's share-based allocations w ith the acquirers are m easured on the acquisition date in accordance w ith IFRS 2, Share-based Payment.
· N on-current assets (or disposal group) w ere classified as held for sale in accordance w ith IFRS 5, N on-current Assets Held for Sale and D iscontinued O perations, and m easured in accordance with this standard.
