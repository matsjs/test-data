(1) The Group has offset deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position where a right of offset existed.
(2) Deferred tax has decreased due to amortisation of the acquisition related intangible assets. Deferred tax has also decreased due to reduced tax rate in Sweden.
Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax loss carry-forw ards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through taxable profits is probable. The subsidiaries in Sweden, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Chile had tax loss carry-forwards of EUR 232.4 million (276.0) at Decem ber 31,2012. Deferred tax assets of EUR 23.0 million (l4.2) at Decem ber 31,2012, have been recognised in respect of these loss carry-forw ards. A tim e lim itation respect of tax loss carry-forward utilisation exists in the N etherlands and in Spain. No such lim itation exists in the other countries. Tax loss carry-forw ards have been capitalised in com panies that have reported losses because the G rou p's business m odel is based on new custom er contracts being loss-m aking initially. The com pany expects profits in the future.
