LO\5845724.11
(e) Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this Section 4.01.
(f) In any case where the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to any clause of this covenant is or may be based on Total Assets, the amount that may be Incurred under such clause shall be deemed to include all amounts necessary to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to such clause. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to such Incurrence, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the amount of Total Assets (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness will be permitted to be refinanced or replaced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing or replacement, such excess will continue).
(g) If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this Section 4.01, the Issuer shall be in Default of this Section 4.01).
