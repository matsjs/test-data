We have a consistent track record of profitable growth despite ongoing economic uncertainty in some of our markets. For example, from 2012 to the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we were able to increase our Portfolio Services Adjusted EBITDA margin from 53.2% to 60.5%. Both in Spain and Portugal, where the effects of the economic downturn were among the most severe in Europe, we continued to expand our operations. Between 2008 and 2010 we were able to grow our customers in Spain and Portugal by 8.4% and 48.9%, respectively despite GDP contracting by 4.0% and 1.0% respectively. In Spain, from 2010 to 2013, during a period of continued economic uncertainty we were able to grow our customers by 6.5%, while GDP fell 2.8%. Likewise, in Portugal during the same period, we were able to grow our customers by 37.6%, while GDP fell by 5.8%.
