Impairment tests
Goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and whenever there are indications that it may have suffered impairment. Goodwill is considered impaired to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the value-in-use and the fair value less costs to sell of the CGU or group of CGUs to which it is allocated. The yearly impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets was done in the third quarter 2014. No need for impairment was identified. In each case, the recoverable amount of all items of goodwill was determined based on value-in-use calculations.
Management based the value-in-use calculations on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent long-term financial plans approved by the board of the directors, in which the principal assumptions were those regarding sales growth rates, operating margin and change in operating capital employed. Applied pre-tax WACC varies between different countries in the group. In 2014, the lowest rate was 9.1% (8.3) in Sweden and the highest rate was 16.6% (14.6) in Brazil. The rate was 10.7% (8.7) in Norway and 13.9% (11.3) in Spain, for 2014. For the period, subsequent to the long-term plan, cash flows generated by the CGUs to which significant goodwill has been allocated have been extrapolated on the basis of a projected annual growth rate of 3% (3). It is not anticipated that this rate will exceed actual annual growth in the markets concerned. The assumptions regarding WACC are from internal judgement and benchmarking. The annual growth rates are based on historical experience.
