services. In Spain, monitoring centers are subject to stringent approvals by the police. Many countries also impose minimum staffing requirements (normally at least two operators must be present) and minimum training standards for operators in monitoring centers. In France, for example, 70 hours of basic training is required for each monitoring center employee.
Equipment and Installation
The equipment we install has, in general, not been formally regulated. However, certain of our markets, including Norway, have a voluntary certification process for security products that allows our customers to save on their insurance premia. In order to install our alarm systems, we generally must be a registered installer in each of our markets. We currently have all required registrations in each of our markets. Some markets impose regulations on the maintenance of our products. France and Spain requires that we provide certified maintenance service as part of each contract we enter into with a customer. Additionally, some markets that do not currently regulate maintenance of residential alarms do regulate business alarms. Such regulations apply to our small business customers. In the future, these countries may expand such regulations to the residential marketplace.
Employees and Pension Obligations
As of December 31, 2014, we had a total of 7,947 employees, of which approximately 42% were located in Spain. After Spain, the highest concentrations of employees were in France and Sweden, with 16% and 7% of our employees, respectively. In Sweden and, to a lesser extent, Norway, Finland and Denmark, we work closely with partners to sell and install our products instead of using our own employees.
Our employees in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, France, Belgium and the Netherlands have a pension plan, whereas our employees in Chile, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Italy, UK, Finland and Peru do not. We offer both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. Defined contribution plans are post- employment benefit schemes under which we pay fixed contributions into a separate legal entity and have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. Costs for defined contribution schemes are expensed in the period during which the employee carried out his or her work. Costs are in line with the payments made during the period. Defined benefit plans are post employment benefit schemes other than defined contribution plans. For these plans, amounts to be paid as retirement benefits are determined by reference to a formula usually based on employees' earnings or years of service. All pension plans in foreign units are classified as defined contribution plans. All pension liabilities in Sweden are classified as defined contribution plans, except pensions for office-based staff which are through a national multi-employer pension plan, which is funded in the same manner as a defined contribution plan. The level of contribution is dependent upon, among other things, the level of employee participation and salaries in each country.
Our Facilities
We lease nearly all properties used for our business, including our global headquarters, R&D centers and those for monitoring centers and local sales offices with the exception of two real estate properties in connection with the acquisition of Homesafety in March 2011. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our material facilities that we currently operate. We lease all the following facilities:
