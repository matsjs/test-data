Section 4.06. Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.
(a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an "Affiliate Transaction") involving aggregate value in excess of 10.0 million unless:
(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or such RestrictedSubsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;
(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of 30.0 million, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority of the Board of Directors resolving that such transaction complies with clause (i) of this Section 4.06(a); and
(iii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of 60.0 million, the Issuer has received a written opinion (a "Fairness Opinion") from an Independent Financial Advisor that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or that the terms are not materially less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's-length basis from a Person that is not an Affiliate.
(b) The provisions of Section 4.06(a) will not apply to:
(i) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to Section 4.02, any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to Section 4.02(b)(ix)(B)(ii)) or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments set forth in clauses (1)(b), (2), (11) and (14) of the definition thereof);
(ii) any issuance, transfer or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other payments, awards
