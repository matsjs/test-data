Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk relates to a negative im pact on G roup profit arising from changes in interest rates. G roup incom e and operating cash flow are substantially dependent on changes in m arket interest rates. An increase in the interest rate creates a risk of an adverse im pact on custom ers' w illingness to invest. Moreover, som e balance sheet items, such as cash and bank balances, interest-bearing investm ents and borrow ings, are exposed to interest rate risk.
A ssu m ing b o rro w in g s under the R evolving C redit Facility are EUR 118 m illion, a lasting increase in interest rates of 1 percentage point w ould, under current conditions (including interest rate derivatives), raise finance costs by around EUR 1 m illion in 2012.
C urrency risk
Translation risk
Translation risk is the risk that the value in EUR of the consolidated incom e statem ent and balance sheet w ill fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates connected w ith translation of the G ro u p 's foreign subsidiaries. As m any of the G roup's subsidiaries operate in foreign m arkets, these effects can be significant. Currency swaps are used m ainly to econom ically hedge lending and borrow ing by the parent com pany in currencies other than EUR. The prim ary currency exposures are to the SEK and NOK. The G roup m ay elect to use qualifying hedging strategies fo r this exposure in the future.
