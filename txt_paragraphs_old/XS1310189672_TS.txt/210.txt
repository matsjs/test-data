We launched limited operations in Brazil in 2011 and acquired a 90% stake in TeleAtlantic in the third quarter of 2014 to further build-out our Brazilian operations. TeleAtlantic had approximately 21,000 customers as of July 31, 2014 and we have also acquired a small portfolio of customers in Chile in 2014. We further added approximately 10,000 customers through our acquisition of Leadex Investments AB in Sweden in May, 2015. Since we first began operations, we have pursued a primarily organic growth strategy when expanding into new markets, including Peru and Italy, complemented by selective add-on acquisitions to bolster our position in existing markets.
