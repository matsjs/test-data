"Super Senior Liabilities" means following the Senior Term Lender Discharge Date, the Senior Lender Liabilities and the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities.
Upon acceleration under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, or enforcement of the transaction security, Senior Secured Noteholders may elect to purchase the lenders' liabilities under the Senior Credit Facilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Senior Secured Noteholders must also elect for the Hedge Counterparties to transfer their Hedging Liabilities to them at the same time in exchange for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.
Restrictions Relating to the Senior Notes

(i)
pay, repay, prepay, redeem, acquire or defease any principal, interest or other amount on or
in respect of, or make any distribution in respect of, any Senior Notes Liabilities in cash or in
