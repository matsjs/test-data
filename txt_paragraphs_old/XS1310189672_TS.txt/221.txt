Customer Service and Support
We also proactively support our customers through a number of quality assurance programs focused on retaining customers. For example, in certain regions we offer our customers a structured training program for the first six months after installation of our monitored alarm systems to familiarize them with their systems, recognizing that the more comfortable customers are at using our products, the more likely they are to maintain their subscriptions. We tailor these programs to the dynamics and culture of each region where we operate.
Alarm Response Coordination
To the extent a triggered alarm is verified, we work with local police forces, guarding companies and fire services to coordinate a response.
Customer Acquisition
Our Customer Acquisition segment focuses on selling and installing alarm systems for new customers. Within this segment, our marketing activities and partnerships generate high-quality leads, which are converted to sales by our sales force and franchise partners.
The origination of each new customer requires a net investment from us, as the costs associated with acquiring a new customer exceed the upfront installation fee we charge. In addition to the costs of the alarm equipment installed, we also have costs associated with sales commissions, sales activities, training of our sales staff, marketing and installation overhead. In the six months ended June 30, 2015, our average cash acquisition cost (including related capital expenditure) per new customer net of installation fees (CPA), was  1,105, representing a 4.0 year payback period.
Our Customer Acquisition segment comprises three primary operating activities: product development; manufacturing and supply; and sales and installation.
