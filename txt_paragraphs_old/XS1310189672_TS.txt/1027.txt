Section 4.02 will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of this Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Completion Date, so that it is classified as permitted under Section 4.01(b)(iv)(C).

In addition, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status.

(b) At the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (ii) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (v) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (vi) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (vii) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (viii) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material
