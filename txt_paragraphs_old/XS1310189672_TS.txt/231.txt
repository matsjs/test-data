We believe that our facilities meet our present needs and that our properties are generally well maintained and suitable for their intended use. Insurance We have obtained liability, property, directors' and officers', and other insurance coverage to the extent we believe necessary to protect our business. We believe our liability insurance is sufficient to meet our needs in the event of future litigation and claims asserted against us. Legal Proceedings At any given time, we may be a party to litigation or be subject to non-litigated claims arising out of the normal operations of our businesses such as product liability, unfair trading and employment claims. We currently believe that our likely liability with respect to proceedings currently pending is not material to our financial position. In December 2014, the Spanish tax authorities finalized an audit of the financial years 2008 to 2011. The tax cost for the finalized period, as well as the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, is 31.2 million and was provided for in our accounts for the 2014 financial year.
