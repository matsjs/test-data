= Market Position As of June 30; 2015
Market leader with scale
In 2014, within the market of currently installed alarms, we were the largest player in four out of five of our largest operating countries, Spain, Sweden, Norway and Portugal, in which we held a relative market share of customers (compared to our nearest competitors) of 4.8 times, 2.8 times, 1.3 times, and 2.1 times respectively. We also believe our market position is further strengthened by high brand awareness in our largest markets.
As the largest pan-European monitored alarm service provider in our markets, we have the flexibility to dedicate necessary resources to marketing, advertising and selling activities to further sustain and grow brand awareness and our subscriber base. For example, management estimates that our sales force in Spain with over 1,500 employees is several times larger than our closest competitor, which we believe has allowed us to continue gaining market share and acquiring new customers faster than our competitors. We believe that the depth and scale of our activities provide us with a significant advantage in competing for talented employees, by allowing us to offer a leading, growing and international career platform. Furthermore, we can invest adequate resources in product development to drive the introduction of new technologies and features into our alarm systems which drives upselling, enhances subscribers' engagement and experience and, as a result, reduces churn.
