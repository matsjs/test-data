M arket risk
Interest rate risk relates to a negative im pact on group profit arising from changes in interest rates. G roup incom e and operating cash flow are substantially dependent on changes in m arket interest rates. An increase in the interest rate creates a risk of an adverse im pact on custom ers' w illingness to invest. Moreover, som e balance sheet items, such as cash and bank balances, interest-bearing investm ents and borrow ings, are exposed to interest rate risk.
A ssum ing borrow ings under the Revolving C redit Facility are EUR 76 m illion, a lasting increase in interest rates of 1 percentage point w ould, under current conditions (including interest rate derivatives), raise finance costs by around EUR 1 m illion in 2013.

Translation risk
Translation risk is the risk that the value in EUR of the consolidated incom e statem ent and balance sheet w ill fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates connected w ith translation of the g ro u p 's foreign subsidiaries. As m any of the g ro u p 's subsidiaries operate in foreign m arkets, these effects can be significant. C urrency sw aps are only used to m inim ise interest expenses charged by banks in our cash pool structures. The prim ary currency exposures are to the SEK and NOK. The group may elect to use qualifying hedging strategies fo r this exposure in the future.
Transaction risk
Transaction risk is the risk of exchange losses being incurred by group com panies from purchases and sales in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiaries concerned. Because transactions w ith other countries arise on only a very lim ited basis in the various subsidiaries, the group currently does not hedge its transaction exposure.
