"Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio" means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of (x) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the period of the two most recent fiscal quarters ending prior to such date of determination for which internal financial statements are available multiplied by 2.0 to (y) the Consolidated Interest Expense of the Issuer for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending prior to such date of determination for which internal financial statements are available. In the event that the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurs, assumes, guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases, retires, extinguishes, amends or reprices, replaces, exchanges or otherwise discharges any Indebtedness and Indebtedness Incurred under any revolving credit facility (unless such Indebtedness has been permanently repaid and has not been replaced) or issues, repurchases or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the "Calculation Date"), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated giving

Whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any transaction or calculation, the pro forma calculations shall be as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer (and may include anticipated expense and cost reduction and synergies), including, without limitation, as a result of, or that would result from any actions taken, committed to be taken or with respect to which substantial steps have been taken, by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, including, without limitation, in connection with any cost reduction synergies or cost savings plan or program or in connection with any transaction, Investment, acquisition, disposition, restructuring, corporate reorganization or otherwise.
