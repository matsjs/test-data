(1) The group has offset deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position where a right of offset existed.
(2) Deferred tax has decreased due to amortisation of the acquisition-related intangible assets. Deferred tax has also decreased due to a reduced tax rate in Spain.

A time limitation in respect of tax loss carry-forward utilisation exists in the Netherlands and in Norway. No such limitation exists in the other countries.
