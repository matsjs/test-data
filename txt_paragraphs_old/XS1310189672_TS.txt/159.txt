In connection with this offering memorandum, the interim financial statement for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and for the six months ended June 30, 2014, has been reissued by the board as of October 1,2015. As the board must consider all available information at the time of signing, in accordance with IAS 10 "Events after the reporting period," an adjustment has been made to the interim financial statements for the above periods due to the agreement with the tax authorities, compared to the interim report that was originally issued. The effect on the financial position is an increase in deferred tax liability and an increase in current tax liability amounting to a total of 34.4 million with a corresponding tax expense in the income statement.
The discussions set forth below provide a separate analysis of each of the line items that comprise our statement of income for each of the periods described below. Changes in foreign currency rates have had a translation impact on our reported operating results in the periods presented below, since a portion of our operations have functional currencies other than our applicable presentation currency. Our primary exposure is to the SEK and NOK, and for the year ended December 31,2014, 63% of our revenue was denominated in euro, 20% of revenue was denominated in SEK, 11% of revenue was denominated in NOK and 6% of revenue was denominated in other currencies. In preparing our financial statements, translations in currencies other than our functional currency are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of transaction. Accordingly, our results for each of the periods presented have been impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates ("FX").
