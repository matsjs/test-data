The group's operating segments are identified by grouping together the business by revenue stream, as this is the basis on which information is provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) for the purposes of allocating resources within the group and assessing the performance of the group's businesses. The group has identified the executive management group as its CODM and the group uses adjusted EBITDA to measure the profitability of each segment. As a result, adjusted EBITDA is the measure of segment profit or loss presented in the group's segment disclosures. The group's on going operating segments are customer acquisition and portfolio services.
