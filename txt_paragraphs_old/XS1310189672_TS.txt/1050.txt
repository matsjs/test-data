(g) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of 30.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the "judgment default provision");
(i) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Guarantee or this Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days;
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Default under Section 6.01(c), Section 6.01(d) or Section 6.01(g) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% of the aggregate euro equivalent principal amount of the outstanding Notes under this Indenture (calculated by reference to the Completion Date Conversion Rate) notify the Issuer (with a copy to the Trustee) of the Default and, with respect to Section 6.01(c), Section 6.01(d) or Section 6.01(g), the Issuer does not cure such Default within the time specified in Section 6.01(c), Section 6.01(d) or Section 6.01(g), as applicable, after receipt of such notice.

Section 6.02. Remedies Upon Event of Default. Holders may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
Holders of a majority in euro equivalent principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (calculated by reference to the Completion Date Conversion Rate) may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, which shall require the consent of each Holder affected thereby unless Holders of not less than 90% in then outstanding aggregate euro equivalent principal amount (calculated by reference to the Completion Date Conversion Rate) waive such Default or Event of Default) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an "Initial Default") then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in Section 4.10, or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in this Indenture.
In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in Section 6.01(e) or Section 6.01(f) has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if, within 20 days after the Event of Default arose, the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to Section 6.01(e) or Section 6.01(f) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration (if applicable) of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.
