principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance
with, this Section 4.01:
(i) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in Section 4.01(a) and Section 4.01(b), the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one (or more, if applicable) of the clauses of Section 4.01(b) or Section 4.01(a);
(ii) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Completion Date under the Senior Credit Facilities shall be deemed initially Incurred on the Completion Date under Section 4.01(b)(i) and not Section 4.01(a) or Section 4.01(b)(iv)(C) and may not be reclassified;
(iii) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;
(iv) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (i), (vii), (xi), (xiii) or (xv) of Section 4.01(b) or Section 4.01(a) and the letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;
