Cost of sales increased by 15.2%, or 62.7 million, to 475.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, from 412.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to growth in sales and the reclassification of direct sales costs with respect to the acquisition of new customers from "Selling and Administrative Expenses."
Selling and administrative expenses decreased by 9.1%, or 30.7 million, to 308.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 338.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Finance Income
Finance income decreased by 93.7%, or 5.9 million, to 0.4 million for the year ended December 31,2013 from 6.3 million for the year ended December 31,2012. This decrease was primarily due to a change in reporting whereby interest income from interest derivatives was netted against interest exposure.
Finance Costs
Finance costs increased by 4.1%, or 9.8 million to 246.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 236.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This was primarily due to an unrealized revaluation effect from intercompany loans in foreign currencies to our subsidiaries.
Income Tax Benefit
Income tax expense was 30.2 million for the year ended December 31,2013 compared to a benefit of 51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in tax benefit was primarily due to revaluation of deferred tax liabilities from our contract portfolio due to reduced tax rates in certain countries in which we operate.
