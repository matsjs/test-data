Strong and stable cash flow generation with ability to flexibly manage growth 2015
Our Portfolio Services segment, which holds our portfolio of approximately 1.9 million customers as of June 30, 2015, generates substantial cash flow through our subscription-based revenues, with Adjusted EBITDA for Portfolio Services of 129.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 (representing a 60.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin) and Adjusted EBITDA for Portfolio Services of
517.1 million on a last quarter annualized basis. The profitability of our Portfolio Services segment results from its relatively low operating cost and capital expenditure requirements (in the Portfolio Services segment, capital expenditures amounted to 5.5% of revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2015). While our subscriber growth is dependent on our Customer Acquisition segment, we have discretion when to invest in acquiring new customers to either replace cancelling customers or grow our existing subscriber base. Our historically low churn rate has meant that we do not need to

divert significant resources towards customer replacement costs. As such, we have flexibility in how we invest the substantial cash flow generated by the Portfolio Services segment. In the three months ended June 30, 2015, we invested 67.1% of our Adjusted EBITDA from the Portfolio Services segment to acquire new customers and used the remaining 32.9% of our Adjusted EBITDA primarily to service our debt and for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. As a result of the discretionary nature of our Customer Acquisition spend, we are able to efficiently manage our growth, reducing our costs and capital expenditure requirements and allowing us to use additional cash flow for debt service requirements or other purposes. If, on the other hand, we invest our additional cash flow to acquire new customers, it allows us to potentially grow our Adjusted EBITDA in the long term.
Track record of profitable growth and deleveraging, including during economic downturns
We have a consistent track record of profitable growth despite ongoing economic uncertainty in some of our markets. For example, from 2012 to the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we were able to increase our Portfolio Services Adjusted EBITDA margin from 53.2% to 60.5%. Both in Spain and Portugal, where the effects of the economic downturn were among the most severe in Europe, we continued to expand our operations. Between 2008 and 2010 we were able to grow our customers in Spain and Portugal by 8.4% and 48.9%, respectively despite GDP contracting by 4.0% and 1.0% respectively. In Spain, from 2010 to 2013, during a period of continued economic uncertainty we were able to grow our customers by 6.5%, while GDP fell 2.8%. Likewise, in Portugal during the same period, we were able to grow our customers by 37.6%, while GDP fell by 5.8%.
