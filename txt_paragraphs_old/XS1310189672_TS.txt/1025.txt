promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the
merger or similar transaction (other than the Acquisition) that is material
to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior
executive officer or director changes at the Issuer or a change in auditors
of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.
(b) To the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not "affiliates" under the Securities Act.
(c) The Issuer shall make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all reports furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer's website and if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and to the extent that the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, copies of such reports furnished to the Trustee will also be made available at the specified office of the listing agent in Luxembourg.
(d) All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 4.10(a) may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. References to the Issuer in Section 4.10(a)(ii) will be deemed to be references to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer with respect to the quarter ending September 30, 2015; provided that such report and financial statements shall include a reasonably detailed description of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In addition, to the extent comparable consolidated or condensed financial information of the Issuer does not exist for any prior period, the combined financial information of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may be provided in lieu thereof. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
