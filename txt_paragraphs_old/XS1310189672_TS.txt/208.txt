Several connected home market participants from different backgrounds (for example, technology, energy and electronics) addressing security and safety are competing against RHSB monitored alarm market participants, although the offerings are distinct.
Large technology companies have well-known brand names and significant technological capabilities and drive towards innovation. However, for the time-being, many of these companies tend to have different focus areas, such as collecting and connecting data (in the case of Google) and providing platforms and interfaces (in the case of Apple, whose HomeKit is a chip-based solution to be built into third-party devices).
For the above reasons, we do not believe that connected home market participants represent a significant immediate threat to our business proposition, where we seek to deliver peace of mind and protection through a technology-enabled human services business, professional grade installation, professional monitoring, response and call-outs.
We believe that, as a result of the connected smart home market, new opportunities are opening up for alarm companies. The addition of new types of connected interactive services has enhanced the value proposition for residential security, expanding the market while creating incremental revenue for the industry. According to a study by Park Associates titled "Competition in the residential market, 2015," the security industry is leading the transition to the smart home. The majority of sensors and control panels sold today can be accessed and remotely controlled with a mobile device.
