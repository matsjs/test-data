(h) The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the "Asset Disposition Offer Period'). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the "Asset Disposition Purchase Date"), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this Section 4.05 (the "Asset Disposition Offer Amount") or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.
(i) On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of 100,000 and in integral multiples of 1 in excess thereof (in the case of the Euro Senior Notes) or in minimum denominations of SEK 1,000,000 and in integral multiples of SEK 1 in excess thereof (in the case of the SEK Senior Notes). The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.05. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent, upon delivery of an Officer's Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of 100,000 in the case of Euro Senior Notes and SEK 1,000,000 in the case of SEK Senior Notes. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this
