In May 2015, Verisure acquired 75% of the Swedish company Leadex Investment AB. Leadex provides security services to residential customers in Sweden via its subsidiaries Alert Alarm AB and TL Detect AB. The purchase price amounted to SEK 119.3 million (approximately EUR 12.9 million). The Leadex group was consolidated in the Verisure Holding group as of 1 May 2015. The acquisition was a strategic acquisition to further strengthen the position on the Swedish market. At the date of finalisation of these consolidated financial statements, the initial accounting for this business combination had not been finalised; accordingly the group reported the provisional amounts currently representing the group's best estimate of the acquisition date values. Those provisional amounts will be adjusted during the measurement period (not to exceed one year from the acquisition date), to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date. For the reporting period, Leadex has contributed EUR 0.8 million to group revenue and EUR 0.0 million to Adjusted EBITDA. The acquisition would, if it had been consolidated from January 1, 2015, have contributed to total revenue with EUR 2.1 million and to Adjusted EBITDA with EUR -0.2 million. Transaction costs of EUR 0.2 million have been expensed and are included in administrative expenses. These costs are included in cash flow from operating activities in the statement of cash flows. No other significant acquisitions were made or announced during the period January to June 2015.
