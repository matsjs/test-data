(f) Each Guarantee granted under this Section 10 by any Guarantor which is organized under the laws of France (a "French Guarantor') shall be limited by the following provisions:
(ii) it shall apply insofar as it guarantees the payment obligationsunder the Notes of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of France which are or become Guarantors from time to time under this Indenture and incurred by those Subsidiaries as Guarantors;
(iii) it shall, in aggregate with such French Guarantor's obligations as guarantor under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Bridge Facility Agreement (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, be limited, at any time, to a guarantee of the payment obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (other than the direct or indirect Subsidiaries of that French Guarantor referred to in Section 10.07(f)(ii) above) under the Notes, the

Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Bridge Facility Agreement (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, up to an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding amounts borrowed directly by that French Guarantor (as Borrower under and as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) or indirectly under the On-Lending Facilities (as defined below) made available to such French Guarantor and/or its Subsidiaries (the "Maximum Guaranteed Amount'), provided that in the event of a payment by that French Guarantor under its guarantees under the Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Bridge Facility Agreement (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the outstanding payment obligations of such French Guarantor under such On-Lending Facilities shall be deemed to be reduced pro tanto for the purpose of this Section 10.07(f)(iii).
For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by a French Guarantor under the On-Lending Facilities shall reduce the Maximum Guaranteed Amount.
For the purpose of this Section 10.07(f), "On-Lending Facilities''' means, in respect of a French Guarantor, the loans made available to such French Guarantor and/or its Subsidiaries as borrowers (including all interest, commissions, costs, fees, expenses and other sums accruing or payable in connection with such amount) to the extent that such loans are financed by way of amounts which are made available to such French Guarantor and/or its Subsidiaries by a Borrower (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreements and/or in the Senior Secured Bridge Facility Agreement (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)) with the proceeds of any Facility (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreements and/or in the Senior Secured Bridge Facility Agreement (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)) and/or by the Issuer with the proceeds of the Notes and/or by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer with the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes, and on-lent (either directly or through one or more other Subsidiaries of the Borrower (as such terms are defined in the Senior Facilities Agreements and/or in the Senior Secured Bridge Facility Agreement (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)) and/or the Issuer and/or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) to, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously on-lent directly or indirectly to, such French Guarantor and/or its Subsidiaries.
In relation to any French Guarantor, the obligations under this Section 10 will not, notwithstanding Section 10.01 (Guarantees), be given on a joint and several basis, it being agreed that the French Guarantors do not act jointly and severally, in each case whether between themselves or with respect to any other Guarantor, as to the obligations of any Guarantor pursuant to the obligations under this Section 10.
