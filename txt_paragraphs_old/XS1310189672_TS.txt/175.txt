Finance Costs
Income Tax Expense/Benefit
Income tax benefit was 2.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a benefit of 30.2 million for the year ended December 31,2013. This change was due to increased tax costs in Spain due to the finalization of the tax audit. We provided for the cost in the amount of 31.2 million for the period of 2008 to 2013. The first payment, amounting to 3.7 million, was made in December 2014. Deferred tax benefit decreased as a result of our use of tax loss carry forwards in Spain and Norway, partially offset by revaluation of deferred tax assets due to a decrease in the tax rate in Spain in 2015.
