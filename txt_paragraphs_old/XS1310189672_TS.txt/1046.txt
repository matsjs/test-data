Section 6.01. Events of Default. Each of the following is an "Event of Default" under this Indenture:
(a) default in any payment of interest on any Notes issued under this Indenture when due and payable, which continues for 30 days;
(b) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under this Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;
(c) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% of the aggregate euro equivalent principal amount of the outstanding Notes (calculated by reference to the Completion Date Conversion Rate) with its agreements contained in this Indenture (other than a default in performance or breach of a covenant or agreement which is specifically dealt with in Section 6.01(a) or 6.01(b) above);
(d) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the Completion Date, which default:
(i) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness ("payment default'); or
(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "cross acceleration provision"),
and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates 30.0 million or more;
