At the time of the approval of the interim report as of June 30, 2014, which was issued in August 2014, there was an ongoing tax audit in Spain. An agreement related to this tax audit was made in December 2014, which resulted in additional income tax of 34.4 million for the three months ended March 31,2014 and for the six months ended June 30, 2014. In this offering memorandum, the interim financial statement for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and for the six months ended June 30, 2014, has been reissued by the board as of October 1, 2015. As the board must consider all available information at the time of signing, in accordance with IAS 10 "Events after the reporting period", an adjustment has been made to the interim financial statements for the above periods due to the agreement with the tax authorities, compared to the interim report that was originally issued. The effect on the financial position is an increase in deferred tax liability and an increase in current tax liability amounting to a total of 34.4 million with a corresponding tax expense in the income statement.
