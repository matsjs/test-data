Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of this Indenture.
(d) On the 396th day after an Asset Disposition (or the 576th day if a binding commitment as described in Section 4.05(b)(viii) above has been entered into), or such earlier time as the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds 50.0 million, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer ("Asset Disposition Offer") to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of 100,000 and in integral multiples of 1 in excess thereof in the case of Euro Senior Notes or in minimum denominations of SEK 1,000,000 and in integral multiples of SEK 1 in excess thereof in the case of SEK Senior Notes.

For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below).
