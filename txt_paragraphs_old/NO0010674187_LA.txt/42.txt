10.4 Mandatory Prepayment
10.4.1
Upon a Mandatory Prepayment Event (other than a Total Loss Event) occurring, the Issuer shall not later than thirty (30) days following the relevant Mandatory Prepayment Event (unless there is an Event of Default in which case it will be promptly), redeem 100% of the outstanding Bonds at a price corresponding to the Call Option level at that time, however, for the avoidance of doubt, based on the date the Mandatory Prepayment Event occurred and not based on the date of repayment.
10.4.2
If the Bonds are redeemed according to this Mandatory Prepayment provision, the entire amount on the Accounts and any amounts received under the relevant sale contract for the Rig or any of the insurance proceeds, may (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement) be used as part payment in relation to the Mandatory Repayment.
10.4.3
Upon a Total Loss Event, the Issuer shall promptly once insurance proceeds are available, but in any event no later than sixty (60) days following the Total Loss Event redeem 100% of the outstanding bonds at 100% of par value (plus accrued but unpaid interest on redeemed amount).
