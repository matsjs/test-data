8.1.3 This Bond Agreement is entered into subject to, and with the benefit of, the provisions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement,
8.2.1 In the event that a new Charter Contract, substituting the Existing Charter Contract is entered into regarding the Rig, the Issuer, and (subject to Clause 8.2.3 below) any other relevant Group Company, shall to the extent permitted by applicable law and the terms of such Charter Contract execute and/or procure the execution of such relevant Security and related documentation as the Bond Trustee may reasonably require in order for the Bondholders to at all times maintain the same Security corresponding to the Security Interest hereunder, also taking into consideration the jurisdiction of incorporation of any Group Company involved in such Charter Contract or the governing law of the Charter Contract and any specific issues related thereto.
8.2.2
If any Group Company grants any additional Security under the Senior Bank Facility, such Group Company shall grant corresponding Security on second priority to the Bond Trustee as Security for the Bond Issue.
8.2.3 New Charter Contracts may be entered into (i) directly between the Issuer and a client or (ii) by the Issuer through a Group Company (the "Charterer"), provided always that the Bondholders in the event of scenario (ii) may obtain a Security position which is no less favourable than would be the case under scenario (i), on the basis of a separate bareboat charter agreement between the Issuer and the Charterer, with the Charterer being the contractual party to the relevant Charter Contract. In the event the Charter Contract is a bareboat charter, the bareboat charter agreement between the Issuer and the Charterer shall be on back-to-back terms with the Charter Contract and with an agreed bareboat rate reflecting the day rate under the Charter Contract, operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and risk allocation between the relevant charterer and the Issuer thereunder, as well as on the basis of applicable tax rules, and otherwise on arm's length terms and conditions, and the following Security (which shall constitute second priority Security, ranking after the Security provided with regard to the Senior Bank Facility ) shall be provided to the extent not already provided hereunder:
(a) a pledge of all the shares in the Charterer;
(b) a pledge over the Charterer's claim against the relevant account bank for the amount from time to time standing to the credit of the Charterer in the relevant earnings account of the Charterer and (to the extent relevant) any operating account of the Charterer; and
17
(c) an on-demand guarantee issued by the Charterer, including such representations and warranties and covenants and events of default provisions as set out in Clauses 7, 13 and 15 herein as the Bond Trustee may reasonably require, which shall apply mutatis mutandis to such Charterer.
