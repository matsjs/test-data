Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default, of which a responsible office of the Trustee has written notice, occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except (subject to the provisions described under "-- Amendment, Supplement and Waiver") to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:
(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
(2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3) such holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;
(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
(5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.
The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding may, on behalf of the holders of all outstanding Notes, waive any past default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of premium, if any, any Additional Amounts or interest on any Note held by a non-consenting holder (which may only be waived with the consent of each holder of Notes affected).
