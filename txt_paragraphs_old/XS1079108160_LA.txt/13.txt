The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at the Issuer's discretion at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in "--Selection and Notice"), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a "Tax Redemption Date") and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes, the Issuer is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts, and the Issuer cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it, and the requirement arises as a result of:
(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or application of such laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which amendment or change is announced and becomes effective on or after the date of this offering memorandum.
The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts or the relevant additional amounts must remain in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that there has been such amendment or change which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that it cannot

avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by the relevant entity taking reasonable measures available to it.
The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Notes.
Mandatory Redemption The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
Repurchase at the Option of Holders Change of Control If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to 1.00 and integral multiples of 1.00 in excess thereof (provided that the Notes may only be transferred in amounts of 100,000 or greater) of that holder's Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"), subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice ("Change of Control Offer") to each holder of the Notes at such holder's registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under "--Selection and Notice", stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Notes on the date (the "Change of Control Payment Date") specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice.
The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with any applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
