(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and
(2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee:
(a) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of 5.0 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer set forth in an Officer's Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with this covenant and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer; and, in addition,
(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of 15.0 million, an opinion of an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of international standing, or other recognized independent expert of international standing with experience appraising the terms and conditions of the type of transaction or series of related transactions for which an opinion is required, stating that the transaction or series of related transactions is (i) fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate.
