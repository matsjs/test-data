(21) Indebtedness by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in an aggregate outstanding principal amount that, when taken together with any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (21) and then outstanding, will not exceed 100% of the Net Proceeds received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Subordinated Shareholder Debt or its Capital Stock (other than in connection with Disqualified Stock or an Excluded Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or an Excluded Contribution) of the Issuer, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however, that (i) any such Net Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the second paragraph and clauses (2) and (4) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below under "--Restricted Payments" to the extent the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (21) to the extent the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under the second paragraph and clauses (2) and (4) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below under "--Restricted Payments" in reliance thereon.
The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral. Intermediary Holding Company will not Incur any Indebtedness other than pursuant to clauses (2), (5) (solely to the extent the Intermediary Holding Company is the obligor on the Indebtedness being refinanced), (6), (7), (8), (9) (solely to the extent it constitutes a guarantee of Indebtedness under clause (1)), (10), (11), (13), (14) or (15) of the definition of Permitted Debt.
For purposes of determining compliance with this "Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Indebtedness described in this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, and from time to time to reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant, provided that Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt may not be reclassified. Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided in clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt.
The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred; provided, however, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated in noneuro currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement with respect to euro the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the euro equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the euro equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally incurred, except that to the extent that:
(1) such euro-equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in which case the Refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence; and
(2) the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the euro-equivalent of such excess will be determined on the date such refinancing Indebtedness is being incurred.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.
The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:
130
