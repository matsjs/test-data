As of the Issue Date all of the Issuer's Subsidiaries will be "Restricted Subsidiaries" for purposes of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under the caption "Certain Covenants--Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries", the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as "Unrestricted Subsidiaries" . Most of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture do not apply to Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
Each Note will bear interest at a rate of 9.500% per annum with respect to Cash Interest (as defined below) and 10.250% per annum with respect to any PIK Interest (as defined below). Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually from the Issue Date or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for, whichever is later. Interest will be payable on each Note on January 3 and July 3 each year, commencing on January 3, 2015. Interest will be payable to holders of record on each Note in respect of the principal amount thereof outstanding as at the immediately preceding December 15 or June 15, as the case may be. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Interest on overdue principal, Cash Interest and PIK Interest, as applicable, will accrue at a rate that is 1.00% per annum higher than the then applicable Cash Interest rate, in the case of overdue principal or Cash Interest, or PIK Interest rate, in the case of overdue PIK Interest, on the Notes. In no event will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided that the Trustee and the Paying Agent will not be responsible for verifying if such rate of interest exceeds the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
Except as provided in the immediately succeeding sentence and the definition of "Applicable Amount", interest on the Notes shall be payable entirely in cash ("Cash Interest"). For any interest period after the first interest period after the Issue Date (and other than the final interest period ending at stated maturity), if the Applicable Amount (as defined below) as determined on the Determination Date (as defined below) for such interest period:
(i) is equal to or exceeds 75%, but is less than 100%, of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest that would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on up to 25% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Notes or by issuing Additional Notes in a principal amount equal to such interest ("PIKInterest")]
114
(ii) is equal to or exceeds 50%, but is less than 75%, of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest that would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on up to 50% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes as PIK Interest;
(iii) is equal to or exceeds 25%, but is less than 50%, of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest that would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on up to 75% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes as PIK Interest; or
(iv) is less than 25% of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest that would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on up to 100% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes as PIK Interest,
provided that, if the average daily balance of cash and Cash Equivalents (net of any amount drawn in cash and outstanding under any revolving credit facility and any other working capital facilities) of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries during the period starting on the 45th day preceding the relevant interest payment date and ending on the 15th day preceding such interest payment date is less than SEK400 million (the "Minimum Cash Balance"), determined on a pro forma basis to give effect to (i) the payment of any Cash Interest payable under the Notes on such interest payment date and (ii) any binding commitment to permanently repay (and cancel any corresponding commitments under) the Senior Facilities Agreement (or any Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge the Senior Facilities Agreement) in cash during the period starting after the 15th day preceding such interest payment date and ending on such interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay PIK Interest on the Notes in such amount so that the Minimum Cash Balance would have been SEK400 million over the same period and determined on the same basis. In such circumstances, the Issuer shall deliver an Officer's Certificate to the Trustee and the relevant Paying Agent (upon which the Trustee and the Paying Agent may conclusively rely) on or prior to the fifth Business Day preceding the relevant interest payment date, which Officer's Certificate shall set forth in reasonable detail the Issuer's determination of such pro forma calculation.
