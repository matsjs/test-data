(8) any Permitted Investments (other than Permitted Investments described in clauses (3) and (15) of the definition thereof);
(10) transactions pursuant to, or contemplated by any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and transactions pursuant to any amendment, modification or extension to such agreement, so long as such amendment, modification or extension, taken as a whole, is not more disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes than the original agreement as in effect on the Issue Date;
(11) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture that are fair to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person;
(12) execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of business; and
(13) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Transaction or other factoring transaction.
Maintenance of Listing The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Euro MTF market for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer determines that they will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Euro MTF market, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on another "recognized stock exchange" as defined in §841 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 of the United Kingdom.
Payments for Consent The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture, to exclude holders of Notes in any jurisdiction where (i) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (ii) the payment of the consideration therefor would require the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the
138
United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent documents) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (B) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.
