(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer's obligations in connection therewith; and
In addition, the Issuer may elect to have the obligations of the Issuer released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation to make Change of Control Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Indenture ("Covenant Defeasance") and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all Events of Default described under "--Events of Default and Remedies" (except those relating to payments on the Notes or, solely with respect to the Issuer, bankruptcy or insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:
(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee (or an Agent designated for such purpose), in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in euros, non-callable European Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euros and non-callable European Government Obligations, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts and premium, if any) on the outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a particular redemption date;
(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion reasonably acceptable to the Trustee of United States counsel confirming that (a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion reasonably acceptable to the Trustee of United States counsel confirming that the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
(4) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer or others; and
(5) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel, subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.
