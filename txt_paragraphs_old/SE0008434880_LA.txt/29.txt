Any Group Company may, subject to applicable law, at any time and at any price purchase Bonds. The Bonds held by a Group Company may at such Group Company's discretion be retained, sold or, if held by the Issuer, cancelled.
The Issuer may redeem all, but not only some, of the Bonds in full on any Business Day falling on or after the date falling 120 calendar days before the Final Redemption Date, at a price equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid interest, provided that such early redemption is financed, partly or fully by way of the Issuer issuing Market Loan(s) in which the Holders shall have the possibility to participate (however subject to the Issuer's decision on allocation).
Redemption in accordance with Clause 10.3.1 shall be made by the Issuer giving not less than 15 Business Days' notice to the Holders and the Agent. Any such notice shall state the Redemption Date and the relevant Record Date and is irrevocable but may, at the Issuer's discretion, contain one or more conditions precedent. Upon expiry of such notice and the fulfilment of the conditions precedent (if any), the Issuer is bound to redeem the Bonds in full at the applicable amounts.
