The Bond Trustee shall not be liable for any delay (or any related consequences) in crediting an account with an amount required pursuant to the Finance Documents to be paid by the Bond Trustee to the Holders, provided that the Bond Trustee has taken all necessary steps as soon as reasonably practicable to comply with the regulations or operating procedures of any recognised clearing or settlement system used by the Bond Trustee for that purpose.
Any liability towards the Issuer which is incurred by the Bond Trustee in acting under, or in relation to, the Finance Documents shall not be subject to set-off against the obligations of the Issuer to the Holders under the Finance Documents.
Replacement of the Bond Trustee
Subject to Clause 21.4.6, the Bond Trustee may resign by giving notice to the Issuer and the Holders, in which case the Holders shall appoint a successor Bond Trustee at a Holders' Meeting convened by the retiring Bond Trustee or by way of Written Procedure initiated by the retiring Bond Trustee.
Subject to Clause 21.4.6, if the Bond Trustee is insolvent, the Bond Trustee shall be deemed to resign as Bond Trustee and the Issuer shall within 10 Banking Days appoint a successor Bond Trustee which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable company which regularly acts as bond trustee under debt issuances.
A Holder (or Holders) representing at least 10 per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount may, by notice to the Issuer (such notice may only be validly given by a person who is a Holder on the Banking Day immediately following the day on which the notice is received by the Issuer and shall, if given by several Holders, be given by them jointly), require that a Holders' Meeting is held for the purpose of dismissing the Bond Trustee and appointing a new Bond Trustee. The Issuer may, at a Holders' Meeting convened by it or by way of Written Procedure initiated by it, propose to the Holders that the Bond Trustee be dismissed and a new Bond Trustee appointed.
If the Holders have not appointed a successor Bond Trustee within 90 calendar days after (i) the earlier of the notice of resignation was given or the resignation otherwise took place or (ii) the Bond Trustee was dismissed through a decision by the Holders, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Bond Trustee which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable company which regularly acts as bond trustee under debt issuances.
