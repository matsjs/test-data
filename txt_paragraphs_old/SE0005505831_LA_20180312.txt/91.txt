the Adjusted Nominal Amount (such request may only be validly made by a person who is
received by the Bond Trustee and shall, if made by several Holders, be made by them
jointly) for a decision by the Holders on a matter relating to the Finance Documents shall
be directed to the Bond Trustee and dealt with at a Holders' Meeting or by way a Written
Procedure, as determined by the Bond Trustee. The person requesting the decision may
suggest the form for decision making, but if it is in the Bond Trustee's opinion more
appropriate that a matter is dealt with at a Holders' Meeting than by way of a Written
Procedure, it shall be dealt with at a Holders' Meeting.
