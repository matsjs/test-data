The retiring Bond Trustee shall, at its own cost, make available to the successor Bond Trustee such documents and records and provide such assistance as the successor Bond Trustee may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Bond Trustee under the Finance Documents.
The Bond Trustee's resignation or dismissal shall only take effect upon the appointment of a successor Bond Trustee and acceptance by such successor Bond Trustee of such appointment and the execution of all necessary documentation to effectively substitute the retiring Bond Trustee.
Upon the appointment of a successor, the retiring Bond Trustee shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the Finance Documents and remain liable under the Finance Documents in respect of any action which it took or failed to take whilst acting as Bond Trustee. Its successor, the Issuer and each of the Holders shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves under the Finance Documents as they would have had if such successor had been the original Bond Trustee.
In the event that there is a change of the Bond Trustee in accordance with this Clause 21.4 (Replacement o f the Bond Trustee), the Issuer shall execute such documents and take such actions as the new Bond Trustee may reasonably require for the purpose of vesting in such new Bond Trustee the rights, powers and obligation of the Bond Trustee and releasing the retiring Bond Trustee from its further obligations under the Finance Documents. Unless the Issuer and the new Bond Trustee agrees otherwise, the new Bond Trustee shall be entitled to the same fees and the same indemnities as the retiring Bond Trustee.
The Issuer and the Guarantor hereby expressly accept and confirm, for the purposes of articles 1278 and 1281 of the Luxembourg civil code, that notwithstanding any assignment, transfer and/or novation permitted under, and made in accordance with the provisions of these Terms and Conditions and the Guarantee or any agreement referred to herein to which the Issuer and the Guarantor is a party, any security created or guarantee given under these Terms and Conditions and the Guarantee shall be preserved for the benefit of the Bond Trustee (for itself and the Holders) and, for the avoidance of doubt, for the benefit of each of the Bond Trustee and the Holders.
