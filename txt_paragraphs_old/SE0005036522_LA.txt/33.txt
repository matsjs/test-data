13 Delisting Event or Listing Failure
13.1 Upon a Delisting Event or a Listing Failure, each Holder shall have a right of pre-payment (a "Put Option") of its Bonds at a price of 100.00 per cent of the Nominal Amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in accordance with Section 9 from but excluding the Issue Date or the preceding Interest Payment Date, as applicable, up to and including the relevant settlement date of the Put Option (the "Put Option Redemption Amount").
13.2 The Company shall notify the Bond Trustee and the Holders of the occurrence of a Delisting Event or a Listing Failure as soon as possible after the Company has become aware of the Delisting Event or the Listing Failure. The Put Option must be exercised by the Holders, by giving the Bond Trustee and the Issuing Agent written notice in accordance with Section 21, within 60 calendar days after the Company has given such notification to the Bond Trustee and the Holders (the "Exercise Period"). Bonds held by a Holder who has exercised the Put Option shall be blocked from transactions by way of transferring the Bonds to the Issuing Agent (to an account specified by the Issuing Agent in a notice given to the Holders).
