(i) a decision is made that any Material Group Company shall be merged or demerged into a company which is not a Group Company, unless the Bond Trustee has given its consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) in writing prior to the merger and/or demerger (where consent is not to be understood as a waiver of the rights that applicable law at the time assigns the concerned creditors); or
(g) any expropriation, attachment, sequestration, distress or execution or any analogous process in any jurisdiction affects any asset or assets of any Material Group Company having an aggregate value equal to or exceeding SEK 5,000,000 and is not discharged within 30 calendar days;
(h) it is or becomes impossible or unlawful for the Company to fulfil or perform any of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions or if the obligations under these Terms and Conditions are not, or cease to be, legal, valid, binding and enforceable; or
(i) the Company or any Material Group Company ceases to carry on its business, except if due to (i) a permitted merger or demerger as stipulated in Section 14.1 (f) above, or (ii) a permitted disposal of assets as stipulated in Section 12.1 (e).
14.2 If the Bonds are declared due and payable, the Company shall redeem the Bonds at a redemption amount equal to 101.00 per cent of the Nominal Amount plus the accrued and unpaid interest, if any, pursuant to Section 9 from but excluding the preceding Interest Payment Date (or, if such date has not occurred, the Issue Date), up to and including the payment date.
14.3 Termination for payment prematurely on the grounds mentioned in Sections 14.1 (b) and (c)
& above or, regarding any of the Subsidiaries, on the grounds mentioned in Sections 14.1 (d), (e),
(f), (g), (h) and (i) above may only occur if the nature of the particular circumstance is such that it would have a Material Adverse Effect and that the cause of termination is continuing at the time of the Bond Trustee's declaration. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned in Section 14.1 (d).
14.4 The Bond Trustee shall only give its consent to a merger and/or demerger in accordance with Section 14.1 (f) (i) if an accountant, engaged in accordance with Section 15,2 (e), has assured that the merger and/or demerger will not have a Material Adverse Effect.
