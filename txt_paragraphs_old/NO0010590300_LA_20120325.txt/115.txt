(c) agree with the Bond Trustee (on behalf o f the Bondholders) that if, for any reason, any amount claimed by the Bond Trustee under this clause is not recoverable from the Guarantors, then the Guarantors will be liable as a principal debtor and primary obligor to indemnify the Bond Trustee and each Bondholder for any loss each o f them may incur as a result o f the Issuer failing to pay any amount expressed to be payable by it under a Finance Document on the date when it ought to have been paid.
19.2 Each Guarantor hereby waives:
(a) any requirement that the Bond Trustee or any o f the Bondholders in case o f an Event o f Default first have to make demand upon or seek to enforce remedies against the Issuer;
(b) any right to exercise right o f subrogation into the rights o f the Bondholders under the Bond Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Bond Trustee until such time that no amounts are outstanding under this Bond Agreement and any other Finance Document; and
