STATUS OF THE NOTES
By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder agrees that the Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Notes, each subsequent Noteholder confirms such agreement.
The nominal amount of each Note is SEK 1,000,000 (the "Nominal Amount"). All Initial Notes are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 100 per cent. of the Nominal Amount.
Provided that no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue, the Issuer may, at one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Notes. Subsequent Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate, the nominal amount and the final maturity applicable to the Initial Notes shall apply to Subsequent Notes. The price of the Subsequent Notes may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal Amount. The maximum total nominal
7(2)
amount of the Notes (the Initial Notes and all Subsequent Notes) may not exceed SEK 250,000,000 unless a consent from the Noteholders is obtained in accordance with Clause 15.5(a). Each Subsequent Note shall entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with Clause 8.1, and shall otherwise have the same rights as the Initial Notes.
2.5
The Notes constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of
the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu and without any preference among them.
