the request is received by the Agent and shall, if made by several Noteholders, be made by
Documents shall be directed to the Agent and dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting or by
way a Written Procedure, as determined by the Agent. The person requesting the decision
may suggest the form for decision making, but if it is in the Agent's opinion more
appropriate that a matter is dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting than by way of a Written
Procedure, it shall be dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the appointment of a Noteholders' Committee shall always be dealt with at a Noteholders'
Meeting.
