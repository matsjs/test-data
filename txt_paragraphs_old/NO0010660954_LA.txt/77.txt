18.2 Defeasance
(a)
the Issuer shall have irrevocably pledged to the Bond Trustee for the benefit of the
Bondholders cash or government obligations accepted by the Bond Trustee (the
"Defeasance Pledge") in such amounts as will be sufficient for the payment of
principal (including if applicable premium payable upon exercise of a Call Option)
and interest on the Outstanding Bonds to Maturity Date (or redemption upon a
exercise of a notified Call Option);
(b) the Issuer shall, if required by the Bond Trustee, provide a legal opinion reasonable acceptable to the Bond Trustee to the effect that the Bondholders will not recognize income, gain or loss for income tax purposes (including under US federal or Norwegian laws, if applicable) as a result of the Defeasance Pledge and Covenant Defeasance, and will be subject to such income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the Defeasance Pledge had not occurred;
