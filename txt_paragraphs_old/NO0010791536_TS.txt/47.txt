Each Bond carries Interest at the Interest Rate applied to the Nominal Amount from (and including) the Issue Date up to (but excluding) the relevant Redemption Date.
Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve months of 30 days each and, in case of an incomplete month, the actual number of days elapsed (30/360-days basis).
If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it under the Finance Documents on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from (and including) the due date up to (but excluding) the date of actual payment at a rate which is five (5) per cent, higher than the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Trustee or the CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
REDEMPTION AND REPURCHASE OF THE BONDS
Redemption at maturity and extension
Subject to Clause 12.1.2 below, the Issuer shall redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Bonds in full on the Final Maturity Date with an amount per Bond equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
The Issuer has the right to extend the original Final Maturity Date with six (6) months by giving notice to the Trustee at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the original Final Maturity Date. If so requested by the Issuer, the Issuer shall redeem the outstanding Bonds on the date falling six (6) months after the original Final Maturity Date with an amount per Bond equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
Purchase of Bonds by Group Companies
Any Group Company may, subject to applicable law, at any time and at any price purchase Bonds on the market or in any other way. Bonds held by a Group Company may at such Group Company's discretion be retained or sold or, if held by the Issuer, cancelled by the Issuer.
