(b) Consultation
(ii) Subject to paragraph (b)(iii) below, if the Security Agent has received Conflicting Enforcement Instructions, the Security Agent shall promptly notify the Representatives and the Representatives will consult with each other and the Security Agent (as the case may be) in good faith for a period of not less than 30 days (or such shorter period as the Representatives may agree) (the "Consultation Period") from the earlier of (A) the date of the latest such Conflicting Enforcement Instruction and (B) the date falling ten (10) Business Days after the date on which the original Enforcement Proposal is delivered in accordance with paragraph (b)(i) above, with a view to agreeing instructions as to enforcement.
(iii) The Representatives shall not be obliged to consult (or, in the case of (B) below, shall be obliged to consult for such shorter period as the Instructing Party may determine) in accordance with paragraph (b)(ii) above if:
(A) the Transaction Security or the Guarantees have become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or
(B) each of the Super Senior Creditors, the Bondholders (represented by the Bonds Agent), the Hedge Counterparty and any New Creditor, if any, agree that no Consultation Period is required.
(iv) If consultation has taken place during the Consultation Period there shall be no further obligation to consult and the Security Agent may act in accordance with the instructions as to enforcement then or previously received from the Instructing Party and the Instructing Party may issue instructions as to enforcement to the Security Agent at any time thereafter.
(v) If (A) no enforcement instructions have been issued to the Security Agent from the Instructing Party within three (3) months from the end of the Consultation Period, or (B) no proceeds from an enforcement of the Transaction Security or the Guarantees have been received by the Security Agent within six (6) months from the end of the Consultation Period, then the Super Senior Creditors shall become the Instructing Party and be entitled to give Enforcement Instructions for a period of three (3) months.
(vi) If a Secured Party (acting reasonably) considers that the Security Agent is enforcing the Security in a manner which is not consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective, such Secured Party shall give notice to the other Secured Parties after which the Representatives and the Security Agent shall consult for a period of twenty (20) days (or such lesser period that the Secured Parties may agree) with a view to agreeing on the manner of enforcement.
