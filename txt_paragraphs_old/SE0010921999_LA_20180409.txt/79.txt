(a) if the Intercreditor Agreement has been entered into, all payments by the Issuer or the Guarantors (as applicable) relating to the Bonds and any proceeds received form an enforcement of the Transaction Security shall be distributed in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement; and
33
Transaction Security shall be distributed in the following order of priority, in accordance with the instructions of the Trustee:
(i) first, in or towards payment pro rata of amounts owing to the Trustee under the Finance Documents, including all costs and indemnities relating to the acceleration of the Bonds, the enforcement of the Transaction Security or the Guarantees or the protection of the Holders' rights under the Finance Documents;
(ii) secondy, in or towards payment pro rata of accrued but unpaid Interest under the Bonds (Interest due on an earlier Interest Payment Date to be paid before any Interest due on a later Interest Payment Date);
(iii) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid principal under the Bonds; and
(iv) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under the Finance Documents;
Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (i) to (iv) above shall be paid to the Issuer or the Guarantors (as applicable). The application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (i) to (iv) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal.
16.2 If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in Clause 16.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way of a corresponding distribution in accordance with Clause 16.1.
