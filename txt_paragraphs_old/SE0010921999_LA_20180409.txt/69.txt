(i) the Initial Bonds are listed at the corporate bond list on a Regulated Market within twelve (12) months of the First Issue Date; and

and shall take all measures required to ensure that the Initial Bonds (and any Subsequent Bonds as applicable), once listed on a Regulated Market, continue being listed such Regulated Market for as long as any Bond is outstanding (however, taking into account the rules and regulations of that Regulated Market and the CSD (as amended from time to time) preventing trading in the Bonds in close connection to the redemption of the Bonds) and that, upon any Subsequent Bond Issue, the volume of Bonds listed on the relevant Regulated Market promptly, but not later than ten (10) Business Days after the relevant Issue Date, is increased accordingly.
14.3 Nature of business
The Issuer shall procure that no substantial change is made to the general nature of the business carried on by the Group as of the First Issue Date if such substantial change would have a Material Adverse Effect.
14.4 Financial Indebtedness
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of the Subsidiaries will, incur any new Financial Indebtedness, or maintain or prolong any existing Financial Indebtedness, provided however that the Issuer and the Subsidiaries have a right to incur, maintain or prolong any Financial Indebtedness that constitutes Permitted Debt.
14.5 Disposal of assets
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of the Subsidiaries, sell or otherwise dispose of shares in any Group Company or of all or substantially all of its or any Subsidiary's assets (including but not limited to material intellectual property rights) or operations to any person not being the Issuer or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, unless the transaction is carried out at fair market value and on terms and conditions customary for such transaction and provided that it does not have a Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the above and subject to the pre-agreed right to dispose of up to five (5) per cent. of the share capital of the Issuer to facilitate a management incentive program, a Group Company may not dispose of shares which have been pledged in order to secure the obligations under the Finance Documents unless the Trustee (acting in its sole discretion) has provided its prior written approval,.
