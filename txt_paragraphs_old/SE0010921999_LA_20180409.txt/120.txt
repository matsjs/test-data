(vi) If a Secured Party (acting reasonably) considers that the Security Agent is enforcing the Security in a manner which is not consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective, such Secured Party shall give notice to the other Secured Parties after which the Representatives and the Security Agent shall consult for a period of twenty (20) days (or such lesser period that the Secured Parties may agree) with a view to agreeing on the manner of enforcement.
(i) Upon an enforcement of the Transaction Security, the proceeds shall be distributed in accordance with the Application of Enforcement Proceeds set out below.
(ii) Any Enforcement Action required to be taken by the Representative in accordance with agreed Enforcement Instructions pursuant to paragraph (b) above, shall be taken by such Representative at the request of the Security Agent.
(iii) All security and/or guarantees or arrangement having similar effects may be released by the Security Agent, without the need for any
further referral to or authority from anyone, upon any enforcement provided that the proceeds are distributed in accordance with the provisions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.
(iv) Funds that the Security Agent receives (directly or indirectly) in connection with the enforcement of the Transaction Security shall constitute escrow funds (Sw. redovisningsm edel) and must be held on a separate account on behalf of the Secured Parties or the Issuer as the case may be. The Security Agent shall promptly arrange for payments to be made in accordance with the application of proceeds set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement.
(v) Nothing herein shall preclude the rights of the Super Senior Creditors or the Bonds Agent to join or intervene in or otherwise support any proceedings arising from insolvency proceedings or do such other things as may be necessary to maintain a claim or security, always as long as such action does not adversely affect the rights of the other Secured Creditors or the Security Agent and is not inconsistent with its obligations contained in the Intercreditor Agreement and each of the Super Senior Creditors and the Bonds Agent shall give prompt notice to the other of any action taken by it to join, intervene or otherwise support any such proceedings.
(vi) For avoidance of doubt, customary provisions regarding permitted (or required) actions once an Insolvency Event has occurred to be included in the Intercreditor Agreement.
"Conflicting Enforcement Instructions" means instructions (or proposed instructions) as to enforcement of the Transaction Security or the taking of any Enforcement Action delivered to the Security Agent by a Representative that are inconsistent as to the manner of enforcement (including any inconsistency as to the timeframe for realising value from an enforcement of the Transaction Security or the Guarantees or a distressed disposal), it being understood that, for the purpose of triggering the consultation requirements under paragraph (b)(ii) above only and not for any other purpose (including, without limitation, determining the Instructing Party), the failure to give instructions by either the Super Senior Creditors or Senior Representative will be deemed to be an instruction inconsistent with any other instructions given.
