The Issuer may give notice of redemption pursuant to Clause 10.6.1 and repurchase pursuant to Clause 10.6.2 no later than twenty (20) Business Days after having received actual knowledge of any event specified therein (after which time period such right shall lapse). The Notice from the Issuer is irrevocable, shall specify the Redemption Date and also the Record Date on which a person shall be registered as a Bondholder to receive the amounts due on such Redemption Date. The Issuer is bound to redeem, or repurchase (in which case each relevant Bondholder is bound to sell), as the case may be, the Bonds in full at the applicable amount on the specified Redemption Date.
The Issuer shall immediately notify the Bondholders and the Agent upon becoming aware of the occurrence of a Change of Control Event.
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, each Bondholder shall during a period of sixty (60) Business Days from the effective date of a notice from the Issuer of the Change of Control Event pursuant to Clause 12.2.1 (after which time period such right shall lapse), have the right to request that all, or some only, of its Bonds be repurchased at a price per Bond equal to 100.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest. However, such period may not start earlier than upon the occurrence of the Change of Control Event.
The notice from the Issuer pursuant to Clause 12.2.1 shall specify the Record Date on which a person shall be registered as a Bondholder to receive interest and principal, the Redemption Date and include instructions about the actions that a Bondholder needs to take if it wants Bonds held by it to be repurchased. If a Bondholder has so requested, and acted in accordance with the instructions in the notice from the Issuer, the Issuer shall repurchase the relevant Bonds and the repurchase amount shall fall due on the Redemption Date specified in the notice given by the Issuer pursuant to Clause 12.2.1. The Redemption Date must fall no later than forty (40) Business Days after the end of the period referred to in Clause 10.7.1.
