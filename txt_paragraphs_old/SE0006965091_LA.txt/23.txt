By subscribing for Bonds, the initial Bondholder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Bondholder confirms such agreement.
The Bonds constitute direct, general, unconditional, unsubordinated, guaranteed and secured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu and without any preference among them and at least pari passu with all other direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer.
The Bonds are freely transferable but the Bondholders may be subject to purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Bonds, as applicable, under local laws to which a Bondholder or the Bonds may be subject. Each Bondholder must ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.
No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden or Norway, where action for that purpose is required. Each Bondholder must inform itself about, and observe, any applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds.
The Parent irrevocably appoints the Issuer to act on its behalf as its agent in relation to the Finance Documents. The Issuer may on behalf of the Issuer (i) supply information to the Agent and the Bondholders, (ii) give and receive notices, instructions and other communications under the Finance Documents, and (iii) make agreements and effect amendments, supplements and variations relating to the Finance Documents.
USE OF PROCEEDS
Upon release from the Escrow Account, the Issuer shall exclusively employ the Net Proceeds from the issue of the Bonds, as follows:
(a) first, the Refinancing Proceeds to refinance the Existing Debt; and
(b) secondly, the Refurbishment Proceeds to finance the Refurbishments, as evidenced by the Refurbishment Plan.
