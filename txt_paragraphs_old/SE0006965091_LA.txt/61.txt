When the financial statements and other information are made available to the Bondholders pursuant to Clause 12.1.1, the Issuer shall send copies of such financial statements and other information to the Agent. Together with the financial statements, the Issuer shall submit to the Agent a compliance certificate certified by the Issuer containing a confirmation that no Event of Default has occurred (or if an Event of Default has occurred, what steps have been taken to remedy it). The compliance certificate shall be in a form agreed between the Issuer and the Agent and include figures in respect of the financial covenants pursuant to Clause 14.1 (Interest Coverage Ratio) and 14.2 (Property LTV) as well as the basis on which they have been calculated as well as information pursuant to Clause 15.14 (Distribution restriction) and Clause 16.10 (Financial Indebtedness restriction and Distribution restriction (Incurrence test)).
Information from the Agent
Subject to the restrictions of a non-disclosure agreement entered into by the Agent in accordance with Clause 12.3.2, the Agent is entitled to disclose to the Bondholders any event or circumstance directly or indirectly relating to the Group or the Bonds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agent may if it considers it to be beneficial to the interests of the Bondholders delay disclosure or refrain from disclosing certain information other than in respect of an Event of Default that has occurred and is continuing.
If a committee representing the Bondholders' interests under the Finance Documents has been appointed by the Bondholders in accordance with Clause 20 (Decisions by Bondholders), the members of such committee may agree with the Issuer not to disclose information received from the Issuer, provided that it, in the reasonable opinion of such members, is beneficial to the interests of the Bondholders. The Agent shall be a party to such agreement and receive the same information from the Issuer as the members of the committee.
