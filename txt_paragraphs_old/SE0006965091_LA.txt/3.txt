EXECUTION VERSION 2(46)
For the purpose of calculating the Applicable Amount, the "SEK treasury rate" means direct obligations of Sweden (statsobligationer) with a fixed maturity (as officially compiled and published in the most recent financial statistics that has become publicly available not more than five (5) and not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Record Date (or if such financial statistics are not published or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Issuer acting in good faith) most nearly equal to the period from the Record Date to the Interest Payment Date in March 2018, provided that:
(a) if the period from the Record Date to the Interest Payment Date in March 2018 is not equal to the fixed maturity of a direct obligation of Sweden for which a weekly average yield is given, the SEK treasury rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation from the weekly average yields of direct obligations of Sweden for which such yields are given; and
(b) if the period from the Record Date to the Interest Payment Date in March 2018 is less than one (1) year, the weekly average yield on actually traded direct obligations of Sweden adjusted to a fixed maturity of one year shall be used.
