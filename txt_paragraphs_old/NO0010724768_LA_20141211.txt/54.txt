14.5 Conversion will be effected by a set-off of the total Face Value of the Bonds to be converted against the issuing of the whole number of Shares resulting from dividing the total Face Value of the Bonds to be converted by the Conversion Price. Any excess amount beyond the whole number of Shares converted by the Bonds shall fall to the Issuer and accordingly fractions of Shares will not be issued or transferred upon exercise o f a Conversion Right and no cash payment will be made in lieu thereof. Where Conversion Rights are exercised by a Bondholder in respect of more than one Bond, the number o f Shares to be issued will be determined on the basis of the aggregate Face Value o f such Bonds.
