(f) When the requisite majority consents of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount pursuant to paragraphs (e) and (f) of Clause 14 (Decisions by Bondholders) have been received in a Written Procedure, the relevant decision shall be deemed to be adopted pursuant to paragraphs (e) and (f) of Clause 14 (Decisions by Bondholders), as the case may be, even if the time period for replies in the Written Procedure has not yet expired.
(a) The Issuer and the Agent (acting on behalf of the Bondholders) may agree to waive and/or amend the Finance Documents, provided that:
(i) such wavier and/or amendment does not adversely affect the interest of the Bondholders, or is made solely for the purpose of rectifying obvious errors and mistakes:
(ii) such wavier and/or amendment is required by applicable law, a court ruling or a decision by a relevant authority: or
(iii) such waiver and/or amendment has been duly approved by the Bondholders in accordance with Clause 14 (Decisions by Bondholders).
(b) The Agent shall promptly notify the Bondholders of any waivers and/or amendments made in accordance with paragraph (a) above, setting out the date from which the waivers and/or amendments will be effective, and ensure that the waivers and/or amendments are duly registered with the CSD and each other relevant organisation or authority.
18. Appointment and Replacement of the Agent
18.1 Appointment of Agent
(a) By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Bondholder appoints the Agent to act as its agent in all matters relating to the Bonds and the Finance Documents, and authorises the Agent to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent, unless such consent is specifically required by these Terms and Conditions) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Bonds held by such Bondholder. By acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Bondholder confirms such appointment and authorisation for the Agent to act on its behalf.
