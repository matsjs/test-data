Upon a Change of Control Event occurring, each Bondholder shall have a right of pre-payment (Put Option) of the Bonds at a price of 101% of par value (plus accrued interest) during a period of 60 days following the notice of a Change of Control Event.
Change of Control Event means any person or group (as such term is defined in the Norwegian Limited Liability Companies Act § 1-3) becomes the owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50.0% of the outstanding shares of the Parent, save for any of the shareholders of the Parent existing at the date of this Term Sheet.
Upon a Mandatory Prepayment Event occurring, the Issuer shall not later than 30 days following the relevant Mandatory Prepayment Event (unless there is an Event of Default in which case it will be promptly), redeem (a) 100% of the outstanding Bonds if related to all Rigs or (b) if related to 1 or more Rigs, 30% of the outstanding Bonds for each Rig, in all instances at a price according to the Call Options.
For the avoidance of doubt, the aforesaid redemption prices shall be determined based on the date the Mandatory Prepayment Event occurred and not based on the date of repayment.
If the Bonds are redeemed according to this Mandatory Prepayment provision, the relevant amount on the Escrow Account, the relevant Rig Owner Earnings Account and the Issuer Debt Service Account or any of the insurance proceeds may be used as part payment in relation to the Mandatory Prepayment.
Upon the occurrence of several Mandatory Prepayment Events, the Issuer shall only be obliged to pay one redemption amount.
