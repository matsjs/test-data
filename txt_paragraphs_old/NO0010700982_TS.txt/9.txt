Call Options:
Save for the Equity Clawback as described below, the Issuer may redeem the Bonds in whole but not in part at any time from and including:
(i)
the Settlement Date to, but not including, the date falling 24
months after Settlement Date at a price equivalent to the sum of:
a) the present value on the relevant record date of 104.50% of par value as if such payment originally should have taken place on the Interest Payment Date falling 24 months after the Settlement Date; and
b) the present value on the relevant record date of the remaining coupon payments (less any accrued but unpaid interest) through and including the date falling 24 months after Settlement Date,
both calculated by using a discount rate of 50 basis points over the comparable U.S. Treasury Rate (i.e. comparable to the remaining duration of the Bonds until the mentioned date falling 24 months after Settlement Date) (plus accrued interest on redeemed amount) and where "relevant record date" shall mean a date agreed upon between the Trustee, the Paying Agent, VPS and the Issuer in connection with such repayment;
(ii) the date falling 24 months after the Settlement Date to, but not including, the date falling 36 months after the Settlement Date at a price equal to104.50% of par value (plus accrued interest on the redeemed amount);
