Escrow Account
(a) The Issuer shall prior to the Issue Date, establish a pledged and blocked escrow account (with a bank acceptable to the Bond Trustee), (the "Escrow Account"). Once all Issue Date Conditions Precedent (as set out in Clause 6) have been satisfied, the proceeds from the Bond Issue shall be transferred to the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account shall be pledged on first priority in favour of the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) under the Escrow Account Pledge, and blocked in such way that no withdrawals can be made therefrom without the Bond Trustee's written consent.
(b) The funds in the Escrow Account shall only be used by the Issuer (i) according to the Purpose of the Bond Issue as described above or, alternatively, (ii) in the event that the Disbursement Conditions Precedent (as set out in Clause 6) are not satisfied for any reason before the first Interest Payment Day, in connection with repayment of the entire bond issue at (i) par value if such failure to comply with the Disbursement Conditions Precedent is beyond the control of the Issuer and (ii) otherwise at 101% of par value. The funds shall be returned to the bondholders if the Disbursement Conditions Precedents are not fulfilled or waived on or prior to the first Interest Payment Day.
