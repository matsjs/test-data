the amount of the payment due from the Issuer shall be increased to such amount
(after making the required withholding) equal to the payment which would have
been due if no withholding had been required; and
(b)
the Issuer shall at the request of the Bond Trustee deliver to the Bond Trustee
evidence that the required tax reduction or withholding has been made.
14.7 If any withholding tax is imposed due to subsequent changes in applicable law after the date of this Bond Agreement, the Issuer shall have the right to call all but not some of the Bonds at par value plus accrued interest. Such call shall be notified by the Issuer in writing to the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the settlement date of the call.
14.8 In the event that the Issuer does not pay the Bond Trustee for any fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Bond Trustee that fall within the scope of this Clause 14 (the "Trustee Expenses"), the Bond Trustee shall be entitled to seek funding of the Trustee Expenses from other sources. If and to the extent that other sources provide funding for the Trustee Expenses, those other sources shall be subrogated into the position of the Bond Trustee for the purposes of Clause 11.6, but subordinated to any further Trustee Expenses.
