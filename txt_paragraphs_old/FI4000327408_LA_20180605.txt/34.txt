REDEMPTION AND REPURCHASE OF THE NOTES
8.1
Redemption at maturity
The Issuer shall redeem all of the outstanding Notes in full on the Final Maturity Date with an amount per Note equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest. If the Final Maturity Date is not a CSD Business Day, then the redemption shall occur on the CSD Business Day determined by application of the Business Day Convention.
8.2
Issuer's purchase of Notes
The Issuer may at any time and at any price purchase any Notes on the market or in any other way, provided that if purchases are made through a tender offer, the possibility to tender must be made available to all Noteholders on equal terms provided, however, that if as a result of purchases made otherwise than by way of a tender offer (whether in a single transaction or a series of transactions) the Issuer (or a Group Company) holds Notes in an amount exceeding ten (10) per cent. of the aggregate Nominal Amount, such purchases and any subsequent purchases must be made through a tender offer to all Noteholders alike. The Notes held by the Issuer may at the Issuer's discretion be retained, sold or cancelled by the Issuer.
