If quorum exists for some but not all of the matter to be dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting or by a Written Procedure, decisions may be taken in the matter for which a quorum exists.
If a quorum does not exist at a Noteholders' Meeting or in respect of a Written Procedure, the Agent or the Issuer shall convene a second Noteholders' Meeting (in accordance with Clause 16.1) or initiate a second Written Procedure (in accordance with Clause 17.1), as the case may be, provided that the person(s) who initiated the procedure for Noteholders' consent has confirmed that the relevant proposal has not been withdrawn. For the purposes of a second Noteholders' Meeting or second Written Procedure pursuant to this Clause 15.10, the date of request of the second Noteholders' Meeting pursuant to Clause 16.1 or second Written Procedure pursuant to Clause 17.1, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the relevant date when the quorum did not exist. The quorum requirement in Clause 15.9 shall not apply to such second Noteholders' Meeting or Written Procedure.
