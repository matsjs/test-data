12.10 Acceleration of the Bonds
(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions in these Terms and Conditions, acceleration of the Bonds on the grounds mentioned in Clause 12.2 (Other Obligations) above or, regarding any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries, on the grounds mentioned in Clauses 12.4 (Insolvency) to and including Clause 12.9 (Continuation of the Business), above may only occur if the nature of the particular circumstance is such that it would have a Material Adverse Effect and that the cause of termination is continuing at the time of the Agent's declaration of acceleration. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned under Clause 12.4 (Insolvency) above.
(c) If the Bondholders instruct the Agent to accelerate the Bonds, the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds due and payable and take such actions as, in the opinion of the Agent, may be necessary or desirable to enforce the rights of the Bondholders under the Finance Documents, unless the relevant Event of Default is no longer continuing.
(d) If the right to accelerate the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the period of appeal has expired in order for cause of acceleration to be deemed to exist.
