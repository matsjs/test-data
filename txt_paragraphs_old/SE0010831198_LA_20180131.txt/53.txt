DECISIONS BY BONDHOLDERS
Any request from the Issuer or a Bondholder (or Bondholders) representing at least ten (10) per cent, of the Adjusted Nominal Amount (such request may only be validly made by a person who is a Bondholder on the Business Day immediately following the day on which the request is received by the Agent and shall, if made by several Bondholders, be made by them jointly) for a decision by the Bondholders on a matter relating to the Finance Documents shall be directed to the Agent and dealt with at a Bondholders Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure, as determined by the Agent. The person requesting the decision may suggest the form for decision making, but if it is in the Agent's opinion more appropriate that a matter is dealt with at a Bondholders Meeting than by way of a Written Procedure, it shall be dealt with at a Bondholders Meeting.

The Agent may refrain from convening a Bondholders' Meeting or instigating a Written Procedure if (i) the suggested decision must be approved by any person in addition to the Bondholders and such person has informed the Agent that an approval will not be given, or (ii) the suggested decision is not in accordance with applicable laws.
Only a person who is, or who has been provided with a power of attorney pursuant to Clause 6 (Right to act on behalf of a Bondholder) from a person who is, registered as a Bondholder:
(a) on the Record Date prior to the date of the Bondholders' Meeting, in respect of a Bondholders' Meeting, or
(b) on the Business Day specified in the communication pursuant to Clause 17.3, in respect of a Written Procedure,
may exercise voting rights as a Bondholder at such Bondholders' Meeting or in such Written Procedure, provided that the relevant Bonds are included in the definition of Adjusted Nominal Amount.
