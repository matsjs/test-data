(iii) the pro forma calculation of EBITDA shall be adjusted to take into account the net cost savings and other reasonable synergies, as the case may be, realisable by the Group during the Reference Period as a result of acquisitions and/or disposals of entities referred to in (i) or (ii) above, provided that such net cost savings and other reasonable synergies, as the case may be, have been confirmed by a reputable accounting firm and the Issuer has provided evidence thereof to the Agent, but only insofar as such would not result in more than a 5.00 per cent. variation of the total EBITDA compared to if the extraordinary or exceptional items (as applicable) would be taken into account, provided that any such synergies taken into account shall be specified in the quarterly reports of the Group and in each Compliance Certificate.
(d) The figures for Net Interest Bearing Debt set out in the financial statements as of the most recent quarter date (including when necessary, financial statements published before the First Issue Date), shall be used, but adjusted so that Net Interest Bearing Debt for such period shall be:
(i) reduced to reflect any Net Interest Bearing Debt attributable to a disposed entity or which has been repaid, repurchased or otherwise discharged as a result of or in connection with a disposal of an entity (to the extent such Net Interest Bearing Debt is included in the relevant financial statements);
(ii) increased on a pro forma basis by an amount equal to the Net Interest Bearing Debt directly attributable to (i) any Financial Indebtedness owed by acquired entities, and (ii) any Financial Indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of entities, in each case calculated as if all such debt had been incurred at the beginning of the relevant test period; and
(iii) increased on a pro forma basis by an amount equal to the Net Interest Bearing Debt directly attributable to any Financial Indebtedness incurred under any Subsequent Bonds, calculated as if such debt had been incurred at the beginning of the relevant Reference Period.
