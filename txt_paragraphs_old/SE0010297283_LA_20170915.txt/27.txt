The Issuer may, on one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Notes. The Issuer may, at one or several occasions after the First Issue Date, issue Subsequent Notes (each such issue, a "Subsequent Note Issue"), so long as the Total Nominal Amount under such Subsequent Note Issue(s) and the Initial Note Issue does not exceed SEK 500,000,000 and in each case provided that the Incurrence Test (tested pro forma including such Subsequent Note Issue) is met. Subsequent Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate, the currency, the nominal amount and the final maturity applicable to the Initial Notes shall apply to Subsequent Notes. The issue price of the Subsequent Notes may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal Amount.
Upon a transfer of Notes, all rights and obligations under these Terms and Conditions and the other Finance Documents in relation to such Notes are automatically transferred to the transferee.
The Notes are freely transferable but the Noteholders may be subject to purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Notes, as applicable, under local laws to which a Noteholder may be subject. Each Noteholder must ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.
No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction other than Sweden, where action for that purpose is required. Each Noteholder must inform itself about, and observe, any applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Notes.
