b) as soon as the same become available, but in any event within two months after the end of each quarter of its financial year, its quarterly unaudited consolidated financial statements or the year-end report (bokslutskommunike) (as applicable) for such period prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles; and
c) any other information required by the Swedish Securities Markets Act (lagen (2007:582) om vardepappersmarknaden) and the rules and regulations of the Regulated Market on which the Notes are admitted to trading.
The Issuer shall in each quarterly report delivered, disclose the amount of Notes cancelled or issued by the Issuer during the financial quarter pertaining to such report, provided that no such information shall be necessary if no Notes have been cancelled or issued during the relevant financial quarter.
The Issuer shall immediately notify the Noteholders and the Agent upon becoming aware of the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, Listing Failure or De-Listing Event, and shall provide the Agent with such further information as the Agent may request (acting reasonably) following receipt of such notice.
The Issuer shall immediately notify the Agent upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any event or circumstance which constitutes an Event of Default, or any event or circumstance which would (with the expiry of a grace period, the giving of notice, the making of any determination or any combination of the foregoing) constitute an Event of Default, and shall provide the Agent with such further information as it may reasonably request in writing following receipt of such notice. Should the Agent not receive such information, the Agent is entitled to assume that no such event or circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Agent does not have actual knowledge of such event or circumstance.

If such conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with the Regulated Market or otherwise, the Issuer shall be obliged to either seek approval from the Regulated Market or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non disclosure agreement with the Agent, in order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to this Clause 10.1.
