8. STATUS OF THE BONDS AND SECURITY
8.1 Ranking and priority
8.1.1 The Bonds shall be senior debt of the Issuer, secured on first priority in certain assets of the Issuer, the Owning Company and the Bareboat Charterer (if party to a Charter) as set out herein, and otherwise rank at least pari passu with all the claims of the Issuer's other unsubordinated creditors, except for the obligations which are mandatorily preferred by law.
8.1.2 The Issuer shall ensure that the Security Documents are duly executed by the Issuer, the Owning Company, the Bareboat Charterer (if applicable) and any other security provider in favour of the Bond Trustee (on behalf of it self and the Bondholders) and that the Security Documents are legally valid, perfected, enforceable and in full force and effect. The Issuer shall execute and procure the execution of such further documentation as the Bond Trustee may reasonably require in order for the Bondholders to at all times maintain the security position envisaged hereunder (subject only to any restrictions imposed by mandatory law and it being understood that customary limitation language will be included if so required).
