11.5 If the right to termination is based upon a decision of a court of law, a government authority or an annual general meeting, it is not necessary that the decision has acquired legal force or that the period of appeal has expired in order for cause of termination to be deemed to exist.
11.7 The Company is only obliged to inform the Agent according to Section 11.6 if informing the Agent would not conflict with any statute or, when the Bonds are listed, the Company's registration contract with OMX.
11.8 If the Agent has been notified by the Company or has otherwise determined that there is a default under these Terms and Conditions according to Section 11.1, the Agent shall decide, within ten (10) Banking Days of the day of noti fication or determination, if the Bonds shall be declared terminated. If the Agent has decided not to terminate the Bonds or if ground for termination according to Section 11.1 (e) is at hand, the Agent shall, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that right to termination is at hand and obtain judgement on the matter from the Holders according to the provisions in Section 12. If the Holders decide for termination to occur, the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. If the cause for termination according to the Agent's appraisal has ceased before the termination, the Agent shall not be obliged to terminate the Bonds. The Agent shall in such case, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that the cause for termination has ceased. If the Holders, without prior initiative to decision from the Agent or the Company, have made a decision regarding termination in accordance with Section 12, the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. The Agent is however not liable to take action if the Agent considers cause for termination not to be at hand, unless the instructing Holders in writing commit to holding the Agent indemnified and, at the Agent's own discretion, grant sufficient security for the obligation.
