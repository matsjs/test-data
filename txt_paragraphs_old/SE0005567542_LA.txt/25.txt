No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public
offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other
material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden, where action for that purpose is required. Each Bondholder must inform itself about, and observe,
any applicable restrictions to the transfer or purchase of the Bonds or transfer of material
relating to the Issuer or the Bonds (due to, e.g., its nationality, its residency, its registered
address or its place(s) o f business). Each Bondholder must ensure compliance with such
restrictions at its own cost and expense.
