5.1 The Bonds will be issued in accordance with the Financial Instruments Accounts Act in electronic book-entry form and will be registered on behalf of the Holders on a Securities Account. No physical notes will be issued. Registration requests relating to the Bonds shall be directed to an Account Operator. Those who, according to assignment, pledge, the provisions of the Swedish Children and Parents Code (Sw.

6 Payments of principal and interest
6.1 Payment of the Nominal Amount and/or interest will be made to the person who is a Holder on the Record Date immediately preceding the relevant payment date.
6.2 If a Holder has registered, through an Account Operator, that capital and interest shall be paid to a designated bank account, such payment will, subject to Section 6.3, be effected by the CSD on the relevant payment date. In other cases, payments will be transferred by the CSD to the Holder at the address registered with the CSD on the Record Date.
6.3 If a day on which an amount becomes due and payable is not a Banking Day, the amount will be deposited or transferred the next following Banking Day, unless such Banking Day falls in the subsequent calendar month, in which case the payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Banking Day (modified following Banking Day convention).
6.4 Should the CSD, due to a delay on behalf of the Company or some other obstacle, not be able to effect the payment of any amounts according to this Section 6, the CSD will pay such amount to the Holders as soon as possible

after such obstacle has been removed. For the avoidance of doubt, payment will be made to the person registered as Holder on the Record Date immediately preceding the actual payment date.
6.5 If a person to whom payment has been made in accordance with the above was not entitled to receive such payment, the Company and the CSD shall nevertheless be deemed to have fulfilled their obligations, provided that the Company and/or the CSD did not have knowledge that such payment was made to a person not entitled to receive such amount and provided that the Company and/or the CSD acted with normal care.
