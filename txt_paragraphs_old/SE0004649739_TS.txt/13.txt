Risks Related to the Bond Issue
1.2.1 Liquidity Risks
The Company cannot guarantee that a liquid trading in the Bonds occur and is maintained. The company will apply for registration of the Bonds at the Corporate Bond List at OMX.

Even though a security is admitted for trading on a regulated market, there may not always be a demand for, and trade with, that security. This can result in that a bondholder may be unable to sell its Bonds at a desired time or to a return which is comparable to similar investments which have an existing and functioning secondary market. Lack of liquidity in the market may adversely affect the market value of the Bonds.
1.2.2 Credit Risk
Investors in the Bonds have a credit risk in relation to the Company. An investor's opportunity to obtain payment under the Terms and Conditions is therefore dependent on the Company's ability to meet its payment obligations. The Company's ability to meet its payment obligations is in turn, to a large extent, dependent on the development of the Company's operations and financial position. The Company's financial position is affected by a number of risk factors, of which some have been described above. An increase in credit risk may cause the market to price the Bonds with a higher risk premium, which could adversely affect the Bonds' value.
Another aspect of the credit risk is that a decreased financial position may lead to a decrease in the Company's credit rating which may lead to a decrease in the Company's possibilities to finance itself through loans around the time of maturity of the Bonds. The credit risk should ultimately be considered with respect to the market value of the real estate portfolio in the event of a sale. The Company's ambition is that its collective debts shall not exceed 70 per cent. of the book value of the Company's real estate.
