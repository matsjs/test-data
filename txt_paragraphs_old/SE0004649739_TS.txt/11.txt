1.1.15 Environmental Risks
Real estate management has environmental impact. The Company has established an environmental policy and is actively working with environmental issues.
Everyone whose operations have contributory caused pollution is responsible for after-treatment according to the Swedish Environmental Code.

This means that demands of soil decontamination or after-treatment, due to existing or suspected soil, surface water or ground water pollution in certain circumstances may be directed against the Company in order to set the real estate in such condition that is required by the Swedish Environmental Code. Such demands may adversely affect the Company's business and result. The Company has not performed a complete investigation regarding possible environmental pollution amongst the real estate portfolio.
