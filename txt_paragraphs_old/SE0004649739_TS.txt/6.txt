1.1.1 Macroeconomic Factors
The real estate business is extensively affected by macroeconomic factors such as the general economic trend, growth, employment, the rate of production of new premises, changes in infrastructure, population growth, inflation and interest rates. The economic growth affects the employment rate which is a factor for the supply and demand on the real estate rental market. In turn this affects the vacancy ratio and rents, especially in terms of commercial real estate.
Expectations regarding the inflation affect the interest rate and therefore affect the Company's net of financial items. The interest cost for debt to financial institutions is one of the Company's main costs items. Changes in interest rate have a significant effect on the Company's long-term result and cash flow. Inflation also affects the Company's costs. In addition, changes in interest rate and inflation also affect the yield requirements and thus the market value of the real estate.
A higher vacancy ratio and interest rates, increased costs and lower rents could have a material adverse effect the Company's business, financial position and result.
1.1.2 Geographical Risks
The supply and demand for real estates and the return on real estate investments differs between different geographical markets and may develop differently within different geographical markets.

The Company has a well-diversified real estate portfolio, with its real estate located in different geographical markets. However, there is no guarantee that the demand does not decline on most, or all, of these markets, which could adversely affect the Company's result and financial positions.
