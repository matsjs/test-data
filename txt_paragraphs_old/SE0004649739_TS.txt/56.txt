13.2 If the Bonds are declared due and payable, the Company shall redeem the Bonds at a redemption price equal to the Bonds' Nominal Amount plus the accrued interest, if any, pursuant to Section 9 from but excluding the preceding Interest Payment Date (or, if such date has not occurred, the Issue Date), up to and including the payment date.
13.3 Termination for payment prematurely on the grounds mentioned in Sections 13.1 (b) above or, regarding any of the Company's Subsidiaries, on the grounds mentioned in Section 13.1 (c), (d), (e) (f) and (g) above may only occur if the nature of the particular circumstance would have a Material Adverse Effect and the cause of termination is continuing at the time of the Bond Trustee's declaration.

13.5 The Company is obliged to inform the Bond Trustee immediately if any circumstance specified in Section 13.1 should occur.

The Company shall further, at the request of the Bond Trustee, provide the Bond Trustee with details of any circumstances referred to in Section 13.1 and all documents that may be of significance for the application of this Section 13.
