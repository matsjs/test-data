Clause 20.1 shall not apply if the Agent has been instructed by the Holders in accordance with these Terms and Conditions to take certain actions but fails for any reason to take, or is unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a Holder to provide documents in accordance with Clause 18.1.2), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under these Terms and Conditions or the Agency Agreement or by any reason described in Clause 18.2.9, such failure must continue for at least forty (40) Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 18.2.10 before a Holder may take any action referred to in Clause 20.1.
The provisions of Clause 20.1 shall not in any way limit an individual Holder's right to claim and enforce payments which are due to it under Clause 10.4 (Mandatory repurchase due
to a Change of Control Event, a De-listing Event or Listing Failure (put option)) or other
payments which are due by the Issuer to some but not all Holders.
