Disposals of assets
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of the Subsidiaries will, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares in any Material Group Company or of all or substantially all of its or any Material Group Company's assets or operations to any Person not being the Issuer or any of the wholly-owned Subsidiaries, unless the transaction (taken as a whole also taking into account any transaction ancillary or related thereto) is carried out at arm's length terms and on terms and conditions customary for such transaction and provided that it does not have a Material Adverse Effect.
