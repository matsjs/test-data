8.2 The Bonds, including accrued but unpaid interest and expenses, shall be secured by the Security Interests.
8.3 The Bond Trustee shall be authorized to agree and execute a "Letter of Quiet Enjoyment" if required by the Client under a Drilling Contract provided that the income under the Drilling Contract, together with amounts on the Issuer Retention Account, will be sufficient to service interests and installments on the Loan falling due during the term of the Letter of Quiet Enjoyment, and then in such form as and content reasonably requested by the Client. If such letter is required, then the Issuer shall use its best efforts to obtain step-in rights for the Bond Trustee (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will be in addition to any other rights assigned pursuant to the Drilling Contract Assignment) in respect of the relevant Drilling Contract.
