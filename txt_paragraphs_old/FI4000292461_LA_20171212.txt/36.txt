(ii) 4.25:1 from (but excluding) the first anniversary of the First Issue Date until (and including) the second anniversary of the First Issue Date;
(b) no Event of Default is continuing or would occur upon the incurrence or the payment (as applicable).
12.2 Testing of the Incurrence Test
The calculation of the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no more than two months prior to the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness or the making of a Restricted Payment, as applicable. The Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date so determined, but (in relation to the incurrence of Permitted Debt) include the new Financial Indebtedness provided it is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt). EBITDA shall be calculated in accordance with Clause 12.3 (Adjustments).

(a) entities acquired or disposed of by the Group during the Reference Period, or after the end of the Reference Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be included or excluded (as applicable), pro forma, for the entire Reference Period; and
(b) any entity to be acquired with the proceeds from new Financial Indebtedness shall be included, pro forma, for the entire Reference Period.
