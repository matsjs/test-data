STATUS OF THE NOTES
By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder agrees that the Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Notes, each subsequent Noteholder confirms such agreement.
The nominal amount of each Note is SEK 1,000,000 (the "Nominal Amount"). All Initial Notes are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 100 per cent. of the Nominal Amount. The total nominal amount of the Initial Notes is SEK 850,000,000.
The Issuer may, at one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Notes, provided that (i) no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue, and (ii) the Loan to Value covenant will not be breached as a result of such subsequent issue. Subsequent Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate, the Nominal Amount and the final maturity applicable to the Initial Notes shall apply to Subsequent Notes. The price of the Subsequent Notes may be set at the Nominal Amount, at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal Amount. The maximum total nominal amount o fthe Notes (the Initial Notes and all Subsequent Notes) may not exceed SEK 1,250,000,000 unless consent from the Noteholders is obtained in accordance with Clause 14.5. Each Subsequent Note shall entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with Clause 8.1, and otherwise have the same rights as the Initial Notes.
The Notes constitute direct, unconditional and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu with all other direct, unconditional and unsecured obligations o f the Issuer and without any preference among them.
The Notes are freely transferable but the Noteholders may be subject to purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Notes, as applicable, under local laws to which a

Noteholder may be subject. Each Noteholder must ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.
