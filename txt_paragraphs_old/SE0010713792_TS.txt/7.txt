Trustee as security agent:
The Trustee will hold the Transaction Security, acting as security agent on behalf of the Bondholders in accordance with the Security Documents.
Unless and until the Trustee has received instructions from the Bondholders to the contrary, the Trustee shall (without first having to obtain the Bondholders' consent), be entitled to enter into agreements with the Issuer or a third party or take any other actions, if it is, in the Trustee's opinion, necessary for the purpose of maintaining, releasing or enforcing the Transaction Security or for the purpose of settling the Bondholders' or the Issuer's rights to the Transaction Security, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents and the Terms and Conditions.
(a) When the Issuer and/or a Condominium Association have presented a binding commitment from a financier to provide a Construction Facility for the purpose of completing any part of the Sandsberg Projects, the Issuer may request and the Trustee may, in its sole discretion, approve that the Sandsberg Mortgage is released in order to secure such Construction Facility instead.
(b) When the different stages of the Sandsberg Projects have been completed and sold, all Transaction Security provided in respect of that stage of the Sandsberg Projects shall be released by the Trustee, provided that the Issuer shall ensure that all disposal proceeds from the disposal of the apartments within that stage of the Sandsberg Projects (net of reasonable transactions costs) have been deposited on the Blocked Account.
(c) Any disposal proceeds from the Sandsberg Projects deposited on the Blocked Account shall thereafter constitute Development Funds and may be applied towards completion of the other stages of the Projects.
