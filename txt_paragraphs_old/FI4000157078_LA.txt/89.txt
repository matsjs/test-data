Clause 19.1 shall not apply if:
(a) the Agent has been instructed by the Noteholders in accordance with the Finance Documents to take any of the actions referred to in Clause 19.1 but fails for any reason to take, or is unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a Noteholder to provide documents in accordance with Clause 18.1.2), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such failure or inability is continuing.
