(i) sell or dispose of all or a substantial part of its assets or operations, (ii) change the nature of its business, or (iii) merge, demerge or in any other way restructure its business,
(c) not permit any member of the Group to engage in, directly or indirectly, any transaction with any party, except in the ordinary course of such member of the Group's business and upon fair and reasonable terms that are no less favourable to the member of the Group than those which might be obtained in an arm's length transaction at the time,
(d) not create or permit to create any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien or any other form of encumbrance (including, but not limited to financial leases) upon any present or future assets of the Borrower or grant any guarantee or indemnity. Notwithstanding the aforesaid the Borrower has the right to:
(i) permit to subsist customary pledges granted in connection with ordinary trading in securities and financial instruments,
(ii) provide customary collateral in connection with credit purchases of goods and services, and
(iii) subsist security pledges on assets of companies merged with the Borrower (where the Borrower is the acquiring party) given that collateral is not established as part of the merger, and that the obligation secured by the collateral is not extended in any way either as part of the merger proceedings or later.
For the avoidance of doubt, the aforesaid restriction shall only apply for the Borrower, not for other companies within the Group. Further, it is understood that the Borrower's ownership interest in Venture Drilling AS, Petrojack ASA and PetroMena ASA shall be hold directly by the Borrower and that the Borrower may not by-pass the aforesaid restriction in this clause 13.2 (d) by transferring its assets (existing or future) to wholly owned holding companies.
(e) not grant any loans, guarantees or other financial assistance to any third party not being a member of the Group, unless provided for above,
