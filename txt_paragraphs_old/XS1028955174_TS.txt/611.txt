The useful lives are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and, if they differ significantly from previous estimates, the depreciation periods are adjusted accordingly.
Depreciation begins when the asset is available for use (i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management) and continues until the asset is fully depreciated or derecognized.
An asset is removed from the balance sheet on disposal or when it is withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from it. The gain or loss on disposal is the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount, and is recognized in the statement of income in other operating income and expenses. Gains are classified as other operating income.
Government grants
Government Grants are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all conditions attached.
Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the asset. The depreciation is calculated based on the adjusted carrying value of the asset. Thus government grants are recognized as income during the assets useful life in the form of reduced depreciation charges.
Other government grants are recognized on a systematic basis as income over the periods necessary to match them with the costs for which they are intended to compensate. Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred, or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs, are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.
