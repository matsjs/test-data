provided, however, that if such amendment or waiver described in clauses (2), (3) and (4) above only affects or would only affect the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes, and does not or would not affect Holders of the Notes generally, only the consent of the Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes (and not the consent of the Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of all Notes then outstanding), as the case may be, shall be required. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that (a) any matter described in clauses (2), (3) and (4) above that by its terms applies only to the Fixed Rate Notes shall require the consent of the Holders of not less than 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Fixed Rate Notes in order for it to be binding on all Holders of the Fixed Rate Notes and (b) any matter described in clauses (2), (3) and (4) above that by its terms applies only to the Floating Rate Notes shall require the consent of the Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Floating Rate Notes in order for it to be binding on all Holders of the Floating Rate Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:
(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;
(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary under any Notes Document;
(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;
(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect under the Notes Documents;
(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the instructions set forth in the Indenture on the Issue Date;
(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the covenant described under "--C e rta in C o v e n a n ts -- L im ita tio n o n I n d e b te d n e s s " or "--A d d it io n a l G u a r a n te e s ,'' to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to, or for the benefit of, the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
