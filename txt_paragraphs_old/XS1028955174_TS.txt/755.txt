Applied principles for sensitivity analysis
The impact from 1% increase in interest rate for financing cost within the next 12 months if the change had occurred at statement of financial position date. The sensitivity analysis includes interest bearing liabilities of the Group, where the re-pricing period is within the next 12 months. The sensitivity analysis has been calculated with same principles for the financial receivables of the Group. Loan interests have been hedged with interest instruments; therefore increase in market interest rates does not have an impact on interest expenses. The fluctuation of market value of the interest rate hedges is shown in other comprehensive income. The effect of a 1% increase in interest would increase the value of the interest rate hedge instruments by about 3.5 million.
