Further security and incremental borrowings
The Intercreditor Agreement will contemplate the Debtors (or any of them): (i) incurring incremental borrowing liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities under, or (ii) refinancing the borrowing liabilities incurred under, the documents creating or evidencing indebtedness under or in respect of any Credit Facility, the Notes, the Hedging Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt, the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities or the Subordinated Liabilities (such documents or instruments, together with the Transaction Security, being
179
referred to collectively as the "Debt Documents") and/or incurring guarantees in respect of any indebtedness incurred in connection with any such refinancing (such incremental borrowing liabilities, refinancing liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities being referred to as ``Additional Indebtedness") which in any such case are intended to rank pari passu with and/or share pari passu in any Transaction Security with any existing liabilities and/or to rank behind any existing liabilities and/or to share in the Transaction Security behind such existing liabilities. The Secured Parties and the creditors in respect of the Subordinated Liabilities (the ``Subordinated Creditors") (each a "Creditor" and collectively, the "Creditors") will confirm in the Intercreditor Agreement that, provided such financing or refinancing and such ranking and such security is permitted and not prohibited under the terms of the Debt Documents, they will (at the Debtors' cost) enter into such documentation as may be necessary (including entering into a new intercreditor agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement) to ensure that the Additional Indebtedness (and the liabilities and obligations of the Debtors in respect of such Additional Indebtedness) will have the ranking permitted to be conferred upon it in accordance with the terms of the Debt Documents, provided that such documentation does not in any significant respect adversely affect the interests of any of the Secured Parties.
Permitted payments
The Intercreditor Agreement will permit, inter alia, payments to be made by the Debtors under the Credit Facility Documents, the Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents and the Senior Unsecured Notes Documents in each case in accordance with the terms of the relevant Credit Facility Document, Notes Document, Pari Passu Debt Document or Senior Unsecured Notes Document, but subject to: (i) in the case of payments in respect of the Notes, compliance with, amongst others, the Notes Purchase condition described under ``--New Revolving Credit Facility--Note Purchase c o n d itio n (ii) in the case of payments in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities, amongst others, any restrictions under the Credit Facility Documents, the Notes Documents, any existing Pari Passu Debt Documents and any Senior Unsecured Debt Documents; and (iii) in the case of payments in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities, amongst others, any restrictions under Credit Facility Documents or the Notes Documents. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that following the occurrence of an acceleration event in respect of Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the Pari Passu Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities or the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities (an ``Acceleration Event"), no member of the Issuer Group will be permitted to make payments under the Credit Facility Documents, the Notes Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents except from the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or as agreed by all Creditor Representatives (as defined below). The foregoing restrictions will not apply to payments to a Creditor Representative in respect of its Creditor Representative Amounts (as defined below).
The Intercreditor Agreement will also permit payments to be made from time to time when due to lenders owed any Intra Group Liabilities (``Intra Group Liabilities Payments") if at the time of payment no Acceleration Event has occurred and is continuing. The Intercreditor Agreement will permit Intra Group Liabilities Payments if an Acceleration Event has occurred: (i) prior to the date on which the Super Senior Liabilities are discharged in full (the ``Super Senior Discharge Date"), with the consent of the Senior Secured Instructing Group (as defined, and further described, in ``--Manner of enforcement" below); (ii) after the Super Senior Discharge Date but prior to the date on which the Senior Secured Liabilities are discharged in full (the ``Senior Secured Discharge Date"), to the extent prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes Documents, the Hedging Agreements or any of the Pari Passu Debt Documents, with the consent of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as defined below) (acting through their Creditor Representatives); (iii) after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but prior to the date on which the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities are discharged (the ``Senior Unsecured Notes Discharge Date"), to the extent prohibited under the Senior Unsecured Notes Documents with the consent of the Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders (as defined below) (acting through their Creditor Representatives); or (iv) if that payment is made to facilitate payment of the Super Senior Liabilities and/or Senior Secured Liabilities and/or Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities.
Payments may be made on Shareholder Liabilities from time to time when due if: (i) the payment is not prohibited by the Credit Facility Documents, the Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents or the Senior Unsecured Notes Debt Documents; (ii) the payment is to fund a payment under the Senior Unsecured Notes which is permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement; (iii) prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Instructing Group gives written consent to such payment being made; (iv) on or after the Super Senior Discharge Date but prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (acting through their Creditor Representative (as defined below)) give written consent to such payment being made; or (v) after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but prior to the Senior Unsecured Notes Discharge Date, the Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders (acting through their Creditor Representative) give written consent to such payment being made.
