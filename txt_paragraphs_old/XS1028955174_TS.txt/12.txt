NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS
European Economic Area
This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that this Offering will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive as implemented in member states of the European Economic Area ("EEA") from the requirement to produce and publish a prospectus which is compliant with the Prospectus Directive, as so implemented, for offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA or any of its member states which have implemented the Prospectus Directive (each a "Relevant Member State") of the Notes which are the subject of the placement referred to in this offering memorandum must only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer, any of the Initial Purchasers or the Adviser to produce and publish a prospectus which is compliant with the Prospectus Directive, including Article 3 thereof, as so implemented for such offer. For EEA jurisdictions that have not implemented the Prospectus Directive, all offers of the Notes must be in compliance with the laws of such jurisdictions. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Adviser have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute a final placement of the Notes.
In relation to each Relevant Member State, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the "Relevant Implementation Date") it has not made and will not make an offer of the Notes which are the subject of the Offering contemplated by this offering memorandum to the public in that Relevant Member State other than:
(i) to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive;
(ii) to fewer than 100 natural or legal persons or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the relevant provision of the 2010 PD Amending Directive, 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive subject to obtaining the prior consent of the relevant Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers nominated by the Issuer for any such offer; or
(iii) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive;
