(1) We define EBITDA as profit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations before income tax expense, finance income and costs, depreciation and amortization and impairments.
EBITDA is not a uniformly or legally defined financial measure and is not a measurement of performance under IFRS, and you should not consider EBITDA as an alternative to (a) operating profit or profit for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance or liquidity under IFRS. We believe that EBITDA is a useful indicator of our ability to incur and service our indebtedness and can assist investors to evaluate our results of operations. EBITDA and similar measures are used by different companies for differing purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies. You should exercise caution in comparing EBITDA as reported by us to EBITDA of other companies. See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information--Non-IFRS Measures."
