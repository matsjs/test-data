For so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver in Ireland in a daily newspaper
with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish T im e s). Such notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver may instead be published on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange (w w w .is e .ie ).
Additional or Amended Intercreditor Agreements
The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (x) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``--L im ita tio n o n In d e b te d n e s s '' or clause (1), (4), (5), (6), (7) (other than with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations), (11) or (13) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "--L im ita tio n o n I n d e b te d n e s s '' and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an `Additional Intercreditor Agreement'') or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; p r o v id e d that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. Only one such Intercreditor Agreement shall be outstanding at any one time or, if more than one such Intercreditor Agreement is outstanding at any one time, the collective terms of such Intercreditor Agreements must not conflict and must be no more disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes than if all such Indebtedness was a party to one such agreement.
The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under ``--A m e n d m e n ts a n d W a ivers," and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; p r o v id e d , h o w e v e r, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under ``--L im ita tio n o n R e str ic te d P a y m e n ts ."
The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
236
Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices or at the offices of the listing agent.
