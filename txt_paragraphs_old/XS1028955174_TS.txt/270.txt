The implementation of European Directive 2010/75/EC on industrial emissions (``IED Directive") in 2014 will put more focus on soil contamination monitoring and remediation levels in connection with
environmental permits. Operators will be required to complete a baseline report regarding the condition of soil and groundwater at the facility site that includes handling of relevant hazardous substances. The baseline report must be submitted to the permit authority as part of the permit application in connection with the review of an environmental permit or before new operations are initiated. This obligation is with respect to activities to which the IED applies. Lappeenranta, which will shut down operations in 2016, is required to conduct a baseline report on soil contamination by the end of October 2015, based on its current environmental permit obligations.
Some Finnish environmental laws and regulations may impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners or operators of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities or sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Our historical and current operations involve the use of hazardous substances and we operate or have operated production plants that are or have been located on sites with a long history of industrial use by third parties. Such previous activities have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination at some of our current and former sites or land adjacent to such sites. In some cases, we are responsible for further investigations, remediation and clean up actions, even though we may not have caused the contamination. Although we believe that we are generally in compliance with our legal obligations at our Finnish sites, soil and/or groundwater contamination has been detected at some of the sites (including Oulu and Parainen) and additional contamination of soil and groundwater may be discovered at these or other sites in the future, including in connection with the baseline studies described above. Such discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new obligations to investigate or remediate soil or groundwater contamination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Moreover, regulatory authorities could suspend our operations or refuse to renew the permits and authorizations we require to operate. They could also mandate upgrades or changes to our processes that could result in significant costs to us. We anticipate that the countries where we do business will continue to develop increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and to interpret and enforce existing laws and regulations more aggressively. This trend could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Emissions and Environmental Permits
Laws and regulations governing the emission of air pollutants, noise, odors and vibrations subject our industrial facilities to permitting and other compliance obligations. In some cases, a continuous improvement or retrofitting of installations to maintain facilities at "state of the art" safety standards may be required. Compliance with these requirements is monitored by local authorities and operators may be required to submit emission reports on a regular basis. Non-compliance with maximum emission levels may result in administrative fines, other administrative compulsion or, in Finland, criminal investigations.
In Finland, emissions to the environment and operations with environmental impacts are regulated by the Finnish Environmental Protection Act. The act contains a generally applied system of integrated pollution control based on an integrated environmental permit ("IPPC-type'' permit). Pursuant to the Act, an environmental permit is required for activities that pose a threat of environmental pollution, including impacts to all environmental media (e.g., soil, water and air). Activities subject to an environmental permit are non-exclusively listed in more detail in the Finnish Environmental Protection Decree (169/2000, Ympdristdnsuojeluasetus). The scope of activities covered is broader than in the EU's IED Directive or European Directive 2008/1/EC on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (``IPPC Directive"). Among others, the production of mineral products, waste disposal and mining are considered subject to an environmental permit. An environmental permit may be awarded if operations requiring the permit are not in conflict with a local detailed plan covering the area and do not result (either individually or in combination with other operations) in:
· harm to health;
· other significant environmental pollution or risk thereof;
· soil contamination or groundwater pollution;
