 first-priority claims include those arising from the debtor's liabilities to individuals for harm to life or health, or for moral harm (as defined under Russian law);
 second-priority claims arise out of the debtor's obligation to pay wages, salary or other amounts under an employment agreement or to pay fees or royalties to authors;
 third-priority claims include all other claims, including taxes and duties. Claims secured by a pledge or mortgage over the debtor's assets are partially (70-80%) settled out of the proceeds from the sale of such assets ahead of all other claims, with the remaining part used to settle the first- and secondpriority claims.
In addition to bankruptcy claims, there are also current claims of the debtor, i.e., those which have arisen after the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. These claims have super-priority in relation to unsecured bankruptcy claims. Russian bankruptcy law prescribes various categories of current claims and the priority of such claims.
