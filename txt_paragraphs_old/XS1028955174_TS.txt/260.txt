Over 2011-2013, the number of accidents at our sites has decreased from 126 in 2011 to 56 in 2012 to 40 in 2013, and lost-time injury frequency per million hours of work ("LTIF 1") decreased from 25.1 in 2011 to 12.4 in 2012 to 8.3 in 2013 and lost-time injury frequency resulting in leave of three or more days per million hours of work (``LTIF 3") decreased from 17.9 in 2011 to 8.3 in 2012 to 4.9 in 2013. We have taken a number of actions designed to maintain a safe environment at our sites: openly presenting the accident status of each site, properly marking safe passageways in factories, tracking safety performance indicators, recording incidents, identifying their causes and putting remedial actions into place where warranted and conducting safety inspections of our sites.
Environmental matters
The conduct of our operations requires compliance with regulatory regimes designed to protect the environment, including, among other areas, air emissions (including carbon trading), use of chemicals and waste handling. We endeavor to comply with all known environmental regulations and we are not aware of any material breaches of applicable environmental regulations by any member of the Paroc Group. In addition, each of our production facilities (except Tver) is certified to the ISO14001 (Environmental Management) standard. We believe that the operations at Tver are in line with the ISO14001 standard, but we have not yet applied for certification. Each of our facilities has an appointed environmental manager.
We have made certain provisions in our financial statements for environmental matters. These environmental provisions cover the costs from future closure of quarries related to landscaping, security arrangements and stacking area lining work and future closure of dumpsites related to landscaping. The provisions for dumpsites are estimated to be used between 2014 and 2019. The provisions for quarries are estimated to be used between 2020 and 2096, and as of December 31, 2013, a non-cash provision of 7.3 million has been recognized. A provision of 6.9 million has been recognized as of December 31, 2013 for demolishing and other closure costs related to the Lappeenranta production facilities. These costs are expected to be incurred by the end of 2018.
The Environmental & Sustainability function of the Group is situated in the Base Production division, supporting operations at all sites. A few of the major EU-wide environmental legal regimes to which we are subject are described below. For more information, and for country-specific environmental regulations to which we are subject, see ``Regulation" and "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our

Industry-- We are subject to numerous environmental, building, health and safety regulations, technical standards and other regulations."
EU Emissions Trading Scheme ("EU ETS")
The EU ETS works to cap the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by factories, power plants and other entities through three phases with the intention to lower the emission of greenhouse gas emissions over the life of the scheme. The manufacture of stone wool was not included in Phase I of the EU ETS. In Phase II (2008-2012), only facilities with two or more production lines were included, which included our Trzemeszno, Vilnius, Hällekis, Parainen and Lappeenranta production facilities. These facilities participated in Phase II as combustion plants (with thermal output of more than 20 MW). Our production facilities at Oulu and Hässleholm are required to participate in Phase III (2013-2020). Our production facilities at Skävde and the PPS production facility at Parainen are not currently subject to EU ETS.
