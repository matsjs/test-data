The Notes will be new securities for which there is no existing market. Although the Initial Purchasers of the Notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue market making at any time without notice. Accordingly, there is no assurance that an active trading market will develop for the Notes.
Application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange. There can be no assurance that any such application will be successful or that any such listing will be granted or maintained. The Global Exchange Market is not a regulated market for the purposes of Directive 2004/39/EC.
The Indenture and the Notes will be governed by the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be governed by the laws of England and Wales. The Security Documents will be governed by the laws of Finland, Sweden, Poland and Lithuania.
The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.
