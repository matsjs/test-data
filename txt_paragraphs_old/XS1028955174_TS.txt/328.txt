that is not a member of the Issuer Group or a subsidiary of the Issuer (such entity, the "Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer") and the liabilities in respect of guarantees granted by each guarantor of the Senior Unsecured Notes (the "Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee Liabilities") which is permitted or not prohibited under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture, any existing Pari Passu Debt Document and any existing Senior Unsecured Notes Document to rank in right of payment after the liabilities under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the liabilities under the Notes and any existing Pari Passu Liabilities.
The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that all Hedging Liabilities in connection with a Hedging Agreement will constitute "Super Senior Liabilities" (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), provided that certain Hedging Liabilities not in relation to the Notes, New Revolving Credit Facility, Pari Passu Debt or Senior Unsecured Notes may be designated as Super Senior Hedging Liabilities. The Issuer and the relevant Hedge Counterparty shall designate by notice to the Security Agent the maximum amount of any Hedging Liabilities under or in connection with such Hedging Agreement up to which the relevant Hedge Counterparty shall at any time be entitled to share in the proceeds of enforcement of any Transaction Security created by any Transaction Security Document and receive recoveries pari passu with the RCF Lenders. All Hedging Liabilities (a) under or in connection with Hedging Agreements entered into for the purpose of hedging (i) interest rate or currency exposures in relation to Senior Secured Liabilities (other than Hedging Liabilities) and (ii) certain actual or projected exposures in relation to certain non-speculative ordinary course funding and commercial activities, provided in the case of (ii) that the marked-to-market value of the hedging so designated which does not exceed 10 million in aggregate at any time (the ``Super Senior Hedging Cap"); and (b) after the RCF Discharge Date (as defined below) to the extent such Hedging Liability is permitted under each Debt Document to (i) rank pari passu with all other Super Senior Liabilities under the Debt Documents and (ii) receive proceeds of enforcement ahead of the Senior Secured Liabilities in accordance with the proceeds waterfall, shall be ``Super Senior Hedging Liabilities", and each Hedge Counterparty to the extent such liabilities are Super Senior Hedging Liabilities being the ``Super Senior Hedge Counterparty"). After the RCF Discharge Date, the Super Senior Hedging Cap shall continue to apply and all Hedging Liabilities under or in connection with any Hedging Agreement (other than in respect of certain non-speculative ordinary course activities) and all Hedging Liabilities with respect to certain non-speculative ordinary course activities hedging within the Super Senior Hedging Cap shall continue to be treated as Super Senior Hedging Liabilities irrespective of when the relevant Hedging Agreement was entered into but subject to the terms of each Debt Document and provided that such Hedging Liabilities may only receive the proceeds of enforcement ahead of the Senior Secured Liabilities in accordance with the proceeds waterfall to the extent permitted under each Debt Document.
Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict between the terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture, any Pari Passu Debt Document, any Senior Unsecured Notes Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail.
By purchasing a Note, Noteholders shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized the Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement on their behalf.
