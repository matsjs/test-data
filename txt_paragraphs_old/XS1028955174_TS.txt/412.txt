(2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or
provided, that the Issuer will procure that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor at such time as such restriction would no longer apply to the providing of the Note Guarantee or no longer would prohibit such Restricted Subsidiary from becoming a Guarantor (or prevent the Issuer from causing such Restricted Subsidiary to become a Guarantor).
At the option of the Issuer, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under "--R elea ses o f th e N o te G u a r a n te e s " A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction.
The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in "R is k F a cto rs-- R isk s R e la te d to th e
