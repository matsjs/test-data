Emission Trading Law in the European Union
In Sweden, the EU ETS has been primarily implemented by the Trading of Emission Allowances Act (Sw. lag om handel med utsläppsrätter 2004:1199).
Our operations in Hällekis and our operations in Hässleholm are subject to the EU ETS (our operations at Skövde are not subject to the EU ETS). The site in Hällekis have participated in the EU ETS during the second EU ETS period from 2009 to 2012 as a combustion plants (thermal output more than 20 MW). Since the beginning of the third EU ETS period (2013-2020) production of mineral wool from rock has been included as an industry in the EU ETS if the melting capacity is at least 20 tons per day. The site in Haässleholm is also subject to the EU ETS in accordance with this provision. According to the decision allocating emission rights in Sweden, the site in Hällekis will be provided with 38,544 tonnes of free allowances for 2014. The free allowances will decrease in subsequent years, and in 2020 34,302 tonnes of free allowances will be allocated to the Haällekis facility. A similar decrease has been determined for the Hässleholm facility. According to the decision, the site in Hässleholm will be provided with 22,106 tonnes of free allowances for 2014, but not more than 19,081 tonnes for 2020.
