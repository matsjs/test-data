· sell assets;
· obtain additional debt or equity capital; or
· restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.
We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes and our New Revolving Credit Facility, limit our ability to pursue these alternatives, as may the terms of any future debt.
Our liquidity is managed centrally by our Group treasury, which monitors liquidity on a daily basis. Under our treasury policy, we remit all excess cash within the Group to our Group treasury, which takes internal deposits and pays interest based on the financial transactions transfer pricing policy. Any Group companies which require financing can consequently borrow funds internally from our Group treasury. We operate cross-border cash pools that aim to improve the utilization of our liquidity. Our Group treasury makes short-term external deposits with approved banking counterparties that have a rating in short-term obligations of at least P-1 (Moody's) or similar. We give greater focus to security of funds than investment yield. We have set our minimum level of cash available at 25 million, including cash at bank and on hand and overdraft facilities.
Credit risk
Our main exposure to credit risk relates to trade receivables and other financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents. We have no significant concentration of third-party credit risk due to the large number of customers we have spread across our markets. We have adopted risk management procedures to both reduce and monitor credit risk. We perform ongoing credit quality evaluations of our customers and use external debt collection agencies under certain circumstances. In addition, we have insured against credit risk with respect to our trade receivables in all significant countries. All insured sales in excess of 5,000 are covered by a deductible of 10%. We also have our own internal credit policy, which specifies the principles that will operate in the event that an insurance company does not grant a limit to the relevant customer. In these cases, division management will have the power to grant an internal limit up to 100,000, beyond which authorization must lie with our chief financial officer and chief executive officer. We monitor the status of trade receivables on a weekly basis. We record a provision on the balance sheet for any trade and other accounts receivable overdue by more than 180 days or which are recognized as doubtful. We recorded a provision for doubtful receivables in the amount of 0.4 million as of December 31, 2013.
Credit risk with respect to our other financial assets, primarily comprising cash and cash equivalents, arises from the risk that the relevant counterparty becomes insolvent and is unable to return the deposited funds as a result of the insolvency. To mitigate this risk, we seek to transact and deposit funds with high-quality financial institutions that we deem to be creditworthy, and we monitor transaction volumes in order to reduce the risk of concentration of our transactions with any single counterparty.
