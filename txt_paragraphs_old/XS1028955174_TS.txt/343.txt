Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent is authorized: (a) if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release: (i) the Transaction Security over the assets of that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor; (ii) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities in respect of the Debt Documents (other than borrowing liabilities of the Issuer), its liabilities as guarantor in respect of the Secured Debt Documents and any trading or other liabilities it may have to an Intra Group Lender or another Debtor (``Other Liabilities"); and (iii) any other claim of an Intra Group Lender or another Debtor over the relevant assets; and (b) if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a holding company of a Debtor, to release: (i) the Transaction Security over the assets of that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company; (ii) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities in respect of the Debt Documents (other than borrowing liabilities owed by the Issuer), its liabilities as guarantor in respect of the Debt Documents (other than such liabilities owed by the Issuer to the Primary Creditors) and any Other Liabilities; and (iii) any other claim of an Intra Group Lender or another Debtor over the relevant assets.
(a) if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or a holding company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities of that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company under the Debt Documents (other than borrowing liabilities of the Issuer) or any liabilities owed by such Debtor, holding company or subsidiary to another Debtor (``Debtor Liabilities"):
(i) if the Security Agent does not intend that the relevant transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to enter into any agreement to dispose of all (but not part) of such liabilities owed to a Primary Creditor or all (but not part) of such Debtor Liabilities; or

(ii) if the Security Agent does intend that the relevant transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to enter into any agreement to dispose of all (but not part) of such liabilities owed to a Primary Creditor and all or any part of such Debtor Liabilities and any other liabilities under the Debt Documents, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors.
Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that the Security Agent is authorized, if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or a holding company of a Debtor (the ``Disposed Entity") and the Security Agent decides to transfer to another Debtor all or any part of that Disposed Entity's obligations (or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity) in respect of Intra Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities, to enter into any agreement to agree the transfer and acceptance of all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities on behalf of the Debtors which owe such liabilities and the Debtors to which such liabilities are to be transferred.
In the case of a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent shall not have an obligation to postpone any Distressed Disposal in order to achieve a higher price).
The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities owed to a Primary Creditor or disposal of Debtor Liabilities) (in the case of net proceeds received by a member of the Issuer Group, to the extent arising out of assets subject to the Transaction Security) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the payment waterfall described in ``--Application of proceeds from enforcement of Transaction Security'' above, as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities owed to a Primary Creditor or disposal of Debtor Liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Debtor Liabilities had not occurred.
