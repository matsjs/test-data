The quorum for any meeting of the board of directors of Luxco 1 or any Group Company, or any committee thereof (unless otherwise determined by the relevant board), is at least two Investor Directors, of whom one must be the Chairman or have been appointed as such by the Investor Directors for the relevant meeting. Where the failure of a specific Investor Director to attend at least two consecutive meetings has caused the absence of a quorum at each such meeting, the next following meeting shall be deemed to be quorate even if that Investor Director does not attend. Where there is only one Investor Director on the relevant board, a board meeting is only quorate if that Investor Director is present.
