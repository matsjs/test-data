The borrower is also obligated to pay a commitment fee computed on the daily unutilized, uncanceled amount, of the New Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 37.5% of the margin.
The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will have restrictions on the ability of the Group to repay, prepay, purchase, redeem, defease (or otherwise retire for value) ("Purchase") the Notes and certain other categories of its debt (excluding the New Revolving Credit Facility) (together, the "Relevant Debt"). The Group will be able to purchase the Relevant Debt in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement (i) if
175
such Purchase is made following the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), the Group is in compliance with its obligations under the change of control mandatory prepayment clause; or (ii) if no event of default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is continuing or would result from the Purchase and (A) the total aggregate principal amount of all Relevant Debt Purchased since the Issue Date does not exceed 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued on the Issue Date; or (B) to the extent the total aggregate principal amount of the Relevant Debt Purchased since the Issue Date exceeds 50% of the aggregate principal amount of all Notes on the Issue Date, commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are cancelled (and, if applicable, amounts outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are prepaid) pro rata.
Change of control
Upon the occurrence of a ``Change of Control'' as defined under the New Revolving Credit Facility: (a) the Issuer shall, promptly upon becoming aware of that event, notify the RCF Agent (as defined in ``Creditor representative" under "Intercreditor Agreement," below), and the RCF Agent shall promptly notify the lenders; (b) a lender will not be obliged to fund a utilisation (except for a rollover loan) under the New Revolving Credit Facility; and (c) (subject to the ability of the Issuer to replace that lender as described below) if a lender requires and notifies the RCF Agent within 30 days of the RCF Agent notifying the lenders of the Change of Control, the RCF Agent shall, by not less than ten Business Days' notice to the Issuer, cancel the commitments of that lender and declare the participations of that Lender in all outstanding utilisations (including ancillary facility outstandings), together with accrued interest, and all other amounts accrued under the New Revolving Facility finance documents, immediately due and payable.
If a lender gives a notification as described under (c) above, the Issuer may (on not less than five Business Days' prior written notice to the RCF Agent and such lender, or such shorter period as that lender may agree), replace that lender by requiring it to transfer all (and not part only) of its rights and obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to a replacement lender (which may be an affiliate of the ultimate shareholders of the Issuer, amongst other entities) selected by the Issuer (and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) for a purchase price in cash payable at the time of transfer equal to the outstanding principal amount of such lender's participations and all accrued interest, fees, costs and other amounts payable under the New Revolving Credit Facility finance documents. The replacement of a lender in such circumstances is subject to a number of further conditions, including that the Issuer shall have no right to replace the RCF Agent (other than in specified circumstances) or Security Agent.
Financial covenant
Under the New Revolving Credit Facility the Issuer will be obliged to ensure compliance with a financial covenant and the availability of new money amounts under the New Revolving Credit Facility will also be subject to the covenant. This financial covenant will be tested only if on the last day of a financial quarter the New Revolving Credit Facility is drawn by way of cash or otherwise, but excluding any utilisation of ancillary facilities by way of the SEK 35 million letter of credit referred to above. The covenant requires that the ratio of Total Drawn Super Senior Debt (the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding utilisations other than by way of the SEK 35 million letter of credit referred to above) to Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA as at the last day of the relevant financial quarter does not exceed 2.00:1. If tested, the borrower has right to cure any covenant breach by procuring the injection to Parent of new equity or subordinated debt, limited to four times during the life of the New Revolving Credit Facility and not in consecutive quarters. Breach of the covenant if tested (but subject to the cure right) results in an event of default.
