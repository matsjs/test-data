regulations, such as (i) implementing industrial safety control procedures; (ii) registering dangerous industrial facilities with the state authorities; (iii) using trained personnel; and (iv) obtaining liability insurance, among others. We have taken some, but not all, of the necessary measures to comply with the industrial safety regulations and will continue improving our compliance, but some time may pass before we become fully compliant. Moreover, some of our facilities in Russia (gas consumption facilities) may be regarded as explosive dangerous industrial facilities of III hazard class and, if this is the case, we will need to obtain a relevant license in order to operate gas consumption facilities. We have commenced this process, but the license is expected only at the end of 2014. Certain administrative sanctions (including temporary restriction of operations) may be imposed on our operations in Russia if we fail to promptly complete all industrial safety compliance procedures.
Other Regulations Production activities and conducting business in Russia as such are subject to various general and specific regulations. For example, each company that owns or operates a facility, including premises, must comply with certain fire safety rules in accordance with the Federal Act ``On Fire Safety.'' All companies must adopt internal instructions on fire safety at the premises, arrange for a special training course on fire safety for the employees, ensure preparation of evacuation plan at the premises and have firefighting equipment. The applicable fire safety rules set forth a number of exceptionally detailed rules governing the manufacturing process. For instance, the CEO of the company must ensure regular cleaning of the production premises and, in particular, extraction systems. Failure to comply with the fire safety rules may result in administrative sanctions, including, in the extreme, temporary restriction of operations. We undertake necessary steps in ensuring compliance with the fire safety rules and may engage specialized consultants to monitor the situation in the future. Furthermore, we need to comply with various employment regulations, including applicable migration legislation and legislation on certification of working conditions for our employees that may result in additional expenses. Overall, we are taking necessary steps to ensure compliance with various Russian regulations in our Russian business, but no full immediate compliance can be reached.
