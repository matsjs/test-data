Trust
Currently, Swedish law does not contain any provisions for trusts to be formed and trustees to be appointed. While Swedish law does not know the concept of trust, it is generally believed that a trustee that has been appointed under foreign law, provided that a trustee is capable of being appointed under the laws governing such appointment, will be recognized and acknowledged in Sweden in that such an appointed trustee may be able to claim and enforce or procure the enforcement of the rights of the beneficiaries under the trust, subject to the terms of the relevant documents. In order for a secured creditor to empower a trustee to represent them in Swedish courts, the secured creditor may have to submit a written power of attorney in favor of the trustee for legal proceedings. The failure to submit such a power of attorney could negatively affect the enforcement of the security. However, Swedish tax law does not have any special tax provisions regarding trusts and we express no opinion on whether instruments setting up a trust under the foreign laws would be enforceable for Swedish tax purposes.
Parallel Debt
The concept of parallel debt arrangements is not generally recognized under Swedish law and any agreement or document may not be enforceable to the extent it purports to effect such arrangements.
