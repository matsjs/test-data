Technical Insulation revenue increased by 4.6% from 144.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 150.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, despite volumes remaining generally flat, primarily as a result of our continued focus on sales of higher margin, value-added HVAC products resulting in an improved product mix variance, combined with an increase in prices for our TI products generally and the implementation of regulatory changes in Finland and Sweden requiring new buildings to have thicker, better quality technical insulation.
Revenue for our Panel System reporting segment decreased by 5.1% from 59.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 56.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of a decline in demand for PPS products due to slow market conditions in Finland and across Scandinavia (particularly in Norway, where there was a natural drop in the level of activity compared to the previous year, during which there were a particularly high number of construction projects requiring our PPS products), resulting in a reduction in our order intake, combined with a decrease in local currency prices and foreign exchange translation losses.
Cost of sales
Our cost of sales decreased by 2.2% from 318.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 311.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of a significant decline in the cost of raw materials (particularly coke) during the year, combined with an increase in the level of productivity in our manufacturing processes, partially offset by an increase in distribution costs due to increased sales into Russia, which involve the transportation of products over long distances to Russian customers and the incurrence of significant import tariffs.
Selling and marketing expenses
Our selling and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 remained flat at 34.9 million, compared to 34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
Research and development expenses
Our research and development expenses decreased by 9.4% from 6.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 6.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of a decline in R&D depreciation in the amount of 0.9 million, partially offset by a general increase in the level of spending with respect to R&D activities during the year.
