 rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

The Note Guarantees
The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. In addition, if required by the covenant described under ``--Certain Covenants--Additional Guarantees,'' certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee (as defined below) in the future.
