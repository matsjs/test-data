As of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, the Issuer and the Guarantors accounted for approximately 94.6% of the consolidated total assets and 95.3% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Group. For information on the calculation of the figures contained in this paragraph, see the section of this Offering Memorandum entitled ``--Summary--Summary Financial and Operating Information--Summary Other Financial Information."
In addition, as described below under ``--Certain Covenants--Additional Guarantees" and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, certain Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility in the future or certain other Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture may also be required to enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.
Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor's obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor's obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee.
