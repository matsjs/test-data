(e) an entity has no assets or income that could be used to execute (enforce) the debt and due to this reason a bailiff returned the writs of execution to a creditor.
(a) the creditors;
(b) the owner/owners (a shareholder/shareholders whose shares represent over 10% of voting rights); or
(c) the head of the enterprise.
A bankruptcy case (proceedings) is instituted if the court determines that any of the following conditions exist:
(a) an entity is insolvent or an entity is in arrears with the payment of salaries and employment-related amounts to its employees. Under Lithuanian law, insolvency of an entity occurs when it fails to settle its obligations (fails to settle the debts, perform obligation for which the remuneration has been received in advance, etc.) and when the obligations of an entity that are overdue (unsettled debts, unperformed works, etc.) exceed half of the value of the assets on the enterprise's balance sheet; or
(b) an entity publicly announced or otherwise informed its creditor about the inability or unwillingness to perform the obligation.
If the court institutes bankruptcy proceedings, the court must determine the period within which creditors' claims must be submitted for approval. This period may not exceed 45 days after the decision to institute the bankruptcy comes into force. Creditors acquire their rights as creditors in the bankruptcy process only after the court approves their claims and registers them on the creditors' list. If a creditor fails to submit their claim within the specified term, the court may approve the claim, but only if the creditor proves to the court that the there was good cause for their failure to submit their claim in a timely fashion.
According to Lithuanian bankruptcy laws, the bankruptcy process of an entity registered in Lithuania is to be governed by Lithuanian law and Lithuanian courts are to try related cases. The bankruptcy process can be carried out either in a judicial or an extrajudicial way.
