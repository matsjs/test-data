· Credit risk
The Group Treasury, which is legally located within Paroc Oy Ab in Finland, has the main responsibility to manage financial risks. The parent company Board of Directors has approved the treasury policy, which defines operative guidelines and responsibilities of risk management.
Interest rate risk
Paroc is exposed to interest rate risk due to its 350 million external debt. Existing loan agreements (Super Senior Revolving Facility Agreement and Senior Notes) have been valid since 23 December 2009. The interest rate risk is managed based on the treasury policy. The terms and conditions of the loans allow the Group to choose interest periods of anything between one and 12 months at every interest selection date. The senior loans have been fully hedged with interest rate swaps up to February 2015 whereby the Group pays fixed interest and receives three month Euribor. Cash flow hedge accounting is applied and the effective portion part of the changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income.
