For so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish T im e s) and in addition to such publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, mail such notice to Holders of the Fixed Rate Notes by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. Such notice of redemption may instead be published on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange (w w w .ise .ie ).
Redemption for Taxation Reasons
The Issuer may redeem the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the Holders of the applicable series of Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a ``Tax Redemption Date'') (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under ``--W ith h o ld in g T axes"), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:
(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or
(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a ``C h a n g e in Tax L a w " ),
a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the applicable series of Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the applicable series of Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) m u ta tis m u ta n d is to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.
Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under ``--S electio n a n d N o tic e ." Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the applicable series of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer's Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a

result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.
