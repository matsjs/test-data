· Panel System, which corresponds to our PPS division; and · Base Production, which corresponds to our Base Production division.
We also present in this offering memorandum certain eliminations and allocations, which provide for eliminations in respect of intercompany trading and other transactions between our operating divisions, as well as allocation of central overhead and management charges among our operating divisions, for purposes of Group consolidation. Our Base Production division is responsible for the manufacture of stone wool, which it supplies primarily to our BI and TI divisions pursuant to fixed price agreements entered into at the beginning of each year. Our Base Production division also makes very small external sales of raw stone wool directly to third parties. Our BI division principally markets and sells the stone wool products purchased from our Base Production division to external third parties, but it also makes internal sales of panel stone wool to our PPS division. Our TI division uses the raw stone wool purchased from our Base Production division to manufacture highly customized, value-added technical insulation products through specialized off-line production processes. Our TI division principally markets and sells its finished TI products to external third parties, but it also makes internal sales of specialized acoustic and roofing products to our BI division. For further details with respect to the trading relationships between our operating divisions, see ``Business--Divisions--Production facilities and intersegment sales." In the following tables, we present revenue data with respect to our Base Production reporting segment for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013. However, given that our Base Production division principally makes only internal sales to our other operating divisions and generates no material external income, we have not presented a discussion of the results of operations for our Base Production reporting segment for the periods under review, since such a discussion would not be meaningful. Rather, reference should be made to the discussion of results of operations presented hereafter for our Insulation reporting segment.
