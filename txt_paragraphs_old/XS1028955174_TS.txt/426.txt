The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose), money or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the "Satisfaction and Discharge" section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).
No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.
Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.
Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents
The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.
The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries. If the Trustee or any Agent becomes the Holder, beneficial owner or pledgee of any Notes, it may deal with the Issuer with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee, Paying Agent or any other such Agent.
238
The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.
Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.
