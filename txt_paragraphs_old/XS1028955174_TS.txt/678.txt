Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
12. Intangible assets (Continued)
As a result on the impairment tests performed, no impairment losses have been recognized on goodwill in 2013, 2012 or 2011.
Value-in-use calculations are made to estimate the recoverable amounts of CGUs. The calculations use pre-tax cash flows based on three-year strategy approved by the Board of Directors excluding any cash flows from expansion investments, and a growth rate to perpetuity of 2% (2012: 2%) per annum of cash flows beyond the budgeted period, which corresponds to the realized long-term growth of the CGUs and business areas in question. The key assumptions used in cash flow projections are based on management estimates and estimates made by Euroconstruct and VTT Technical Research Center of Finland. The most significant key assumptions affecting the projections are the development of residential construction business, and also the development of commercial building construction business which has an effect on Paroc panels.
