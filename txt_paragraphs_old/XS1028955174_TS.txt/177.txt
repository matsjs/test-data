Other financial expenses Our other financial expenses decreased by 11.7% from 11.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 10.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of movements in foreign exchange rates impacting the revaluation of internal loans and the market value of foreign exchange derivatives.
EBITDA Our total EBITDA increased by 11.0% from 69.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 76.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, which can be attributed principally to an increase in sales of higher margin, value-added HVAC products resulting in an improved product mix variance, combined with a significant decline in the cost of raw materials (particularly coke) and efficiency and productivity gains realized with respect to our manufacturing processes, partially offset by the incurrence of one-off costs in connection with the expansion of our Russian operations and the construction and commencement of operations of Tver Line 1.
