Following a declaration of bankruptcy, any debt (claim) payable in a currency other than zloty and included in the list of claims, regardless of whether it has become due or not, must be converted into zloty at the National Bank of Poland's average exchange rate prevailing on the date of the declaration of bankruptcy. Accordingly, in the event of bankruptcy of a Guarantor, its creditors, including holders of Notes, may be subject to an exchange rate risk between the date of the declaration of bankruptcy and the date of receipt of any amounts in the course of insolvency proceedings.
Although it is not entirely clear, it is expected that the Polish courts and/or a bankruptcy estate administrator (z a r z g d c a ) and/or a court receiver (n a d zo r c a s g d o w y ) and/or a bankruptcy trustee (sy n d y k ) (unless otherwise specifically stated, hereinafter the term "bankruptcy estate administrator'' shall include each of z a r z g d c a , n a d zo r c a sg d o w y and/or s y n d y k ) will not give effect to any priority of claims agreed in intercreditor agreements and/or subordination agreements. There is a risk that, in the course of insolvency proceedings, claims of all unsecured creditors will be discharged on ap a r i p a s s u basis, irrespectively of any intercreditor agreements and/or subordination agreements, and the creditors who are parties to such agreements may have to enforce their rights thereunder outside of the insolvency proceedings (e.g. by claiming the return of particular amounts from other creditors who are parties to such intercreditor agreements and/or subordination agreements).
Following a declaration of bankruptcy in respect of a Guarantor, the following would be recognized, by operation of law, as ineffective against the Guarantor's bankruptcy estate:
· any transaction of the Guarantor, including its guarantee, if such transaction was executed within one year prior to filing of the motion to declare the Guarantor bankrupt and to the extent that such transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, i.e., the Guarantor disposed of or encumbered its assets for no consideration or for a consideration where the value of the Guarantor's performance was glaringly higher than the consideration received by the Guarantor or reserved for a third party; the above restriction does not apply to security interests created before the date of the declaration of bankruptcy in connection with certain financial term contracts (te r m in o w e o p e ra c je fin a n s o w e ) borrowing of financial instruments (p o z y c z k a in stru m e n to w fin a n s o w y c h ) or repo contracts in financial instruments (s p r z e d a z in s tr u m e n to w fin a n s o w y c h z e z o b o w ia z a n ie m d o ic h o d k u p u ), provided such contracts satisfy certain conditions set out in the Bankruptcy Law;
· security interests established by the Guarantor or the payment by the Guarantor of a debt not yet due if the security was established or the payment was made within two months prior to the filing of the motion to declare the Guarantor bankrupt; however, the holder of the respective security or a recipient of payment may file a lawsuit or plea seeking the assertion of effectiveness of the respective security or the payment, if at the time of execution of the transaction that holder or recipient was not aware of the existing grounds for declaring the Guarantor's bankruptcy; the above restriction does not apply to security interests created before the date of the declaration of bankruptcy in connection with certain financial term contracts (te rm in o w e o p e ra c je fin a n s o w e ), borrowing of financial instruments (p o z y c z k a in s tr u m e n to w fin a n s o w y c h ) or repo contracts financial instruments (s p r z e d a z in s tr u m e n to w fin a n s o w y c h z e z o b o w ia z a n ie m d o ic h o d k u p u ), provided such contracts satisfy certain conditions set out in the Bankruptcy Law; and

· any transactions if entered into within six months prior to the filing of the motion to declare the Guarantor bankrupt and to the extent they were entered into with entities related to the Guarantor: (i) the Guarantor's shareholders, their representatives and/or relatives; or (ii) affiliated companies, their shareholders, and/or representatives or relatives of such shareholders; and/or (iii) the Guarantor's subsidiary or holding companies.
Further, the judge commissioner may, under a motion from the bankruptcy estate administrator declare any encumbrances (security interests) established over the assets of the Guarantor (such as mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, etc.) ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate, to the extent that the Guarantor was not the personal (direct) obligor with respect to the underlying debt and if the encumbrance was established within one year prior to the filing of the motion to declare the Guarantor bankrupt and the Guarantor received no consideration or the consideration received was glaringly low compared to the value of the encumbrance. However, irrespective of the value of the consideration received, the judge commissioner will decide that the security interests established over the assets of the bankrupt entity are ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if they secure obligations of an entity related to the bankrupt entity: (i) the Guarantor's shareholders, their representatives and/or relatives; (ii) affiliated companies, their shareholders, and/or representatives or relatives of such shareholders; and/ or (iii) the Guarantor's subsidiary or holding companies. Under Polish bankruptcy law, once bankruptcy of a company is declared by the relevant court no new encumbrances over such bankrupt company's assets may be established. This means that a registered pledge will not be entered into the relevant register of pledges post-bankruptcy, even if the registered pledge agreement had been entered into (and the application for filing had been submitted to the relevant court) before bankruptcy was declared. This limitation would not apply to mortgages in relation to which the application for filing had been submitted more than six months before the bankruptcy was declared.
Agreement on the security assignment of a thing, receivable or of another right is effective towards the bankruptcy estate if it was executed with a so-called ``date certain'' (i.e., date certified by a notary). A creditor who benefits from such a security assignment may not request that the assigned right or asset be excluded from the bankruptcy estate. It will have, however, priority in satisfying its claim from the proceeds of the liquidation of such rights or assets.
