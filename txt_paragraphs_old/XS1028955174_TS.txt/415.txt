and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The "Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ``--L im ita tio n o n I n d e b te d n e s s ." In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied, p ro v id e d that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days;
(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;
(3) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;
(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:
