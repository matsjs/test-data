We have been advised by our Finnish legal counsel that there is no treaty on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters between the United States and Finland. Courts in Finland will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. Under Finnish law, a Finnish title for execution (i.e., a Finnish court judgment) is required for such recognition and enforcement; in seeking a Finnish court judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to the matter in dispute. The application by a Finnish court of foreign law in a matter brought before it is subject to (a) the foreign law not being contrary to such mandatory rules of Finnish law that due to their public nature or general interest would be considered applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law; and (b) the application of the foreign law not resulting in an outcome contrary to the public policy (ordre public) of the Finnish legal system.
Sweden
We have been advised by our Swedish legal counsel that pursuant to the provisions of the Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of December 22, 2000 on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, as amended (the ``Brussels I Regulation") and the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (the "Lugano Convention"), a judgment entered against a company in the courts of a Member State (as defined therein, i.e., all Member States of the EU) or Contracting State (as defined in the Lugano Convention) and which is enforceable in such a Member State or such a Contracting State will be directly enforceable in Sweden only upon the satisfaction of the following requirements: (a) that a motion for enforcement has been filed with and granted by the Svea Court of Appeal in Stockholm as provided by law and has been granted and
313
(b) that the formal requirements in the Brussels I Regulation or Lugano Convention have been fulfilled. However, upon challenge of the decision on enforceability, the Svea Court of Appeal may under certain circumstances stay the proceedings.
Judgments entered against any Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not a member state under the terms of the Brussels I Regulation or a contracting state under the terms of the Lugano Convention (e.g., the United States) would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of law without retrial on the merits (but will be of persuasive authority as a matter of evidence before the courts of law, administrative tribunals or executive or other public authorities of Sweden). However, there is Swedish case law to indicate that such judgments:
· that are based on a contract which expressly excludes the jurisdiction of the courts of Sweden;
· that were rendered under observance of due process of law;
· against which there lies no further right to appeal; and
