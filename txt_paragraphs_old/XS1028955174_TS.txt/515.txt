In order to create a valid security interest under Swedish law: (a) there must be an underlying debtorcreditor relationship in respect of the obligations which the security interest purports to secure; (b) the pledgor must grant the security interest, typically in the form of a pledge agreement; and (c) an act perfecting the security interest must take place. The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type.
Foreign Currency
Whereas Swedish courts may award judgments in currencies other than Swedish kronor, judgments will be enforced in Swedish kronor, generally at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of enforcement rather than at the date of judgment.
Security Granted in Favour of an Agent
It is generally possible under Swedish law to grant security interests in favor of an agent acting on behalf of the secured parties. However, it is not established by judicial precedent or otherwise by law that a power of attorney or a mandate of agency, including the appointment of an agent (including any agent for service of process), can be made irrevocable. Therefore, any powers of attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the party giving such powers.
Stamp Duty
No Swedish stamp duty will be payable on the granting of the Note Guarantees and/or first priority security interests by the Swedish Guarantors or security providers, but may however be payable should the Swedish

Swedish stamp duty will be payable in connection with any sale of real property in Sweden (save for certain exempted transactions).
