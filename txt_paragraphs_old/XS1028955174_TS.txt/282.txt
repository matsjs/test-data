Hazardous Substances
In Sweden, specific permits to handle inflammable and explosive goods must be obtained pursuant to the Inflammable and Explosive Goods Act (Sw. lag om brandfarliga och explosiva varor 2010:1011). Such permits are always limited in time.
Health and Safety
The primary pieces of legislation relating to health and safety are the Swedish Work Environment Act (Sw. arbetsmiljölagen 1977:1160), the Swedish Work Environment Ordinance (Sw. arbetsmiljöförordningen 1977:1166) and regulations from the Swedish Work Environment Authority (Sw. arbetsmiljöverket). An employer has, as a starting point, a duty to implement systematic work environment management procedures, including, for example, processes for the assessment of risk and taking of preventive measures. In addition, there are several detailed regulations relating to health and safety, including obligations imposed on the employer regarding the workers' environment.
Regulation of Chemicals
In addition to REACH, Swedish legislation includes provisions regarding the use and handling of chemicals, such as those in Chapter 14 of the Swedish Environmental Code and regulations from the Swedish Chemical Inspectorate (Sw. kemikalieinspektionen). Moreover, Chapter 2, Section 4 of the Swedish Environmental Code provides that persons who pursue an activity or take a measure, or intend to do so, shall avoid using or selling chemical products or biotechnical organisms that may involve risks to human health or the environment if products or organisms that are assumed to be less dangerous can be used instead.
Technical Approvals for Construction Products
The EU Construction Regulation, discussed in "--Finland'' above, also applies to the Swedish market.
