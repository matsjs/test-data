Income tax expense consists of the balance of current tax expense, current tax from previous years, other direct taxes currently payable and deferred taxes.
We define EBITDA as profit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations before income tax expense, finance income and costs, depreciation, amortization and impairment and share of results of associates.
We present EBITDA in this offering memorandum only as a supplemental measure of our performance and liquidity. EBITDA is not recognized as a measurement of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS. See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information--Non-IFRS Measures' and "Summary--Summary Financial and Operating Information-- Summary Other Financial Information. "
