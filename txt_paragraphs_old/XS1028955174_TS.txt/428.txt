Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions
If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a

separate and independent obligation from the Issuer's and the Guarantors' other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Note Guarantee, or to the Trustee.
Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

Enforceability of Judgments
Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.
