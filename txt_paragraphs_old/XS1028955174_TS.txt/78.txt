(2) We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA for the applicable period divided by revenue for the same period.
(3) We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding items of a non-recurring or unusual nature, including in respect of our Russian expansion (including both our construction phase and our pre-commercial production phase), redundancies and restructuring, our transfer pricing case and the closure of our Lappeenranta site.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a uniformly or legally defined financial measure and is not a measurement of performance under IFRS and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to (a) operating profit or profit for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance or liquidity under IFRS. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful indicator of our ability to incur and service our indebtedness and can assist investors to evaluate us. Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are used by different companies for differing purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies. You should exercise caution in comparing Adjusted EBITDA as reported by us to Adjusted EBITDA of other companies. See "Presentation o f Financial and Other Information--Non-IFRS Measures."
