Withholding Taxes
All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a "Payor") in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:
(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or any Note Guarantee is made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or
(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a "Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction'7),
will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the Paying Agent with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the ``Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments, after such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding, deduction or imposition; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:
(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Note Guarantee;
(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, as applicable, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;
(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);
