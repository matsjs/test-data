A shareholders' resolution on liquidation of the company shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (B o la g sv e rk e t), which shall appoint a liquidator. Should the shareholders not resolve on such voluntary liquidation where required (which is where (i) a second shareholders' meeting is not held within the period of time stated above, or (ii) the new special balance sheet which was presented at the second shareholders' meeting was not reviewed by the company's auditor or fails to show that, on the date of such meeting, the equity of the company amounts to at least the registered share capital), the court may put the company into compulsory liquidation and appoint a liquidator. The liquidator takes over management and control of the company and shall sell the company's assets and settle the company's debts with the proceeds. The liquidator shall give notice to the company's unknown creditors and creditors that have not lodged their claims with the liquidator within six months following such notice will have forfeited their rights to their claims.
A Swedish limited liability company may not provide a guarantee or security for the obligations of a parent or sister company, unless they belong to the same group of companies and the parent company of that group is domiciled within the EEA. Furthermore, if a Swedish limited liability company provides any security interest or guarantee without receiving sufficient corporate benefit in return, such security interest or guarantee will, in whole or in part, be considered a distribution of assets, which will be lawful only (i) to the extent there is sufficient coverage for the restricted equity capital of the Swedish limited liability company after the distribution (i.e., at the time the guarantee is provided or the security is granted) and (ii) if considered prudent by the Swedish limited liability company to undertake such distribution after having taken into consideration the equity requirements imposed by the nature, scope and risks relating to the Swedish limited liability company's business or the Swedish limited liability company's need to strengthen its balance sheet, liquidity or financial position in general. Where the Swedish limited liability company is a parent company, the latter assessment is made also on a group level.
A security granted for a another party's obligation may also, in certain circumstances, be deemed to constitute a distribution of assets if, at the time the security interest is provided, the obligor of such obligation could be deemed unable to fulfill its obligation to indemnify the Swedish limited liability company if the security is enforced or if the security provider does not otherwise receive corporate benefit.

It should also be noted that laws relating to financial assistance in Sweden prohibit limited liability companies incorporated in Sweden from providing guarantees or granting security or other credit support for obligations of any person where such obligations are being incurred for the purpose of acquiring shares in the company itself or in any other superior member of the same Swedish group of companies.
The Note Guarantees of and security granted by the Guarantors incorporated in Sweden are limited in accordance with the above restrictions relating to prohibited security, distribution of assets and financial assistance and are subject to limitation language limiting the liability of such entities thereunder to the extent required by the above restrictions.
Creation of Valid Security Interests
In order to create a valid security interest under Swedish law: (a) there must be an underlying debtorcreditor relationship in respect of the obligations which the security interest purports to secure; (b) the pledgor must grant the security interest, typically in the form of a pledge agreement; and (c) an act perfecting the security interest must take place. The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type.
Under Swedish law, and in addition to formal perfection requirements, the creation of valid security interests over certain classes of assets is predicated on the security provider being effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest. Any security interests purported to be created under Swedish law over assets (other than security over assets represented by, including but not limited to, mortgage certificates, business mortgage certificates and share certificates, in each case provided that such certificates have been delivered to the secured party or its agent) which, prior to the occurrence of an enforcement event, remain in the possession of the security provider or over which the security provider retains control or in respect of which the security provider can freely operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income deriving therefrom would not be effective as against third parties until an enforcement event had in fact occurred and the control and rights are effectively taken from the security provider. Such delayed perfection of security interests are vulnerable under applicable provisions of Swedish law to being set aside as a preference in any Swedish insolvency proceeding affecting the security provider. Thus, a security provider must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the applicable secured assets, and arrangements providing for the release of a security interest over such an asset in connection with the disposal thereof or upon the occurrence of other circumstances would be at risk of impairing the validity of the security. To ensure validity of security interests despite the inclusion of such arrangements in the relevant documentation, such rights to sell or otherwise dispose of the security assets must either be subject to the consent of the security agent in its sole discretion or all proceeds of a disposal should be applied towards prepayment of the indebtedness which is secured by the security interests being released. It should be noted that the security interests granted under the account pledge agreements, the share pledge agreements (in relation to dividends), the receivables pledge agreements and contractual rights pledge agreements governed by Swedish law are constructed with delayed perfection and consequently, the delayed security interests under such pledge agreements may be vulnerable to be set aside as a preference in accordance with the above.
