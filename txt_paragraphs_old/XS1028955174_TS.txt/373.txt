In addition, prior to May 15, 2015, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of the Floating Rate Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes, as the case may be, plus the Applicable Floating Rate Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).
General
We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise. Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth below under ``--Selection and Notice."
If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, inform the Irish Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of Notes of that series that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.
If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.
