In conjunction with the Transactions, we expect to enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with a group of lenders which provides for up to 60.0 million of borrowing available in euro, sterling, SEK, USD, PLN and NOK, which can be utilised by way of loans, letters of credit or other ancillary facilities.

In addition, subject to certain conditions, additional tranches and/or facilities may be added under the New Revolving Credit Facility by utilising an accordion amount (which, when aggregated with any other such additions, does not exceed the applicable baskets therefor corresponding to those permitted under the Notes).
Borrowers
The original borrower under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be Paroc Oy Ab.
Letters of credit and guarantees
No letters of credit or guarantees will be drawn under the New Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date. However, an amount of up to SEK 35 million will be made available for such purpose under an ancillary facility by ING Bank N.V., London Branch, in order to roll our existing Pensions L/C in such amount into the New Revolving Credit Facility.
Guarantees and security
The New Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed and secured on a senior basis by the same subsidiaries that will guarantee and provide security in respect of the Notes and the Issuer, being the Guarantors (save that ZAO Paroc will not provide any security). For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, the guarantors generated 95.3% of the Group's EBITDA and, as of December 31, 2013, directly held 94.6% of the Group's consolidated total assets. As set forth in the New Revolving Credit Facility, the obligations of companies providing guarantees and security will be subject to certain customary limitations in order to comply with applicable laws in the jurisdictions of incorporation of the relevant companies. The guarantees will constitute direct, unconditional and unsubordinated obligations of the guarantors and rank at least pari passu with all other future unsubordinated obligations of the guarantors, except as otherwise provided by mandatory law.
