Guarantees and security
Guarantor coverage test
The New Revolving Credit Facility will contain a covenant requiring that the aggregate Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA and gross assets (excluding intra-group items and goodwill) of the borrower and the guarantors from time to time (but excluding any Russian Guarantors) equals or exceeds 80% of the Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA and total gross assets (excluding intra-group items and goodwill) of the Group (but excluding any Russian Subsidiaries). The guarantor coverage test will be tested on a semi-annual basis. We must ensure that additional subsidiaries acquired or which become material subsidiaries accede to the New Revolving Credit Facility as additional guarantors in order to maintain compliance with the guarantor coverage test within 60 days from the test date.
Amount and repayment of borrowings
The minimum amount of borrowing under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be 2 million and no more than 12 revolving advances may be outstanding at any one time. Each borrowing must be repaid on the last day of the borrowing's interest period, which can be a period of one, two, three or six months as selected by the borrower in the relevant drawdown notice or any other period agreed by the borrower and the lenders, and all loans must be repaid in full on the termination date.
Interest rates and fees
The annual interest rate on borrowings will be calculated based on EURIBOR, plus a margin of 3.25% per annum. The margin is subject to a margin ratchet and may be reduced by reference to the Group's Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). Interest on borrowings will be payable on the last day of the respective interest periods for such borrowing.
The borrower is also obligated to pay a commitment fee computed on the daily unutilized, uncanceled amount, of the New Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 37.5% of the margin.
