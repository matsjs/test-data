The terms of the security documents granted by each Finnish Guarantor other than the Issuer will limit enforcement in all material respects in the same manner and to the same extent as the above-mentioned limitations in respect of the payment obligations under the Finnish Guarantors' Notes Guarantees. The New Revolving Credit Facility will contain a substantially similar limitation (except in relation guarantees and security provided by the relevant borrower and its parent entities), but due to the different uses of the proceeds of the financings, the actual application of the limitation may lead to a different outcome in relation to the New Revolving Credit Facility than in relation to the Notes.
Security granted in favor of secured parties represented by a security agent
It is generally possible under Finnish law to grant security interests in favor of secured parties represented by an agent acting on their behalf and for this agent to act on behalf of the secured parties after the grant of security interest, e.g. in an enforcement scenario. However, it remains unconfirmed under Finnish law whether the appointment of this agent can be validly made irrevocable or whether the secured parties nevertheless remain entitled under Finnish law to terminate (jointly or severally) the power of attorney or mandate of agency granted to the security agent or whether such power of attorney or mandate of agency would terminate by law in certain circumstances.
Creation of a valid security interest
Other than in respect of the creation of a floating security over qualifying movable business assets in the form of a separately registered enterprise mortgage and the creation of registered mortgages over assets
290
belonging to certain specific asset classes (such as real estate qualifying vehicles and intellectual property rights) capable of being the subject of registered security, the creation of a valid and enforceable security interest under Finnish law is achieved by pledging the security assets and perfecting such pledge, typically by transferring such security assets into the exclusive physical possession of the pledgee. In order for the perfection to be effective, the pledgor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the security assets. If the pledgor remains in possession of, retains exclusive or shared control over, or remains entitled to operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from such assets, the relevant security interest will not be deemed to have been effectively created until it is duly perfected, typically after the occurrence of the agreed trigger event. Perfection cannot be achieved once insolvency proceedings have been commenced and can be deemed susceptible and be set aside in insolvency proceedings if perfected within a certain critical time before the commencement of insolvency proceedings.
Stamp duty
No Finnish transfer tax, stamp duty or similar will be payable on granting of the Note Guarantees by the Finnish Guarantors or on provision of guarantee by the Issuer.
