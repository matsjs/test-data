The Note Guarantees
The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will each:
 be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under "--Security";
 rankpari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee (including Indebtedness Incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations);
 rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; and
 be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness.
The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See ``Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure--The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law." The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in "Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations."
Not all of the Issuer's existing and future Subsidiaries are required to guarantee the Notes and not all of the Issuer's Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer.
