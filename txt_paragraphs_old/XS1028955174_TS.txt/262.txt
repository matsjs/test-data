Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH")
REACH was implemented to increase the protection of human health and the environment through measures designed to improve the safe use of chemical substances. REACH requires companies that put chemical substances on the EU market to secure the safe use of such chemicals. REACH requires that, unless exempt, all chemicals and substances manufactured, imported, or used within the EU must be registered with the European Chemicals Agency (``ECHA").
We registered our stone wool fiber, a man-made vitreous (silicate) fiber, with the ECHA in September 2010 and we believe we are compliant with the REACH regulations. Our ECHA registration covers the stone wool fiber used in all of our products. We are a part of the man-made vitreous fibers consortia, which manages the registration process.
