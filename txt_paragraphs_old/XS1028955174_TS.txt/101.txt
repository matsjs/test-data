(``EED")) adopted by the European Parliament and the European Council in 2012. The EED entered into force on December 4, 2012 and obliges Member States to set national energy efficiency targets and report any progress achieved towards these targets to the European Commission by April 30 of each year from 2013. The EED further states that Member States should encourage the use of financing incentives to further the objectives of the EED. Such financing incentives could include financial contributions and fines resulting from non-fulfillment of certain provisions of the EED.
Pursuant to the EED, as an alternative to setting up an energy efficiency obligation scheme, Member States may opt to take other policy measures to achieve energy savings among final customers. The annual amount of new energy savings achieved through this approach would be equivalent to the amount of new energy savings required by the energy efficiency obligation scheme option. Provided that equivalence is maintained, Member States may combine obligation schemes with alternative policy measures, including national energy efficiency programs. The policy measures may include, but are not limited to:
 the implementation of energy or CO2 taxes that have the effect of reducing end-use energy consumption;
 financing schemes and instruments or fiscal incentives that lead to the application of energy-efficient technology or techniques and have the effect of reducing end-use energy consumption;
 regulations or voluntary agreements that lead to the application of energy-efficient technology or techniques and have the effect of reducing end-use energy consumption;
 standards and norms that aim at improving the energy efficiency of products and services, including buildings and vehicles, except where these are mandatory and applicable in Member States under EU law;
 energy labeling schemes, with the exception of those that are mandatory and applicable in the Member States under EU law; and
