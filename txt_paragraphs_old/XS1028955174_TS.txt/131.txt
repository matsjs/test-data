We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was ``insolvent'' at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.
· the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets;
· the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or
· it cannot pay its debts as they become due.
The liability of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Note Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Note Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.
If a court decided that a Note Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Note Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Note Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Note Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Note Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Note Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. See ``Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations.''
The granting of the security interests in the Collateral may create hardening periods for such security interests in accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions.
The granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes and the entry into the New Revolving Credit Facility may create hardening periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period will run as from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated.
