AGREED SECURITY PRINCIPLES

Certain Principles
The Borrower and the Bondholders have agreed and acknowledged that their rights and obligations under the Finance Documents in respect of any Loan Security to be granted pursuant to Clause 8.2 (vii) of the Loan Agreement, shall be subject to and limited by the Agreed Security Principles. The Agreed Security Principles embody the recognition by all parties that there may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining effective security from all members of the Group in every jurisdiction in which members of the Group are or may in the future be located. In particular:
(a) general statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise. If any such limit applies, the guarantees and security provided will be limited to the maximum amount which the relevant member of the Group may provide having regard to applicable law (including any jurisprudence) and subject to fiduciary duties of management;
(b) the giving of a guarantee, the granting and the terms of security or the perfection of the security granted will not be required to the extent that it would incur any legal fees, registration fees, stamp duty, taxes and any other fees or costs directly associated with such security or guarantee which are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the Bondholders;
