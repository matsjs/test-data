(i) if the Shares are listed on an Exchange, and the rights are listed on such Exchange during the subscription period, a new Exercise Price be calculated as follows:
average price during subscription period
New Exercise Price = ------------------------------------------------------------------x old Exercise Price
average price during the subscription period plus
the averageprice o f the rights in the same period
The average price used in the above calculation shall be the average of the volume weighted average trading price of the Shares and the rights respectively on the Exchange during the subscription period. Days without trading are not included in the calculation.
(ii) if Clause 14.4 (i) is not applicable, each Warrantholder shall receive the same subscription right as all the shareholders of the Borrower, as if the Warrantholder had exercised its Exercise Right for all its Warrants effective from the last day on which the Shares are traded including rights.
14.5 In the event of any distribution being made in cash or in specie from the Borrower to its shareholders (whether in the form of a dividend payment, a share capital reduction, a de-merger or otherwise), the Borrower shall pay each Warrantholder an amount equal to the amount it would have received if it had exercised all its Warrants effective from the record date for such distribution.
14.6 If changes are made to the capital of the Borrower (other than those mentioned in Clause 14.1 - 14.5 above) on terms which would make the Shares to be issued on the exercise of the Warrants of a lesser financial value than the Shares held by all other shareholders as a result of such a change in the capital, the Loan Trustee shall determine a new Exercise Price. This also applies to other transactions, which materially adversely affect the financial value of the Shares which would be held by a Warrantholder on exercise of the Warrants. The principles expressed in Clauses 14.1 to Clause 14.5 above shall always be the basis for any adjustments pursuant to this Clause.
