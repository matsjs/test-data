14.5 In the event of any distribution being made in cash or in specie from the Borrower to its shareholders (whether in the form of a dividend payment, a share capital reduction, a de-merger or otherwise), the Borrower shall pay each Warrantholder an amount equal to the amount it would have received if it had exercised all its Warrants effective from the record date for such distribution.
14.7 If an adjustment of the Conversion Price requires a conversion to USD, the exchange rate shall be the official reference rate provided by the European Central Bank on the date triggering such adjustments. For the avoidance of doubt, when calculating weighted averages over several days, each day should apply the official reference rate for that day.

14.9 When any adjustment is required to be made in the Exercise Price under the provisions of this Agreement, the number Warrants shall be changed to the number determined by dividing (i) an amount equal to the number of Warrants outstanding immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment, by (ii) the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment.
14.10 If any disagreement should arise between the Loan Trustee and the Borrower as to any adjustment pursuant to this Chapter 14, the Borrower may request its independent auditors to express its opinion as to the correct adjustment. If no such request is made or if the Loan Trustee does not agree with the opinion of the Borrower's auditors, a reputable accounting firm independent of the Borrower shall be retained by the Loan Trustee to determine the adjustment, acting as expert and not as arbitrator, and whose decision shall be final and binding on the parties to this Loan Agreement. Each of the Loan Trustee, the Borrower and each Warrantholder shall be given the opportunity to present its views in writing to the auditors. The commercially reasonable costs of retaining the auditors for this purpose shall be carried by the Borrower.
