(a) general statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise. If any such limit applies, the guarantees and security provided will be limited to the maximum amount which the relevant member of the Group may provide having regard to applicable law (including any jurisprudence) and subject to fiduciary duties of management;
(c) where there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets owned by a Subsidiary in a particular category the principle stated at paragraph (b) above shall apply and, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, only the material assets in that category shall be subject to security;
(d) in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible or impractical to grant guarantees or create security over certain categories of assets in which event such guarantees will not be granted and security will not be taken over such assets;
(e) any assets subject to third party arrangements which may prevent those assets from being charged will be excluded from any relevant security document provided that, if the relevant asset is material and such endeavours are not reasonably likely to jeopardise commercial relationships with third parties, the relevant member of the Group will use reasonable endeavours to obtain any necessary consent or waiver;
(f) members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if, in the reasonable opinion of the directors of the relevant members of the Group, the same would conflict with the fiduciary duties of those directors or contravene any legal prohibition or result in personal or criminal liability on the
