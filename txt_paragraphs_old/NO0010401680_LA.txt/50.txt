14.10 If any disagreement should arise between the Loan Trustee and the Borrower as to any adjustment pursuant to this Chapter 14, the Borrower may request its independent auditors to express its opinion as to the correct adjustment. If no such request is made or if the Loan Trustee does not agree with the opinion of the Borrower's auditors, a reputable accounting firm independent of the Borrower shall be retained by the Loan Trustee to determine the adjustment, acting as expert and not as arbitrator, and whose decision shall be final and binding on the parties to this Loan Agreement. Each of the Loan Trustee, the Borrower and each Warrantholder shall be given the opportunity to present its views in writing to the auditors. The commercially reasonable costs of retaining the auditors for this purpose shall be carried by the Borrower.
15.1 If the Borrower decides on a statutory merger or amalgamation (in accordance with prevailing legislation from time to time) in which the Borrower is the acquired company, the Warrants shall, on completion of the merger or amalgamation, be transformed to rights to subscribe for shares (warrants) in the acquiring or amalgamating company, on terms adjusted for the exchange ratio applied in the merger or amalgamation.
The Warrantholders shall receive written notification of the proposed merger or amalgamation from the Borrower through the Securities Depository no later than 5 (five) Banking Days after the Borrower's board of directors has approved the merger or amalgamation.
15.2 Should the Borrower decide on a merger, in which the Borrower is the acquiring company, and shareholders in the acquired company receive settlement in the form of Shares or a combination of Shares and cash, no adjustment will be made to the Exercise Price.
15.3 In the event of a de-merger, a split-up, a spin-off or if any other event occurs which in the opinion of the Loan Trustee has the same effect as a de-merger, such adjustments to the Exercise Right and the Exercise Price shall be made pursuant to the principles as set out in Clause 14 as the Loan Trustee in its reasonable opinion shall consider appropriate.
