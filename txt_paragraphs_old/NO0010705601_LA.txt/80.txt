under the Bonds (less the amount blocked on the Issuer's Debt Service Account); and
(iii) Minimum Liquidity o f SEK 100 million.
The Issuer will report its accounts in NOK. Consequently the financial covenants tests will be based on the financial accounts in NOK converted into SEK at the SEK/NOK spot exchange rate on the relevant Quarter Date.
13.6.2
I f the Issuer fails (or would otherwise fail) to comply with any o f the financial covenants in Clause 13.6.1, and the Issuer within 10 Business Days o f becoming aware of such breach receives net cash proceeds from any person (other than an Obligor) in the form of new equity or a Shareholder Loan (a "C ure Amount"), then the relevant financial covenant shall be recalculated at the end o f such 10 Business Days period, by increasing the Book Equity, the Book Value o f Assets or the Minimum Liquidity (as the case may be) by the Cure Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, any part o f a Cure Amount shall only be taken into account once when determining compliance with any particular financial covenant and cannot be double counted. If, after giving effect to the foregoing recalculations, the Issuer is in compliance with all the financial covenants applicable at such time, the Issuer shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements o f the financial covenants as o f the relevant original date o f determination as though there had been no failure to comply with such requirement, and the breach o f the applicable financial covenants which had occurred shall be deemed to have been cured.
