triggering such adjustments. For the avoidance of doubt, when calculating weighted averages over several days, each day should apply the official reference rate for that day.
15.1 In the case of any consolidation, amalgamation or merger of the Borrower with any other corporation (other than a consolidation, amalgamation or merger in which the Borrower is the continuing corporation), or in the case of any sale or transfer of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Borrower, the Borrower will take such steps as shall be required by the Loan Trustee (including the execution of an agreement supplemental to or amending the Loan Agreement) to ensure that each Bond then outstanding will (during the period in which Conversion Rights may be exercised) be converted into the class and amount of shares and other securities and property receivable upon such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of Shares which would have become liable to be issued upon exercise of Conversion Rights immediately prior to such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer. Such supplemental agreement deed will provide for adjustments which will be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in clause 14. The above will apply, mutatis mutandis to any subsequent consolidations, amalgamations, mergers, sales or transfers.
15.2
If the Borrower decides on a merger in which the Borrower is the acquiring company, and the shareholders of the acquired company receive settlement in the form of shares only, subject to confirmation from an Independent Financial Adviser that such is the case, no adjustment will be made to the Conversion Price. If the shareholders of the acquired company receive settlement in any other form, in full or partly, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted according to such provision of clause 14 as an Independent Financial Adviser shall determine to be most appropriate.
15.3
The provisions in this clause 15 have no limitation on the creditor's right of objection to the merger or de-merger (to the extent any such rights will apply in accordance with applicable law). Notwithstanding anything of the foregoing, in the event of any consolidation, amalgamation or merger which the Borrower may enter into, the Bondholders shall in any event have equal rights as the Borrower has granted to the bondholders in the convertible loan with ISIN NO 001 0395981, if such loan facility is still in existence when the Borrower enters into any such consolidation, amalgamation or merger.
