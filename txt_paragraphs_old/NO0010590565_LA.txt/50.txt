If and whenever the Borrower shall issue any Shares credited as fully paid to the Shareholders by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves (including any share premium account or capital redemption reserve) other than (1) where any such Shares issued instead of the whole or part of a Dividend in cash which the Shareholders would or could otherwise have received or (2) where the Shareholders may elect to receive a Dividend in cash in lieu of such Shares, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such issue by the following fraction:
where:
A
is the aggregate nominal amount of the Shares in issue immediately before such
issue; and
B
is the aggregate nominal amount of the Shares in issue immediately after such
issue.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the date of issue of such Shares.
