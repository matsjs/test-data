13.8.1
in order to exercise the Cash Settlement Option, the Borrower shall deliver to the Paying Agent a duly completed, irrevocable and signed exercise notice within five (5) Banking Days after the Paying Agent has received an exercise notice for the Conversion Right(s);
13.8.2
the cash settlement amount shall be calculated as the product of (i) the number of Shares deliverable by the Borrower in accordance with the exercised Conversion Right(s), or such lesser number of Shares in the event of a partial exercise of the Cash Settlement Option, based on the Conversion Price in effect on the relevant Conversion Date (including any Additional Shares deliverable in accordance with clause 14.2), and (ii) the arithmetic average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of a Share for the fifteen (15) consecutive Dealing Days (the "VWAP Period") immediately subsequent to the date the Borrower has notified the Paying Agent that it will exercise its Cash Settlement Option in respect of the relevant exercise of Conversion Right(s), provided that if any Dividend or other entitlement in respect of the Shares is announced on or prior to the relevant Conversion Date in circumstances where the record date or other due date for the establishment of entitlement in respect of such Dividend or other entitlement shall be on or after the relevant Conversion Date and on any Dealing Day in the VWAP Period the Volume Weighted Average Price is based on a price ex-Dividend or other entitlement, then the Volume Weighted Average Price for such Dealing Day shall be increased by Dividend or other entitlement per Share as at the date of first public announcement of such Dividend or entitlement (or, if that is not a Dealing Day, the immediately preceding Dealing Day);
13.8.3 the cash payment is due and payable to the relevant Bondholders on the 3rd Banking Day following the end of the VWAP Period, however, in no event later than on the Maturity Date; and
13.8.4
notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, if the Paying Agent receives an exercise notice in accordance with clause 13.4 on a date falling on or later than twenty (20) Dealing Days prior to the Maturity Date, the Borrower shall within the date falling two (2) Dealing Days notify the Paying Agent that it will exercise the Cash Settlement Option. If the VWAP Period in such event would otherwise end later than the Maturity Date, the VWAP Period shall be adjusted to commence on
