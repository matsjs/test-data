To exercise its Share Settlement Option, the Borrower shall give a notice to such effect (the "Share Settlement Option Notice") to the Loan Trustee and to the Bondholders (in the case of the Bondholders, in writing via the Securities Depository). The Share Settlement Option Notice shall be given not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to the Maturity Date, in the case of a redemption of Bonds pursuant to clause 10.1, or not less than 45 days prior to the Optional Put Date in the case of a redemption pursuant to clause 10.4.

(b) making payment to the relevant Bondholder of an amount (the "Cash Settlement Amount") equal to the amount (if any) by which the aggregate principal amount of such Bonds exceeds the product of the Current Value of a Share on the Valuation Date and the whole number of Shares deliverable to such Bondholder in accordance with (a) above in respect of such Bonds; and
(c) making or procuring payment to the relevant Bondholder in cash of any accrued and unpaid interest in respect of such Bonds up to the relevant redemption date.

Shares to be delivered in the manner contemplated in this clause 10.5 (other than pursuant to paragraph (v) below) upon exercise of the Share Settlement Option are referred to as "Redemption Settlement Shares".
If the Borrower does not give a Share Settlement Option Notice in the manner and by the time set out in this clause 10.5, or if, having given a Share Settlement Option Notice, the Shares shall cease to be listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange or the London Stock Exchange or trading in the Shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange or the London Stock Exchange is suspended or an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default shall have occurred, the Bonds shall be redeemed for cash in accordance with the provisions of clause 10.1 or clause 10.4, as the case may be (and any Share Settlement Option Notice shall be annulled).
When used in this clause 10.5, the "Current Value" in respect of a Share on the Valuation Date shall mean 99% of the average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Shares for the fifteen consecutive Dealing Days ending on the Valuation Date, translated into USD at the spot rate of exchange prevailing at the close of business on each such Dealing Day.
