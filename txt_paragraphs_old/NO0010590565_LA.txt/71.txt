and provided further that, if on each of the said five Dealing Days the Volume Weighted Average Price shall have been based on a price cum-Dividend (or cum- any other entitlement) in respect of a Dividend (or other entitlement) which has been declared or announced but the Shares to be issued do not rank for that Dividend (or other entitlement)

the Volume Weighted Average Price on each of such dates shall for the purposes of this definition be deemed to be the amount thereof reduced by an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of any such Dividend or entitlement per Share as at the date of the first public announcement of such Dividend or entitlement, and provided further that, if the Volume Weighted Average Price of a Share is not available on one or more of the said five Dealing Days, then the average of such Volume Weighted Average Prices which are available in that five-dealing-day period shall be used (subject to a minimum of two such prices) and if only one, or no, such Volume Weighted Average Price is available in the relevant period the Current Market Price shall be determined in good faith by an Independent Financial Adviser.
"Dealing Day" means a day on which the Relevant Stock Exchange is open for business, (other than a day on which the Relevant Stock Exchange is scheduled to or does close prior to its regular weekday closing time).
"Dividend" means any dividend or any form of distribution to Shareholders (including a Spin-Off) whether of cash, assets or other property, and whenever paid or made and however described (and for these purposes a distribution of assets includes without limitation an issue of Shares, or other Securities credited as fully or partly paid up by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves) provided that:
(a) where a Dividend in cash is announced which is to be, or may at the election of a Shareholder or Shareholders be, satisfied by the issue or delivery of Shares or other property or assets, or where a capitalisation of profits or reserves is announced which is to be, or may at the election of a Shareholder or Shareholders be, satisfied by the payment of the Dividend in cash, then for the purposes of this definition the Dividend in question shall be treated as a Cash Dividend of the greater of (i) such cash amount and (ii) the Fair Market Value (on the date of the first public announcement of such Dividend or capitalisation (as the case may be) or if later, the date on which the number of Shares (or amount of property or assets, as the case may be) which may be issued or delivered is determined), of such Shares or other property or assets;
(b) any issue of Shares falling within clause 14.2 shall be disregarded;
(c) a purchase or redemption or buy back of share capital of the Borrower by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower shall not constitute a Dividend unless, in the case of purchases, redemptions or buy backs of Shares by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, the weighted average price per Share (before expenses) on any one day (a "Specified Share Day") in respect of such purchases, redemptions or buy backs (translated, if not in Norwegian Kroner, into Norwegian Kroner at the spot rate ruling at the close of business on such day as determined in good faith by an Independent Financial Adviser (or if no such rate is available on that date, the equivalent rate on the immediately preceding date on which such rate is available), exceeds by more than 5 per cent, the average of the closing prices of the Shares on the Relevant Stock Exchange (as published by or derived from the Relevant Stock Exchange) on the five Dealing Days immediately preceding the Specified Share Day or, where an announcement (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt for these purposes, any general authority for such purchases approved by a general meeting of Shareholders or any notice convening such a meeting of Shareholders) has been made of the intention to purchase Shares at some future date at a specified price, on the five Dealing Days immediately
