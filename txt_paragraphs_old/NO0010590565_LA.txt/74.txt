"Volume Weighted Average Price" means, in respect of a Share, Security or, as the case may be, a Spin-Off Security on any Dealing Day, the volume-weighted average price of a Share, Security or, as the case may be, a Spin-Off Security published by or derived (in the case of a Share) from the Relevant Stock Exchange or (in the case of a Security or SpinOff Security) from the principal stock exchange or securities market on which such Securities or Spin-Off Securities are then listed or quoted or dealt in, if any or, in any such case, such other source as shall be determined to be appropriate by an Independent Financial Adviser on such Dealing Day, provided that if on any such Dealing Day where such price is not available or cannot otherwise be determined as provided above, the Volume Weighted Average Price of a Share, Security or a Spin-Off Security, as the case may be, in respect of such Dealing Day shall be the Volume Weighted Average Price, determined as provided above, on the immediately preceding Dealing Day on which the same can be so determined.
In making any calculation or determination of Current Market Price or Volume Weighted Average Price, such adjustments (if any) shall be made as an Independent Financial Adviser considers appropriate to reflect any consolidation or sub-division of the Shares or any issue of Shares by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves, or any like or similar event.

This also applies to other transactions, which are unfavourable to the Bondholders.
14.17 If the Conversion Price is below par value of the Shares, par value of the Shares still applies, and the Borrower shall upon conversion pay the Bondholders the difference between the par value of the Shares and the Conversion Price.
14.18 If an adjustment of the Conversion Price requires a conversion to USD, the exchange rate shall be the official reference rate provided by the European Central Bank on the date
