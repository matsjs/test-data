14.14 On any adjustment, the resultant Conversion Price, if not an integral multiple of USD 0.0001, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of USD 0.0001. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price where such adjustment (rounded down if applicable) would be less than one per cent, of the Conversion Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any amount by which the Conversion Price has been rounded down, shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and such subsequent adjustment shall be made on the basis that the adjustment not required to be made had been made at the relevant time.
Notice of any adjustments to the Conversion Price shall be given by the Borrower to Bondholders and the Loan Trustee promptly after the determination thereof.
The Conversion Price shall not in any event be reduced to below the nominal value of the Shares and the Borrower undertakes that it shall not take any action, and shall procure that no action is taken, that would otherwise result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price to below such nominal value.
14.15 "Current Market Price" means, in respect of a Share at a particular date, the average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of a Share for the five consecutive Dealing Days ending on the Dealing Day immediately preceding such date; provided that if at any time during the said five-dealing-day period the Volume Weighted Average Price shall have been based on a price ex-Dividend (or ex- any other entitlement) and during some other part of that period the Volume Weighted Average Price shall have been based on a price cum-Dividend (or cum- any other entitlement), then:
14.15.1 if the Shares to be issued or transferred do not rank for the Dividend (or entitlement) in question, the Volume Weighted Average Price on the dates on which the Shares shall have been based on a price cum-Dividend (or cum- any other entitlement) shall for the purpose of this definition be deemed to be the amount thereof reduced by an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of any such Dividend or entitlement per Share as at the date of first public announcement of such Dividend (or entitlement); or
14.16.2 if the Shares to be issued or transferred do rank for the Dividend (or entitlement) in question, the Volume Weighted Average Price on the dates on which the Shares shall have been based on a price ex-Dividend (or ex- any other entitlement) shall for the purpose of this definition be deemed to be the amount thereof increased by an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of any such Dividend or entitlement per Share as at the date of first public announcement of such Dividend (or entitlement),
and provided further that, if on each of the said five Dealing Days the Volume Weighted Average Price shall have been based on a price cum-Dividend (or cum- any other entitlement) in respect of a Dividend (or other entitlement) which has been declared or announced but the Shares to be issued do not rank for that Dividend (or other entitlement)
