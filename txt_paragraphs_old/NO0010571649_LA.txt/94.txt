Merger and de-merger
D. 1 In the case o f any consolidation, amalgamation or merger of the Issuer with any other corporation (other than a consolidation, amalgamation or merger in which the Issuer is the continuing corporation), or in the case of any sale or transfer of all, or substantially all, o f the assets of the Issuer, the Issuer will take such steps as shall reasonably be required by the Bond Trustee (including the execution of an agreement supplemental to or amending the Bond Agreement) to ensure that each Bond then outstanding will (during the period in which Conversion Rights may be exercised) be converted into the class and amount of shares and other securities and property receivable upon such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer by a holder o f the number of Shares which would have become liable to be issued upon exercise o f Conversion Rights immediately prior to such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer. Such supplemental agreement will provide for adjustments which will be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in clause C. The above will apply, mutatis mutandis to any subsequent consolidations, amalgamations, mergers, sales or transfers,
The Issuer shall give the Bondholders written notification through the Securities Register at the latest five (5) Business Days after notification o f the merger.

D.5 In the event of a de-merger, a split-up, a spin-off, split-off or if any other event occurs which in the opinion of the Bond Trustee has the same effect as a de-merger, the Issuer will take such steps as required by the Bond Trustee shall in order to implement appropriate adjustments to the Conversion Right and the Conversion Price, which shall be made pursuant to the principles as set out in Clause D. 1.
D.6 The provisions in this Clause D have no limitation on the creditor's right of objection to the merger or de-merger.
