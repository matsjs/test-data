(b) The Issuer undertakes to transfer the Additional DSRA Amount to the Debt Service Retention Account no later than 20 days after it has notified the Bond Trustee of any Delay. The Additional DSRA Amount shall be determined by the Bond Trustee on the basis of information provided to the Bond Trustee by the Issuer.
(b) Notwithstanding the above:
(i) the Issuer may, subject to prior written notice to the Bond Trustee, agree to minor amendments of the Evry Lease Agreement for the purpose of facilitating reasonable technical upgrades and/or maintenance of the Property and/or the Data Centre; and
(ii) the Issuer may agree to any amendment of the Evry Lease Agreement, provided that:
(A) if such amendment is likely to reduce the Market Value, the Issuer can demonstrate that, by delivering an updated Market Value (which shall be made on the assumption that the relevant amendment has been made) to the Bond Trustee before the relevant amendment is agreed, the Issuer is in compliance with the Loan-to-Value Ratio immediately after giving effect to the relevant amendment; and
(B) if such amendment is likely to reduce the payments to the Issuer under the Evry Lease Agreement, the Issuer can demonstrate to the Bond Trustee that the Interest Cover Ratio is above 1.5.
For the purpose of the above, "Interest Cover Ratio" means the ratio (based on reasonable assumptions acceptable to the Bond Trustee) of (i) the aggregate amount of payments to the Issuer under the Evry Lease Agreement less budgeted opex costs to (ii) the aggregate amount of interest paid on the Bonds (assuming no Event of Default), in each case for a period starting on the date the relevant amendment is to be given effect and ending on the Final Maturity Date. If the relevant amendment is to be adopted before the Construction Completion Date, then the Interest Cover Ratio shall be calculated for the period starting on the then expected Construction Completion Date and ending on the Final Maturity Date.
13.4 Maintenance of Accounts 13.4.1 The Issuer shall maintain all Accounts with Account Banks.
