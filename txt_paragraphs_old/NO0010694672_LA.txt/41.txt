and including such Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the first Interest
Payment Date after the date on which listing of the Bonds occurs; and
(b) 22 November 2014 (the "Non-listing Put Option Event"), each bondholder shall have a right of pre-payment (put option) of the Bonds in accordance with Clause 10.4.
The Issuer shall ensure that the Bonds remain listed until they have been discharged in full.
