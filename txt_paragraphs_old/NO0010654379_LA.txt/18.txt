THE BONDS
2.1 Binding nature of the Bond Agreement
2.1.1 The initial Bondholders have in the subscription agreements granted authority to the Bond Trustee to finalise and execute the Bond Agreement on the Bondholders' behalf, therefore the Bondholders are, through their subscription, purchase or other transfer of Bonds bound by the terms of this Bond Agreement and the other Finance Documents. All Bond transfers are subject to the terms of this Bond Agreement. All Bond transferees are, in taking transfer of Bonds, deemed to have accepted the terms of the Bond Agreement and the other Finance Documents and will automatically become parties to the Bond Agreement upon completed transfer having been registered, without any further action required to be taken or formalities to be complied with, see also Clause 18.1 (The community o fBondholders).
