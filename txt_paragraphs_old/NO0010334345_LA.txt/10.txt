However, if this day falls in the following calendar month, the Interest Payment Date is moved to the first Banking Day preceding the original date.
The interest rate rounded off to five decimal places for a 3 - three - month period that is quoted on Reuters Screen LIBOROl page as of 11.00 a.m. London time on the Interest Determination Date.
Should the contents of the Reuters Screen LIBOROl page be changed such that, in the opinion of the Loan Trustee and the Borrower, the interest rates shown no longer represent the same kind of interest rates as when the Loan was disbursed, or the relevant page is removed from the Reuters Screen, another news page shall be used. This page may be another Reuters Screen's page or, that of another electronic news agency, if it, in the opinion of the Loan Trustee, specifies the same kind of interest rates as Reuters Screen LIBOROl page did on the Disbursement Date. Any disagreement of opinion between the Borrower and the Loan Trustee concerning the use of a new page must be treated as described in Clause 9.3 of the Loan Agreement.
