Platanen Holdings B.V., controlled by Carl Rosenblad and his family, controls a larger part of the votes in the Issuer. In addition, Carl Rosenblad is the Chairman of the Board of the Issuer. Platanen Holdings B.V. and Carl Rosenblad and his family have therefore an essential influence and control of the Issuer, and possibly could have interests which necessarily are not the same as the interests of the Noteholders. However, the shares of class B of the Issuer are listed on the regulated market of NASDAQ OMX, small cap list. The Issuer must therefore follow the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance and requirements such as independent board members and announcements of information. This makes it more difficult to abuse control of the Issuer.
