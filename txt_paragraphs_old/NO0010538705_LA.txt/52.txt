Such adjustment shall become effective on the first date on which the Shares are traded ex- the relevant Dividend on the Relevant Stock Exchange or, in the case of a purchase of Shares or any receipts or certificates representing Shares, on the date such purchase is made or, in the case of a Spin-Off, the first date on which the Shares are traded ex- the relevant Spin-Off.
For the purposes of the above, the Fair Market Value of a Cash Dividend shall (subject as provided in paragraph (a) of the definition of "Dividend" and in the definition of "Fair Market Value") be determined as at the first date on which the Shares are traded ex- the relevant Dividend on the Relevant Stock Exchange, and in the case of a Non Cash Dividend, the Fair Market Value of the relevant Dividend shall be the Fair Market Value of the relevant Spin-Off Securities or, as the case may be, the relevant property or assets.

"Cash Dividend" means (i) any Dividend which is to be paid or made in cash (in whatever currency), but other than falling within paragraph (b) of the definition of "Spin-Off' and (ii) any Dividend determined to be a Cash Dividend pursuant to paragraph (a) of the definition of "Dividend", and for the avoidance of doubt, a Dividend falling within paragraph (c) or (d) of the definition of "Dividend" shall be treated as being a Non-Cash Dividend.
