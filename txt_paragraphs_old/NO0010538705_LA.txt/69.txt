which the Shares shall have been based on a price cum-Dividend (or cum- any other entitlement) shall for the purpose of this definition be deemed to be the amount thereof reduced by an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of any such Dividend or entitlement per Share as at the date of first public announcement of such Dividend (or entitlement); or
(b) if the Shares to be issued or transferred do rank for the Dividend (or entitlement) in question, the Volume Weighted Average Price on the dates on which the Shares shall have been based on a price ex-Dividend (or ex- any other entitlement) shall for the purpose of this definition be deemed to be the amount thereof increased by an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of any such Dividend or entitlement per Share as at the date of first public announcement of such Dividend (or entitlement),
and provided further that, if on each of the said five Dealing Days the Volume Weighted Average Price shall have been based on a price cum-Dividend (or cum- any other entitlement) in respect of a Dividend (or other entitlement) which has been declared or announced but the Shares to be issued do not rank for that Dividend (or other entitlement) the Volume Weighted Average Price on each of such dates shall for the purposes of this definition be deemed to be the amount thereof reduced by an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of any such Dividend or entitlement per Share as at the date of the first public announcement of such Dividend or entitlement,
and provided further that, if the Volume Weighted Average Price of a Share is not available on one or more of the said five Dealing Days, then the average of such Volume Weighted Average Prices which are available in that five-dealing-day period shall be used (subject to a minimum of two such prices) and if only one, or no, such Volume Weighted Average Price is available in the relevant period the Current Market Price shall be determined in good faith by an Independent Financial Adviser.
