2.4 The Company may choose not to issue the full amount of Bonds on the Issue Date and may in such case, provided that no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue, choose to issue the remaining amount of Bonds at one or more subsequent dates ("Subsequent Bond Issue"). The price of Bonds issued in a Subsequent Bond Issue may be set at a discount or at a
higher price than the Nominal Amount and shall, for the avoidance of doubt, have the same ISIN, Interest Rate, Nominal Amount, Final Maturity Date and other rights as Bonds issued on the Issue Date.
2.5 The purpose of the bond loan is general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and refinancing of existing debt.
3 Status
The Bonds constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and shall at all times rank pari passu without any preference among them.
4 The Bonds and transferability
4.1 Each Holder is bound by these Terms and Conditions without there being any further actions required to be taken or formalities to be complied with.
4.2 The Bonds are freely transferable. All Bond transfers are subject to the terms of these Terms and Conditions and these Terms and Conditions are automatically applicable in relation to all Bond transferees upon completed transfer.
4.3 Holders may be subject to purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Bonds, as applicable from time to time under local laws to which a Holder may be subject (due e.g. to its nationality, its residency, its registered address or its place(s) for doing business). Each Holder must ensure compliance with local laws and regulations applicable at own cost and expense.
