The average price of the Share shall be considered to correspond to the average of the mean of the highest and lowest prices paid each trading day during the above stated period of twenty-five (25) trading days in accordance with the official price list of the Market Place. In the absence of a quotation of a paid price, the last bid price quoted shall be used in the calculation. If neither a paid price nor a bid price is quoted on a given day, that day shall be excluded from the calculation.
The adjusted Conversion Price calculated and described above shall be set by the Bank two (2) Business Days after the close of such period of twenty-five (25) trading days beginning on the date when the shares were listed ex-rights to the dividend and shall be applied in Conversions effected thereafter.
If Conversion has been requested but, due to the provisions in Clause 13 above, final registration in the securities account has not been completed, it shall be specially noted that the Convertible claim according to the adjusted Conversion Price can carry the right to further shares. Final registration in the share account shall occur after the adjusted Conversion Price has been established, but not earlier than at the time set forth in Clause 13 above.
G. If the Borrower's share capital should be reduced through a repayment to its shareholders, and the reduction is compulsory, an adjusted Conversion Price shall be applied. The adjustment shall be made by the Conversion Agent in accordance with the following formula:
adjusted Conversion Price =
previous Conversion Price x average market price of the Shares during a period of 25 trading days beginning on the date when the shares were quoted without repayment rights (average share price)
