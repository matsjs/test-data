In the event that shareholders receive purchase rights and if trading of such rights has taken place, the value of the right to participate in the offer shall be considered to correspond to the value of the purchase right. The value of the purchase right shall be considered to correspond to the average of the mean of the highest and lowest prices paid for such rights on each trading day in transactions as recorded in the the Market Place's official list of prices during the subscription period. In the absence of a quotation of a paid price, the last bid price quoted shall be included in the calculation. If neither a paid price nor a bid price is quoted on a given day, that day shall be excluded from the calculation of the value of the purchase rights.
