If the decision to liquidate is made at a General Meeting of Shareholders, this right becomes effective on the day following the Meeting or else on the day following the date on which the court order or liquidation has come into legal force. Within a week thereafter, the Borrower shall notify the Bondholders in writing, reminding them of their right to demand immediate payment.
Not later than two (2) months before the General Meeting of Shareholders determines whether the Borrower should enter into voluntary liquidation, as provided in Chapter 25, Section 1 of the Swedish Companies Act, the Bondholders shall be informed of the planned liquidation. The notice shall include a reminder that Conversion may not be requested after the Meeting has voted to liquidate.
If the Borrower gives notice of planned liquidation as stated above, Bondholders are entitled - notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13 above regarding the earliest time for requesting Conversion - to request Conversion from the date when the notice was issued, provided that Conversion can be effected not later than the tenth calendar day prior to the General Meeting of Shareholders at which the issue of the Borrower's liquidation is to be considered.

However, the Bondholders have the right, during a period of two (2) months from the date of such approval, to demand immediate payment of the principal amount of their Bonds, plus interest accrued to the date of payment.
The Borrower shall notify the Bondholders, advising them of this right, not later than one (1) week following the beginning of such period. Nothing contained herein shall impair rights that may legally accrue to the Bondholders in their capacity as creditors in conjunction with a merger.
