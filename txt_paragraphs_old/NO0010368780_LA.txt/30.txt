adjusted Conversion Price = previous Conversion Price x number of shares prior to bonus

The adjusted Conversion Price as calculated above shall be determined by the Conversion Agent as soon as possible after the resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders regarding the bonus issue, but not applicable to Conversions effected until after the record date for the bonus issue.
B. If the Borrower effects a consolidation or a split of its shares, sub-section A above shall apply correspondingly, in which case the record date shall be considered to be the date upon which such consolidation or split is registered at the VPC at the request of the Borrower.
C. If the Borrower issues new shares - with preferential rights to its shareholders to subscribe for new shares for cash or offset against a claim - the following shall apply with respect to the rights to participate in the new issue that accrue to shares arising from the Conversion:
1. If the new issue is resolved by the Board of Directors subject to the approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders or as authorized by the Meeting, the Board's resolution and the announcement of the new issue shall specify the latest date when Conversion shall have to have been effected in order for shares issued upon Conversion to have rights to participate in the new issue. Such date may not be earlier than the tenth calendar day following the date of the notice.
2. If the new issue is to be approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders, Conversion - requested on a date such that Conversion cannot be effected at the latest on the tenth calendar day prior to the date of the General Meeting of Shareholders that approves the new issue - will not be effected until the Conversion Agent has set the adjusted Conversion Price in accordance with the second last paragraph of this sub-section C. Shares issued upon such Conversions will be entered in the securities account on an interim basis, and shall not entitle the Bondholders to participate in the new issue.
