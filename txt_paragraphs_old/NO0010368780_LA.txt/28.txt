12.1 The Borrower has the right to acquire Bonds. Bonds acquired by the Borrower will as a result of mandatory Swedish law cease to be valid and may not be sold or re-issued and shall as a result be discharged against the Remaining Loan.
13.1 Each Bondholder may exercise one or more of his Conversion Right(s) at the Conversion Price at any time during the Exercise Period provided that the relevant Bondholder at the Conversion Date has the right to own Shares under the applicable law and that notification thereof is given pursuant to Clause 13.4.
13.2 The Conversion Right cannot be separated from the Bond.
13.3 The Conversion Price may be adjusted pursuant to Clause 14.
13.4 In order to exercise a Conversion Right, the Bondholder shall deliver to the Conversion Agent (via its Account Manager) a duly completed, irrevocable and signed exercise notice.
Request for conversion takes place by the Bondholder notifying its Account Manager of the number of Bonds which shall be converted. The Account Manager shall then promptly forward the request to the Conversion Agent. The Conversion Agent shall carry the conversion into effect as follows.
Upon Conversion, one (1) Share shall be obtained for each full amount equivalent to the Conversion Price of the total nominal principal amount of the Bonds that one and the same Holder wishes to convert at the same time. If this amount is not exactly divisible by the Conversion Price, the excess sum shall fall to the Borrower.
Conversion is effected by the Shares being recorded as interim shares in the share register of the Company kept by the VPC (the date on which such event occurs in respect of a Bond is a "Conversion Date" in respect of such Bond). Once registration has taken place at the Swedish Companies Registration Office, the registration in the share accounts will become
final. As described in Clause 14 below, such final registration may be deferred in certain cases.
