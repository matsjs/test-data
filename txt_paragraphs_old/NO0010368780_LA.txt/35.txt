value of subscription rights
The value of subscription rights shall be considered to correspond to the average of the mean of the highest and the lowest prices paid for such rights each trading day in transactions as recorded in the Market Place's official list of prices during the subscription period. In the absence of a quotation of a paid price, the last bid price quoted shall be included in the calculation. If neither a paid price nor a bid price is quoted on a given day, that day shall be excluded from calculation of the value of subscription rights.
The adjusted Conversion Price calculated and described above shall be set by the Bank two (2) Business Days following expiry of the subscription period and shall be applied in connection with Conversions effected thereafter.
In connection with a Conversion effected during the period until the adjusted Conversion Price is set, the rules stated in sub-section C, in the last paragraph, shall apply correspondingly.
