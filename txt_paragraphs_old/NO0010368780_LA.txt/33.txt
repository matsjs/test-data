resolution authorizing new shares
If this calculation produces a negative value, the theoretical value of the subscription rights shall be fixed at zero.
The adjusted Conversion Price calculated and described above shall be set by the Conversion Agent two (2) Business Days following the expiration of the subscription period and shall be applied in any Conversion effected thereafter.
During the period until the adjusted Conversion Price is set, only a preliminary Conversion shall be effected, in connection with which the number of full shares according to the as yet unadjusted Conversion Price shall be recorded in the securities account on an interim basis. In addition, a special note shall be made to the effect that the convertible claim according to the adjusted Conversion Price can carry the right to further shares. Final registration in the securities account shall occur after the adjusted Conversion Price has been established.
D. If the Borrower effects - with preferential rights for the shareholders and in return for cash payment or offset against a claim - an issue as referred to in Chapter 14 or 15 of the Swedish Companies Act, the provision in sub-section C, first paragraph, 1 and 2, shall apply correspondingly to the right of shares issued upon Conversion to participate in such issue.
In connection with Conversion effected on a date such that rights to participate in the issue do not accrue, an adjusted Conversion Price shall apply. The adjustment shall be made by the Conversion Agent in accordance with the following formula:
adjusted
previous Conversion Price x average
