If public notice has been given in accordance with that stated above in this sub section, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13 above with respect to the earliest date to request Conversion, the Bondholders shall have the right to request Conversion up to and including the closing date. At least four (4) weeks prior to the closing date, the Borrower shall remind the Bondholders of this right and also remind them that Conversion may not be requested after the closing date. In addition, the Bondholders shall be reminded in this notification of their right to demand immediate payment in accordance with that stated in the preceding paragraph.
O. In the event of the Borrower going into bankruptcy, Conversion may not be requested from that point onwards. If, however, the bankruptcy decision is revoked by a higher court of law, Conversion may again be requested.
14.2 The Borrower undertakes to consult with the Loan Trustee well in advance before the Company takes such measures as are described in Clause 14.1 above.
The Borrower further undertakes not to take any measures described in Clause 14.1 above, if they would result in a recalculation of the Conversion Price to an amount less than the quota value of one Share in the Borrower.
14.3 If the application of the terms and conditions contained in Clause 14.1 A - O leads to a result that is less favourable to the Bondholders than what is customary in the Norwegian bond market then the Board of Directors of the Borrower shall agree with the Loan Trustee on such changes in the application thereof as may be necessary to reach a result that is in line with the application of corresponding adjustment clauses in the Norwegian bond market, even if this results in a higher amount of Shares to be issued.
