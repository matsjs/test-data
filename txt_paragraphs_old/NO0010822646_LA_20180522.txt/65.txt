(ii) incur any additional Financial Indebtedness under the exception in paragraph (c) of the definition of Permitted Financial Indebtedness (as the same may be amended in accordance with paragraph (b) above ).
unless the Issuer is compliant with the Surviving Incurrence Test.
For the purpose of paragraph (b)(i) above if, after the incurrence of the initial Qualifying Debt, the Issuer (or another Group Company) issues any other Qualifying Debt (the "New Qualifying Debt"), the Bond Trustee may (by written notice to the Issuer) determine that the financial covenants in the New Qualifying Debt shall replace the financial covenants in this Bond Agreement at that point in time and for the duration of the New Qualifying Debt. For the avoidance of doubt, the Bond Trustee may not determine that only some, but not all, of the financial covenants shall be replaced, and if, after the Bond Trustee has made such determination, such New Qualifying Debt is discharged in full, the financial covenants from the initial Qualifying Debt shall again apply.
The Surviving Incurrence Test shall be in addition to any incurrence test and/or requirement regarding the same type of transactions in the finance documents governing any Qualifying Debt.
The Bond Trustee shall be irrevocably authorized to enter into such amendments agreements and/or other documents that it may deem necessary in order to implement the amendments to this Bond Agreement required in connection with the above.
