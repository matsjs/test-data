The Trustee shall not be considered to have acted negligently if it has acted in accordance with advice from or opinions of reputable external experts or if the Tmstee has acted with reasonable care in a situation when the Trustee considers that it is detrimental to the interests of the Bondholders to delay the action in order to first obtain instructions from the Bondholders.
The Trustee shall not be liable for any delay (or any related consequences) in crediting an account with an amount required pursuant to the Finance Documents to be paid by the Trustee to the Bondholders, provided that the Trustee has taken all necessary steps as soon as reasonably practicable to comply with the regulations or operating procedures of any recognised clearing or settlement system used by the Trustee for that purpose.
The Trustee shall have no liability to the Bondholders for damage caused by the Tmstee acting in accordance with instructions of or a demand by the Bondholders given in accordance with the Finance Documents.
Any liability towards the Issuer which is incurred by the Tmstee in acting under, or in relation to, the Finance Documents shall not be subject to set-off against the obligations of the Issuer to the Bondholders under the Finance Documents.

Subject to Clause 20.4.6, if the Trustee is Insolvent, the Tmstee shall be deemed to resign as Trustee and the Issuer shall within ten (10) Business Days appoint a successor Tmstee which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable company which regularly acts as Tmstee under debt issuances.
