(e) receivables sold or discounted (other than any receivables to the extent they are sold on a non-recourse basis);
(g) any derivative transaction entered into in connection with protection against or benefit from fluctuation in any rate or price (and, when calculating the value of any derivative transaction, only the mark to market value shall be taken into account); and
(h) the amount of any liability in respect of any guarantee or indemnity for any of the items referred to in paragraphs (a) to (g) above.
"Financial Statements" means the audited unconsolidated and consolidated annual financial statements of the Issuer for any financial year, drawn up according to GAAP, such accounts to include a profit and loss account, balance sheet, cash flow statement and report from the Board of Directors.
"Fishing Licenses" means any fishing license(s) relating to a Group Fishing Vessel.
"GAAP" means the generally accepted accounting practice and principles in the country in which the Issuer is incorporated including, if applicable, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and guidelines and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (or any predecessor and successor thereof), in force from time to time.
To the extent that the Issuer elects or is required to conform its periodical financial reports with the requirements of the IAS/IFRS regulations and such guidelines and standards as shall be recommended from time to time by the International Accounting Standards Board, or if there have been made any material changes to IFRS or Norwegian GAAP or the interpretation of such accounting principles, the Issuer and the Bond Trustee will conduct a review of the impact thereof on the Issuer's consolidated financial statements. Amendments shall be made to the financial covenants (if necessary) in order to enable the Bond Trustee to apply thereunder the same financial tests as set forth in Clause 13.5 as the Bond Trustee would have been able to do had the Issuer continued to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with otherwise applicable Norwegian accounting principles. The Bond Trustee may ask any well reputed accountancy firm or investment bank to assist in the determination and may rely solely on such determination without a duty to examine the merits of the determination.
