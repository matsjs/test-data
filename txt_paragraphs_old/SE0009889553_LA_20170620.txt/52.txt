Redemption in accordance with Clauses 11.3.1 and 11.3.2 shall be made by the Issuer giving not less than fifteen (15) Business Days' notice to the Holders and the Agent. Any such notice shall state the Redemption Date and the relevant Record Date and is irrevocable but may, at the Issuer's discretion, contain one or more conditions precedent. Upon expiry of such notice and the fulfilment of the conditions precedent (if any), the Issuer is bound to redeem the Bonds in full at the applicable amounts.
Voluntary partial prepayment

Any such partial repayment shall reduce the Nominal Amount of each Bond pro rata (rounded down to the nearest SEK 1.00). The repayment must occur on an Interest Payment Date and the Issuer shall give not less than twenty (20) Business Days' notice o f the repayment to the Agent and the Holders.
Equity claw back
The Issuer may at one occasion, in connection with an Equity Listing Event, repay up to thirty-five (35.00) per cent, of the aggregate Initial Nominal Amount (provided that at least sixty-five (65.00) per cent, of the aggregate Initial Nominal Amount remains outstanding after such repayment), in which case all outstanding Bonds shall be partially repaid by way of reducing the Nominal Amount of each Bond pro rata (rounded down to the nearest SEK 1.00).
The repayment must occur on an Interest Payment Date within one hundred and eighty (180) days after such Equity Listing Event and be made with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the cash proceeds received by the Issuer or another Group Company as a result of such Equity Listing Event (net of fees, charges and commissions actually incurred in connection with such Equity Listing Event and net of taxes paid or payable as a result of such Equity Listing Event).
