Meeting) and 21 (Written Procedure), the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds
terminated and enforce the Transaction Security. The Agent is however not liable to take action if the Agent considers cause for termination and/or acceleration not to be at hand, unless the instructing Holders in writing commit to holding the Agent indemnified and, at the Agent's own discretion, grant sufficient security for the obligation.
Funds that the Agent receives (directly or indirectly) on behalf of the Holders in connection with the termination of the Bonds or the enforcement of any or all of the Transaction Security constitute escrow funds (Sw. redovisningsmedel) according to the Escrow Funds Act (Sw. lag (1944:181) om redovisningsmedel) and must be held on a separate interest bearing account on behalf of the Holders and any other interested party. The Agent shall promptly arrange for payments to be made to the Holders in such case. The Agent shall arrange for payments of such funds in accordance with Clause 18 (Distribution o fproceeds) as soon as reasonably practicable. If the Agent deems it appropriate, it may, in accordance with Clause 5.8, instruct the CSD to arrange for payment to the Holders.
For the purpose of exercising the rights of the Holders and the Agent under these Terms and Conditions and for the purpose of distributing any funds originating from the enforcement of any Transaction Security, the Issuer irrevocably authorises and empowers the Agent to act in the name of the Issuer, and on behalf of the Issuer, to instruct the CSD to arrange for payment to the Holders in accordance with Clause 5.7. To the extent permissible by law, the powers set out in this Clause 5.8 are irrevocable and shall be valid for as long as any Bonds remain outstanding. The Issuer shall immediately upon request by the Agent provide the Agent with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance to the Agent's satisfaction), which the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of carrying out its duties under Clause 5.7 (including as required by the CSD in order for the CSD to accept such payment instructions). Especially, the Issuer shall, upon the Agent's request, provide the Agent with a written power of attorney empowering the Agent to change the bank account registered with the CSD to a bank account in the name of the Agent and to instruct the CSD to pay out funds originating from an enforcement in accordance with Clause 5.7 to the Holders through the CSD.
