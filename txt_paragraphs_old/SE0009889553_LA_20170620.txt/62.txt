The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of the Subsidiaries, sell or otherwise dispose of shares in any Group Company or of all or substantially all of its or any Group Company's assets or operations to any Person not being the Issuer or any of the wholly-owned Subsidiaries, unless the transaction (taken as a whole also taking into account any transaction ancillary or related thereto) is carried out at fair market value and on terms and conditions customary for such transaction and provided that the transaction does not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Issuer shall notify the Agent of any such transaction and, upon request by the Agent, provide the Agent with any information relating to the transaction which the Agent deems necessary (acting reasonably). Notwithstanding the above, a Group Company may not dispose of shares which have been pledged in order to secure the obligations under the Finance Documents unless the Agent has provided its prior approval.

Such Security shall be granted immediately on the date of the acquisition unless such would contradict any rules on financial assistance set out in Chapter 21 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. Aktiebolagslagen) (or equivalent in any other applicable jurisdiction) whereby the Issuer is only obliged to ensure that the relevant Group Company complies with this paragraph three (3) months after the relevant acquisition date (or in accordance with the rules and regulations of any other applicable jurisdiction).
