G. If the Borrower's share capital should be reduced through a repayment to its shareholders, and the reduction is compulsory, an adjusted Conversion Price shall be applied. The adjustment shall be made by the Conversion Agent in accordance with the following formula:
previous Conversion Price x average market price of the Shares during a period of 25 trading days beginning on the date when the shares were quoted without repayment rights (average share price)
average share price increased by the amount being repaid per Share
The average share price shall be calculated as stated in sub-section C above.
When making adjustment in accordance with the above, where the reduction is carried out through a redemption of shares, instead of using the actual amount which is repaid for each Share, an amount calculated as follows shall be applied:
calculated amount to be repaid for each share =
the actual amount repaid for each redeemed Share reduced by the average market price of the Shares during a period of 25 trading days immediately prior to the day on which the Shares were quoted without rights to participate in the reduction (average share price)
the number of shares of the Company which underlie the redemption of one Share reduced by 1
The average share price shall be calculated as stated in sub-section C above.
