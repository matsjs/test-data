14. Adjustment of the Conversion Price
14.1 The following shall apply with respect to the rights of Bondholders in the situations described below. Immediately after such recalculation the Conversion Agent shall send a notice regarding the recalculated amount to the Borrower and the Loan Trustee.
A. If the Borrower effects a bonus issue of shares, Conversion requested on a date that does not permit it to be effected prior to or on the tenth calendar day preceding the General Meeting of Shareholders held to approve the issue will not be effected until after the Meeting has approved the issue. Shares issued upon Conversions effected following approval of the bonus issue shall be entered in the account on an interim basis and shall not be entitled to participate in the issue. Final registration of such shares in the securities account takes place after the record date for the bonus issue.
In connection with Conversions effected following approval of the bonus issue, an adjusted Conversion Price shall be applicable. The adjustment is made by the Conversion Agent in accordance with the following formula:
adjusted Conversion Price = previous Conversion Price x number of shares prior to bonus
