The value of the purchase right shall be considered to correspond to the average of the mean of the highest and lowest prices paid for such rights on each trading day in transactions as recorded in the the Market Place's official list of prices during the subscription period. In the absence of a quotation of a paid price, the last bid price quoted shall be included in the calculation.
