11.7.3
(b) the Interest Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.25.
For the purpose of curing a deficiency in the ratio referred to under Clause 11.7.1(b) above, the Issuer shall after the expiry of each Relevant Period have the right to reduce the Interest Expense for the purpose of the calculation of the ratio of the Interest Coverage Ratio for such Relevant Period (an "Equity Cure"), provided that (i) prior to the Equity Cure, the Interest Coverage Ratio is not below 1.00 and (ii) the amount used to reduce the Interest Expense is at least 10,000,000 SEK (the "Cure Amount") and shall be obtained in cash by the Issuer:
(a) before the delivery of the Compliance Certificate relating to the expired Relevant Period; and
(b) as (i) new share capital, (ii) unconditional shareholders' contribution or (iii) Shareholder Loans.
When re-calculating the Interest Expense in relation to the Interest Coverage Ratio pursuant to an Equity Cure, the Interest Expense shall be reduced by an amount corresponding to the amount with which the Interest Expense would have been reduced if the Cure Amount was applied towards a SEK by SEK reduction of the Net Interest Bearing Debt for the entire Relevant Period calculated pro forma and, when making the SEK by SEK reduction, based on the weighted average (blended rate) Interest Expense for the Net Interest Bearing Debt for such period. For the avoidance of doubt, such pro forma calculation may be included when calculating the Interest Expense for subsequent Relevant Periods having overlapping interim periods with the Relevant Period which first included the pro forma calculation, however only taking into account such overlapping interim periods.
The Cure Amount shall be applied towards repayment of the Bonds. Such repayment shall be at the Nominal Amount pro rata to each Bond and shall be made at the nearest Interest Payment Date after which the Cure Amount has been obtained by the Issuer. The repayment of the Bonds shall be made by the Issuer giving not less than fifteen (15) Business Days' notice to the Holders and the Agent, where such notice shall state the relevant Interest Payment Date on which the repayment shall be made, the prepayment amount and the relevant Record Date.
Only one (1) Equity Cure is allowed during a 12 month period and only two (2) Equity Cures may occur in aggregate prior to the Final Maturity Date.
