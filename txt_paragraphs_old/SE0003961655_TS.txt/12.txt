PURCHASE AND TRANSFER OF NOTES
The distribution of these terms and conditions and the offering, sale and delivery of the Notes in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law.
The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the US Securities Act and, subject to certain exceptions, may not be offered or sold within the United States. The Bookrunner has agreed that it will not offer or sell the Notes within the United States as part of its distribution at any time.
In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by any dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the US Securities Act.
