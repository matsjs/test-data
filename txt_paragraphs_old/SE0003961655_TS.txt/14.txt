In the event a party which has received amounts in accordance with the above provision is not entitled to receive such payment, the Issuer and Euroclear Sweden shall be deemed to have performed their relevant obligations. The above-stated shall not apply, however, where the Issuer or Euroclear Sweden was aware that the sum was improperly paid or where the Issuer or Euroclear Sweden failed to exercise normal caution. ^
§7
EARLY REDEMPTION
If an Early Redemption Event has occurred each Noteholder shall have the option to request redemption of the Notes at a purchase price of 101 per cent, of its Nominal Amount together with accrued interest within 90 days of being given notice in accordance with Clause 13 (Notices) by the Issuer that a change of control which constitutes a put event has occurred. Redemption following such request shall fall 180 days after the notice of such Early Redemption Event is given by the Issuer.
An "Early Redemption Event" shall be deemed to have occurred, if, after the Issue Date, any person or group of persons acting in concert gains control of the Issuer.
For the purpose of this Clause "control" means:
(a) the power (whether by way of ownership of shares, proxy, contract, agency or otherwise) to: (i) cast, or control the casting of, more than fifty per cent. (50%) of the maximum number of votes that can be cast at a general meeting of the shareholders of the Issuer; or (ii) appoint or remove all, or the majority, of the directors or other equivalent officers of the Issuer; or (iii) give directions with respect to the operating and financial policies of the Issuer which the directors or other equivalent officers of the Issuer are obliged to comply with; or
(b) the holding of more than fifty per cent. (50%) of the issued share capital of the Issuer (excluding any part of that issued share capital that carries no right to participate beyond a specified amount in a distribution of either profits or capital).
"Acting in concert" means, a group of persons who, pursuant to an agreement or understanding (whether formal or informal), actually co-operate, through the acquisition by any of them, either directly or indirectly, of shares in the Issuer, to obtain or consolidate control of the Issuer.
