The nominal amount of each Initial Note is SEK 1,000,000 (the "Nominal Amount"). The aggregate maximum nominal amount of the Initial Notes as at the First Issue Date is SEK 800,000,000. All Initial Notes are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 98.50 percent, of the Initial Nominal Amount.
Provided that no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue, the Issuer may, on one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Notes. Subsequent Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate, the currency, the nominal amount and the final maturity applicable to the Initial Notes shall apply to Subsequent Notes. The issue price of the Subsequent Notes may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal Amount. The maximum aggregate nominal amount of the Notes (the Initial Notes and all Subsequent Notes) may not exceed SEK 1,000,000,000. Each Subsequent Note shall entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with Clause 9 {Interest), and otherwise have the same rights as the Initial Notes

preferred by mandatory law and except as otherwise provided in the Finance
