Clause 25.1 shall not apply if the Agent has been instructed by the Noteholders in accordance with the Finance Documents to take certain actions but fails for any reason to take, or is unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a Noteholder to provide documents in accordance with Clause 22.1.2), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under the Finance Documents or the Agency Agreement or by any reason described in Clause 22.2.11, such failure must continue for at least forty (40) Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 22.2.8 before a Noteholder may take any action referred to in Clause 25.1.
The provisions of Clause 25.1 shall not in any way limit an individual Noteholder's right to claim and enforce payments which are due to it under Clause 10.5 (Mandatory repurchase due to a Change of Control Event or Listing Failure Event (put option)) or other payments which are due by the Issuer to some but not all Noteholders.
