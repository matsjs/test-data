If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it under the Terms and Conditions on
its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from (but excluding)
the due date up to (and including) the date of actual payment at a rate which is two (2)
per cent, higher than the interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be
capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely
attributable to the Agent or the CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply
instead.
