Execution copy
The Issuer shall not engage in, or permit any member of the Group to engage in, directly or indirectly, any transaction with any party (without limitation, the purchase, sale or exchange of assets or the rendering of any service), except in the ordinary course of business and pursuant to the reasonable requirement of the Issuer's or such member of the Group's business and upon fair and reasonable terms that are no less favourable to the Issuer or such member of the Group, as the case may be, than those which might be obtained in an arm's length transaction at the time.
Preservation of equity and Financial Covenants
(a) Dividends and other distributions The Issuer shall not within a calendar year declare or make any dividend payments or other distributions or loans to its shareholders - whether in cash or in kind - including without limitation repurchase of shares, any total return swaps or instruments with similar effect and reductions in its share capital or equity (but always excluding distributions of bonus shares not affecting its equity) that constitutes more than 50% of (on a consolidated basis based on last Financial Statements) the Issuer's net profit after taxes for the previous financial year. Any un-realized portion of the permitted distribution may not be carried forward. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall be in compliance with its covenants immediately after declaration of and distribution of any such dividends.
(b) Minimum Equity Ratio The Issuer shall ensure that the Group maintains an Equity Ratio of minimum 25.00%. The Equity Ratio shall apply at all times but will be tested, and reported to the Bond Trustee, quarterly in connection with the Issuer's quarterly reporting.
