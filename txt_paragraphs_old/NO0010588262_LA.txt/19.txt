5.2
Bondholders may be subject to purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Bonds, as
applicable from time to time under local laws to which a Bondholder may be subject (due e.g. to
its nationality, its residency, its registered address, its place(s) for doing business). Each
Bondholder must ensure compliance with local laws and regulations applicable at own cost and
expense.
