STATUS OF THE BONDS AND SECURITY
8.1 Status and ranking
8.1.1 The Bonds shall constitute senior debt obligations of the Issuer and rank at least pari passu with all other obligations of the Issuer (save for such claims which are preferred by bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or other similar laws of general application) and shall rank ahead of subordinated debt of the Issuer.
8.1.2 The Bonds, including accrued but unpaid interest, costs and expenses, shall be secured by the Security Interest.
8.1.3 In the event that the Issuer and/or the Parent acquires (through purchase, subscription or otherwise) additional shares of Deep Sea Metro, the Issuer and/or the Parent shall promptly upon receipt ensure that such shares be pledged on first priority as an integral part of the Deep Sea Metro Share Pledge, provided that at any time the maximum number of Deep Sea Metro's shares subject to the Deep Sea Metro Share Pledge shall not exceed 60 per cent of the current issued and outstanding share capital of Deep Sea Metro from time to time. In the event that any further Intra-Group Loans are granted by the Parent, the Parent and the Issuer shall ensure that such loans, in line with the existing Intra-Group Loans, are promptly pledged on a 1st priority basis and assigned, subordinated and subject to release rights in accordance with Clause 13.5.3. The Parent and the Issuer shall procure that legal opinions in respect of any such additional security are provided to the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders), such legal opinions to include, inter alia, confirmations on capacity, validity, perfection and enforceability of such additional security (in form and content satisfactory to the Bond Trustee), together with any such other relevant documents, evidence and confirmations as the Bond Trustee may reasonably require.
