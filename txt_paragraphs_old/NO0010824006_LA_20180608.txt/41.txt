If, by reason of the entry into force of IFRS 16, a change on how the Issuer recognises its rights and obligations under any lease in the Issuer's financial statements (the "Accounting Change") will affect the calculation or result of the Equity Ratio test compared to the calculation and result at the Issue Date, the calculation of the Equity Ratio will be adjusted accordingly to take into account the effects of such Accounting Change as evidenced by the Issuer and to the satisfaction of the Bond Trustee so that the Bondholders will continue to benefit from an Equity Ratio covenant substantially equivalent to that agreed prior to the said Accounting Change.
