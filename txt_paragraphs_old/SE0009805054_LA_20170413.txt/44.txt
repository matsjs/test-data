(c) that, upon any Subsequent Bond Issue, the volume of Bonds listed on the relevant Regulated Market promptly, and not later than ten (10) Business Days after the relevant Issue Date, is increased accordingly.
The Issuer shall procure that no substantial change is made to the general nature of the business as carried out by the Group on the First Issue Date.
Market Loans
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of the Subsidiaries, (i) issue any Market Loan that has a final redemption date or, when applicable, early redemption dates or instalment dates which occur before the Final Redemption Date (for the avoidance of doubt, this does not apply to bonds constituting Existing Bonds), or (ii) repurchase any Market Loan as long as Existing Bonds are outstanding (except if the Issuer has an obligation to do so pursuant to these Terms and Conditions).
Maintenance Test
The Issuer shall ensure that the Maintenance Test is met as long as any Bond is outstanding.
