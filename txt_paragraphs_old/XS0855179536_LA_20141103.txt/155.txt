the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the
deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may
be.
In addition, the Company must deliver an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).
Judgment Currency
Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in U.S. dollars or euro, as the case may be, which is made to or for the account of any holder of the Notes or the Trustee in lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the "Judgment Currency'"), whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the liquidation of the Company or any Guarantor, shall constitute a discharge of the Company or the Guarantor's obligation under the Indenture, the Notes, and the Guarantees, as the case may be, only to the extent of the amount of U.S. dollars or euro, as the case may be, with such holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, could purchase in the London foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Judgment Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first Business Day following receipt of the payment in the Judgment Currency. If the amount of U.S. dollars or euro, as the case may be, that could be so purchased is less than the amount of U.S. dollars or euro, as the case may be, originally due to such holder of the Notes or the Trustee, as the case may be, the Company and the Guarantors shall indemnify and hold harmless the holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, from and against all loss or damage arising out of, or as a result of, such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in the Indenture or the Notes, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any holder of the Notes or the Trustee from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.
