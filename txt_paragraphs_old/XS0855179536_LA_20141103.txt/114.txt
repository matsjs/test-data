Impairment of Security Interest
The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of Notes and the Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Parallel Intercreditor Agreement and (b) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted Collateral Liens; and providedfurther, however, that no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced, or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, renewal or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the assets), the Company delivers to the Trustee either (1) a solvency opinion from an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee confirming the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, (2) a certificate from the board of directors or chief financial officer of the relevant Person (acting in good faith) that confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, replacement, supplement, modification or release, or (3) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes created under the Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced or released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, and that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking.
At the direction of the Company and without the consent of the holder of Notes, the Security Agent may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security Documents to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (ii) (but subject to compliance with the foregoing paragraph) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens, (iii) add to the Collateral or (iv) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of Notes in any material respect.
