(2)
all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
(3)
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer's
Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the
Company.
The Principal Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of the Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any. The Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.
The provisions described above that require the Company to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a holder of Notes' right to require the Company to repurchase such holder's Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Company or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.
