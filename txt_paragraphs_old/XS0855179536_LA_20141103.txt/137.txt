No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders
No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any Guarantor, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of the Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under applicable securities laws.
