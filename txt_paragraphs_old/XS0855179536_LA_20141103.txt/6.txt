Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the "Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to Persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under "Notice to Investors." In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.
Any Book-Entry Interest (as defined under "Book-Entry, Delivery and Form") that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued for the Dollar Senior Secured Notes only in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, and for the Euro Senior Secured Notes only in minimum denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the applicable Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Company in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under "Notice to Investors."
Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Dollar Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and Euro Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof, to Persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream where appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions and pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange; provided that, if the Company or any Guarantor is a party to the transfer or exchange, the holder will not be required to pay such Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive Registered Notes:
(1)
for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;
(2)
for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;
