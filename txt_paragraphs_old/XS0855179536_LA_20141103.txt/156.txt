Concerning the Trustee
The Company shall deliver written notice to the Trustee within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default. If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Company or any Guarantor, the Indenture limits the right of the Trustee to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee.
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of the Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security, and the Trustee has received, and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.
The Company and the Guarantors will indemnify the Trustee for certain claims, liabilities and expenses incurred without fraud, negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with its duties.
