any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Company or Guarantor to the holder if such
the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payments had such holder been the sole
beneficial owner of such Note; or
(9)
any combination of items (1) through (8) above.
In addition to the foregoing, the Company and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Guarantee or any other document referred to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes other than the initial resale by the initial purchasers) or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited, solely in the case of taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (5) above or any combination thereof), or any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Notes or any Guarantee.
If the Company or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, each of the Company or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the Company or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer's Certificate must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
The Company or the relevant Guarantor will make or cause to be made all withholdings and deductions required by law and will timely remit or cause to be remitted the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Company or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Company or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Company or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. If requested by the Trustee, the Company or the Guarantors will provide to the Trustee such information as may be in the possession of the Company or the Guarantors (and not otherwise in the possession of the Trustee) to enable the Trustee to determine the amount of withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder, provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or the Guarantors be required to disclose any information that it reasonably deems to be confidential.
Whenever in the Indenture or in this "Description of the Senior Secured Notes" there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or any Guarantee or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
