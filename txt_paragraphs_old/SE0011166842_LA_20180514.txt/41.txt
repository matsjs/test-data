In addition, the Company may, and shall upon request, disclose information from the Debt Register to a Noteholder in relation to matters that may require consent of Noteholders representing at least 66 2/3 per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount as set out in Clause 15.5.
If any person other than a Noteholder wishes to exercise any rights under the Finance Documents, it must obtain a power of attorney or other proof of authorisation from the Noteholder or a successive, coherent chain of powers of attorney or proofs of authorisation starting with the Noteholder and authorising such person.
A Noteholder may issue one or several powers of attorney to third parties to represent it in relation to some or all of the Notes held by it. Any such representative may act independently under the Finance Documents in relation to the Notes for which such representative is entitled to represent the Noteholder and may further delegate its right to represent the Noteholder by way of a further power of attorney.
