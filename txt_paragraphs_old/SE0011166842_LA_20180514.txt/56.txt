The Issuer shall immediately notify the Noteholders and the Agent upon becoming aware of the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, Listing Failure or De-Listing Event, and shall provide the Agent with such further information as the Agent may reasonably request following receipt of such notice.
The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Agent and the Noteholders according to this Clause 10.1 if informing the Agent or the Noteholders would not conflict with any applicable laws, rules or regulations (including rules issued by the MTF or Regulated Market where the shares in the Issuer are listed or where the Notes will be listed). If such conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with the Regulated Market or otherwise, the Issuer shall be obliged to either seek approval from the Regulated Market or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non disclosure agreement with the Agent, in order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to this Clause 10.1.
Compliance Certificate
The Issuer shall submit a Compliance Certificate to the Agent in connection with:
a) a Restricted Payment that requires the Incurrence Test to be met;
b) the incurrence of Financial Indebtedness that requires the Incurrence Test to be met; and
c) when financial statements are made available to the Noteholders pursuant to Clause 10.1.1 a) and b).
Information from the Agent
Subject to the restrictions of a non-disclosure agreement entered into by the Agent in accordance with Clause 10.1.5 and restrictions of any applicable law and regulation the Agent is entitled to disclose to the Noteholders any event or circumstance directly or indirectly relating to the Issuer or the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agent may, if it considers it to be beneficial to the interests of the Noteholders, delay disclosure or refrain from disclosing certain information other than in respect of an Event of Default that has occurred and is continuing.
