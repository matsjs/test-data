(i) the present value on the relevant record date of 107.00% of the par value of such Bonds discounted from the Interest Payment Date falling 12 months after the Issue Date; and
(ii) the present value on the relevant record date of the remaining interest payments in respect of such Bonds (less any accrued but unpaid interest, as such interest shall be paid in full) through and including the Interest Payment Date falling 12 months after the Issue Date;
both calculated by using a discount rate of 50 basis points over the comparable U.S. Treasury Rate (i.e. comparable to the remaining duration of the Bonds until the mentioned Interest Payment Date falling 12 months after the Issue Date) (plus accrued interest on the redeemed amount). The "relevant record date" shall mean a date agreed upon between the Bond Trustee, the Paying Agent, VPS and the Issuer in connection with the such repayment;
(b) if such event occurs anytime from and including the Interest Payment Date falling 12 months after the Issue Date to, but not including, the Interest Payment Date falling 24 months after the Issue Date, the redemption price shall be equal to 107.00% of par value (ptus accrued interest on the redeemed Bonds); and
(c) if the Relevant Disposal or Refinance Event occurs at any time at which the Issuer would be entitled to redeem some or all of the Bonds pursuant to the Issuer's Call Options, the redemption price shall equal the price which would have applied to exercise thereof on the same date (plus accrued interest on the redeemed Bonds).
For the avoidance of doubt, the redemption prices in (a) through (c) above shall be determined based on the date the Mandatory Repayment Event occurred and not based on the date of repayment.
10.3.2
Upon a Total Loss Event, the Issuer shall promptly once insurance proceeds are available to it, but in any event no later than 120 days following the Total Loss Event (subject to the Vessel Replacement Option (as described below)), redeem Outstanding Bonds equivalent to the Redemption Amount at 100% of par value (plus accrued interest on the redeemed Bonds).
