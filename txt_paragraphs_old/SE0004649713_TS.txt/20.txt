7 Redemption of the Bonds and payments
The Company shall redeem all outstanding Bonds at the Nominal Amount on the Final Redemption Date. Payment of the Nominal Amount and interest will be made to the person who is a Holder on the Record Date.
7.2 Payments of principal and interest
If a Holder has registered, through an Account Operator, that capital and interest shall be paid to a designated bank account, such payment will be effected by the CSD on the relevant payment date. In other cases, payments will be transferred by the CSD to the Holder at the address registered with the CSD on the Record Date. If a day on which an amount becomes due and payable is not a Banking Day the amount will be deposited or transferred the next following Banking Day. However, interest only accrues up to and including the relevant due date.

Should the CSD, due to a delay on behalf of the Company or some other obstacle, not be able to effect the payment of amounts according to the aforesaid, the CSD will pay such amount to the Holders as soon as possible after such obstacle has been removed. Payment will be made to the person registered as Holder on the Record Date immediately preceding the actual payment date.
If a person to whom payment has been made in accordance with the above was not entitled to receive such payment, the Company and the CSD shall nevertheless be deemed to have fulfilled their obligations, provided that the Company and/or the CSD did not have knowledge that such payment was made to a person not entitled to receive such amount and provided that the Company and/or the CSD acted with normal care.

Accrued default interest shall not be capitalized.
