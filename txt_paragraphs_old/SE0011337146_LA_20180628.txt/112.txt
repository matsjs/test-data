25. APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THE AGENT
25.1 Appointment of Agent
25.1.1
By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Holder appoints the Agent to act as its agent in all matters relating to the Bonds and the Finance Documents, and authorises the Agent to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent, unless such consent is specifically required by the Finance Documents) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Bonds held by such Holder, including the winding-up, dissolution, liquidation, company reorganisation (Sw.fdretagsrekonstruktion) or bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction) of the Issuer. By acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Holder confirms such appointment and authorisation for the Agent to act on its behalf.
25.1.2 The Agent is not acting as an advisor (whether legal, financial or otherwise) to the Holders.
25.1.3
Each Holder shall immediately upon request by the Agent provide the Agent with any such documents, including a written power of attorney, as the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents. The Agent is under no obligation to represent a Holder which does not comply with such request.
