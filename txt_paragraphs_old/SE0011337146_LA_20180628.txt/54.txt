6.4 No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden, where action for that purpose is required. Each Holder must inform itself about, and observe, any applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds, (due to, e.g., its nationality, its residency, its registered address or its place(s) of business). Each Holder must ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.
The Bonds have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act") and the Issuer is under no obligation to arrange for registration of the Bonds
under the Securities Act or under any other law or regulation. The Bonds may not be offered,
sold or delivered within the United States of America or to, or for the account or benefit of,
U.S. persons.
6.6 For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the above, a Holder which allegedly has purchased Bonds in contradiction to mandatory restrictions applicable may (other than in respect of any Bonds purchased in violation of Clause 7.1 {Right o f First Refusal)) nevertheless utilise its voting rights under these Terms and Conditions and shall be entitled to exercise its full rights as a Holder hereunder in each case until such allegations have been resolved.
