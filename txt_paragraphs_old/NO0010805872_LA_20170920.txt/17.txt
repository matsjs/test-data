where the present value shall be calculated by using a discount rate of 50 basis points above the comparable Government Bond Rate (i.e. comparable to the remaining Macaulay duration of the Bonds from the Call Option Repayment Date until the First Call Date using linear interpolation), and where the interest rate applied for the remaining interest payments shall equal the Mid-Swap Rate plus the Margin (however so that the interest rate can never fall below the Margin).
"Management Agreements" means any agreement from time to time entered into with the Vessel Managers for technical and operational management of the Vessels, which shall be on market terms and with customary termination and subordination provisions, provided that no subordination is required if a Vessel Manager is a non-related entity.
