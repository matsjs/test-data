The person requesting the decision may suggest the form for decision making, but if it is in the Trustee's opinion more appropriate that a matter is dealt with at a Bondholders' Meeting than by way of a Written Procedure, it shall be dealt with at a Bondholders' Meeting.
(d) Should the Trustee not convene a Bondholders' Meeting or instigate a Written Procedure in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, without Clause 16(c) being applicable, the Issuer or the Bondholder(s) requesting a decision by the Bondholders may convene such Bondholders' Meeting or instigate such Written Procedure, as the case may be, instead.

(i) on the Business Day specified in the notice pursuant to Clause 17(b) of the Bondholders' Meeting, or
(ii) on the Business Day specified in the communication pursuant to Clause 18(b), in respect of a Written Procedure,

Such Business Day specified pursuant to paragraph (i) or (ii) above must fall no earlier than one (1) Business Day after the effective date of the notice or communication, as the case may be.
(g) The following matters shall require the consent of Bondholders representing at least sixty-six and two thirds (66 2/3) per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Bondholders are voting at a Bondholders' Meeting or for which Bondholders reply in a Written Procedure in accordance with the instructions given pursuant to Clause 18(b):
