(ii) The Issuer shall not make any material change to the general nature or scope of its business from that carried on at the date of this Bond Agreement, or as contemplated by this Bond Agreement.
The Issuer shall not be entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of all or a substantial part of its assets (including but not limited to the FPSO) or operations in connection with a sale to a third party or an internal reorganisation, unless the Outstanding Bonds are redeemed in accordance with Clause 10.4 (Mandatory Redemption), provided always that any such sales or disposals shall be permitted:
(i) in order for the Issuer to keep the FPSO in good, safe and efficient state of repair;
(ii) in connection with any required modifications to the FPSO; and
(iii) where a material part of the FPSO is removed, provided that the part so removed is replaced promptly by a suitable part or item, which upon installation becomes the property of the Issuer and subject to a security interest in favour of the Trustee.
Transactions with shareholders, directors and affiliated companies
(i) The Issuer shall not engage directly or indirectly in any transaction with any Group Company (including without limitation any purchase, sale or exchange of assets or the rendering of any service) except in the ordinary course of business and pursuant to the reasonable requirements of the Issuer's business and upon fair and reasonable terms customary for such transactions that are not less favourable to the Issuer than those which might be obtained in an arm's length transaction at the time, and so that no payment under any such transaction may be deferred in a way that would constitute a Financial Indebtedness,
(ii) All such transactions shall comply with all applicable provisions of applicable corporate law applicable to such transactions.
