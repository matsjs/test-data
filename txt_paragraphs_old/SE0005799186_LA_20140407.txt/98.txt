23. NO DIRECT ACTIONS BY HOLDERS
23.2 Clause 23.1 shall not apply if the Agent/Security Agent has been instructed by the Holders in accordance with the Finance Documents to take certain actions but fails for any reason to take, or is unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a Holder to provide documents in accordance with Clause 21.1.2), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent/Security Agent under the Finance Documents or by any reason described in Clause 21.2.9, such failure must continue for at least forty (40) Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 21.2.10 before a Holder may take any action referred to in Clause 23.1.
23.3 The provisions of Clause 23.1 shall not in any way limit an individual Holder's right to claim and enforce payments which are due by the Issuer to some but not all Holders.
