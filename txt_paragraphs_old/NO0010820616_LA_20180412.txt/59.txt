(d) for purposes of this Clause 13.8, the Security Agent acts in its own name and not as agent, representative or trustee of the Secured Parties and accordingly holds neither its claim resulting from a Parallel Liability nor any Transaction Security securing a Parallel Liability on trust.
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that no Guarantor will, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of any legal or beneficial interest in any of its assets to any party not being an Obligor, other than:
(a) disposals of obsolete, worn out or redundant assets or equipment;
(b) disposals (excluding Producing Blocks as of the Issue Date) where the asset is replaced with a comparable asset;
(c) disposals of Hydrocarbon Licenses which are not Producing Blocks as of the Issue Date, provided that the proceeds or consideration from such disposal(s) is re-invested in Field Development Capex or, in case of a disposal in part, a reduction of the Obligors' exploration expenditures related to such part of the Hydrocarbon License being disposed of; or
(d) disposals in the ordinary course of business (not including Hydrocarbon Licenses),
subject in each case under (a) to (d) to the transaction being on arm's length terms, at fair market value, on terms and conditions customary for such transaction, and which do not have a Material Adverse Effect.
