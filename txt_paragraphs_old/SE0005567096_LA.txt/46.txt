Holders). If the Holders vote in favour of termination and instruct the Agent to terminate the
Bonds, the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. However, if the cause for
termination according to the Agent's appraisal has ceased before the termination, the Agent
shall not terminate the Bonds. The Agent shall in such case, at the earliest possible date,
notify the Holders that the cause for termination has ceased. The Agent shall always be
entitled to take the time necessary to consider whether an occurred event constitutes an
Event of Default and whether such event has a Material Adverse Effect.
