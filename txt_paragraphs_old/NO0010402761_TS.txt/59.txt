Subject to, and as provided in these Conditions, the Conversion Right in respect of a Note may be exercised, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time (subject to any applicable fiscal or other laws or regulations and as hereinafter provided) from 30 January 2008 to the close of business (in the place where the specified office of the Paying and Conversion Agent is located) on the date falling six days prior to the Final Maturity Date (both days inclusive) or, if the Notes shall have been called for redemption pursuant to Condition 7(b) or 7(c) prior to the Final Maturity Date, then up to the close of business (at the place aforesaid) on the sixth day before the date fixed for redemption thereof pursuant to Condition 7(b) or 7(c), unless there shall be default in making payment in respect of such Note on such date fixed for redemption, in which event the Conversion Right shall extend up to the close of business (at the place aforesaid) on the date on which the full amount of such payment becomes available for payment and notice of such availability has been duly given in accordance with Condition 16 or, if earlier, the Final Maturity Date; provided that, in each case, if the final such date for the exercise of Conversion Rights is not a business day at the place aforesaid, then the period for exercise of the Conversion Right by Noteholders shall end on the immediately preceding business day at the place aforesaid.
Conversion Rights may not be exercised by a Noteholder in circumstances where the relevant Conversion Date would fall during the period commencing on the Record Date in respect of any payment of interest on the Notes and ending on the relevant Interest Payment Date (both days inclusive).
The period during which Conversion Rights may (subject as provided below) be exercised by a Noteholder is referred to as the "Conversion Period".
Conversion Rights may only be exercised in respect of an authorised denomination.
Fractions of Ordinary Shares will not be delivered on conversion or pursuant to Condition 6(c). However, the Issuer will make a cash payment to the relevant exercising Noteholder in respect of any such fraction equal to the product of the closing price of an Ordinary Share on the relevant Conversion Date as published by or derived from the Relevant Stock Exchange multiplied by such fraction and converted into U.S. dollars at the Prevailing Rate. Payment of any such amount

shall be made by transfer to a U.S. dollar account in New York as specified in the relevant Conversion Notice. If the Conversion Right in respect of more than one Note is exercised at any one time such that Ordinary Shares to be delivered on conversion or pursuant to Condition 6(c) are to be registered in the same name, the number of such Ordinary Shares to be delivered in respect thereof shall be calculated on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes being so converted and rounded down to the nearest whole number of Ordinary Shares.
The Issuer will procure that Ordinary Shares to be delivered or transferred on conversion will be delivered or transferred in electronic form to the holder of the Notes completing the relevant Conversion Notice or his nominee by entry with the VPS Account of such holder of the Notes or his nominee as soon as possible and on or about the relevant Delivery Date. Such Ordinary Shares will be deemed to be issued or delivered as of the relevant Delivery Date. The Issuer will procure that any Additional Ordinary Shares to be issued and delivered pursuant to Condition 6(c) will be deemed to be issued and delivered as of the date the relevant Retroactive Adjustment takes effect or as at the date of issue of Ordinary Shares if the adjustment results from the issue of Ordinary Shares (each such date, the "Reference Date").
Pursuant to Norwegian company law, no Ordinary Shares shall be deemed issued until (i) the issue of such Ordinary Shares has been approved by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer (or by the management of Issuer if the Board of Directors have authorised the management to issue Ordinary Shares in connection with the exercise of Conversion Rights in respect of the Notes), (ii) the statutory auditor of the Issuer has confirmed that the Ordinary Shares to be issued are fully paid up, (iii) the applicable share capital increase has been registered by the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises and (iv) the Ordinary Shares have been entered with the VPS.
