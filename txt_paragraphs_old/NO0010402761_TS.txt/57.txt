(a) Interest Rate

payment of interest will be made on 3 June 2008 in respect of the period from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) 3 June 2008.
Where interest is required to be calculated for any period which is not an Interest Period, it will be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year consisting of 12 months of 30 days each, and in the case of an incomplete month, the number of days elapsed.
"Interest Period" means the payment period beginning on (and including) the Closing Date and ending on (but excluding) the first Interest Payment Date and each successive period beginning on (and including) an Interest Payment Date and ending on (but excluding) the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.
(b) Accrual of Interest
Each Note will cease to bear interest (i) where the Conversion Right shall have been exercised by a Noteholder, from the Interest Payment Date immediately preceding the relevant Conversion Date or, if none, the Closing Date (subject in any such case as provided in Condition 6(j)) or (ii) where such Note is being redeemed or repaid pursuant to Condition 7 or Condition 10, from the due date for redemption or repayment thereof unless payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused, in which event interest will continue to accrue at the Interest Rate (both before and after judgment) until whichever is the earlier of (a) the day on which all sums due in respect of such Note up to that day are received by or on behalf of the relevant holder, and (b) the day seven days after the Trustee or the Paying and Conversion Agent has notified Noteholders of receipt of all sums due in respect of all the Notes up to that seventh day (except to the extent that there is failure in the subsequent payment to the relevant holders under these Conditions).
