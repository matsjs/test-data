(c) Redemption for Taxation Reasons
At any time the Issuer may, having given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice (a "Tax Redemption Notice") to the Noteholders (which notice shall be irrevocable) redeem (subject to the second following paragraph) all, and not some only, of the Notes at their principal amount ("Tax Redemption Date"), together with accrued but unpaid interest to such date, if (i) the Issuer satisfies the Trustee immediately prior to the giving of such notice that the Issuer has or will become obliged to pay additional amounts in respect of principal or interest pursuant to Condition 9 as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of the Kingdom of Norway or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, or any change in the general application or official interpretation of such laws or regulations, which change or amendment becomes effective on or after the Closing Date, and (ii) such obligation cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it, provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer would be obliged to pay such additional amounts were a payment in respect of the Notes then due. Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to this paragraph, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee (a) a certificate signed by two Directors or duly appointed attorneys of the Issuer stating that the obligation referred to in (i) above cannot be avoided by the Issuer (taking reasonable measures available to it) and (b) an opinion of independent legal or tax advisers of recognised international standing to the effect that such change or amendment has occurred and that the Issuer is or will be obliged to pay such additional amounts as a result thereof (irrespective of whether such amendment or change is then effective) and the Trustee shall accept such certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the matters set out in (i) and (ii) above in which event it shall be conclusive and binding on the Noteholders.
Upon the expiry of a Tax Redemption Notice, the Issuer shall (subject to the next following paragraph) redeem the Notes at their principal amount, together with accrued interest to such date.
If the Issuer gives a notice of redemption pursuant to this Condition 7(c), each Noteholder will have the right to elect that his Note(s) shall not be redeemed and that the provisions of Condition 9 shall not apply in respect of any payment of interest to be made on such Note(s) which falls due after the relevant Tax Redemption Date whereupon no additional amounts shall be payable in respect thereof pursuant to Condition 9 and payment of all amounts shall be made subject to the deduction or withholding of the taxation required to be withheld or deducted by the Kingdom of Norway or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax. To exercise such right, the holder of the relevant Note must complete, sign and deposit at the specified office of any Paying and Conversion Agent a duly completed and signed notice of election, in the form for

the time being current, obtainable from the specified office of the Paying and Conversion Agent on or before the day falling 10 days prior to the Tax Redemption Date.
