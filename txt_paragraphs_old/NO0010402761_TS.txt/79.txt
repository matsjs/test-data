The Issuer may exercise such rights as it may from time to time enjoy to purchase or redeem or buy back its own shares (including Ordinary Shares) or any depositary or other receipts representing the same without the consent of the Noteholders.
The Trustee shall not be under any duty to monitor whether any event or circumstance has happened or exists which may require an adjustment to be made to the Conversion Price and will not be responsible to the Noteholders or any other person for any loss arising from any failure by it to do so.
(m) Consolidation, Amalgamation or Merger
Without prejudice to Condition 6(b)(x), in the case of any consolidation, amalgamation or merger of the Issuer with any other corporation (other than a consolidation, amalgamation or merger in which the Issuer is the continuing
52
corporation), or in the case of any sale or transfer of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Issuer, the Issuer will forthwith notify the Trustee and the Noteholders of such event and take such steps as shall be required by the Trustee (including the execution of a deed supplemental to or amending the Trust Deed) to ensure that each Note then outstanding will (during the period in which Conversion Rights may be exercised) be converted into the class and amount of shares and other securities and property receivable upon such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of Ordinary Shares which would have become liable to be issued upon exercise of Conversion Rights immediately prior to such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer. Such supplemental deed supplement or amendment will provide for adjustments which will be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Condition 6. The above provisions of this Condition 6(m) will apply, mutatis mutandis to any subsequent consolidations, amalgamations, mergers, sales or transfers.
7 Redemption, Purchase and Cancellation
(a) Final Redemption
Unless previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted as herein provided, the Notes will be redeemed at their principal amount on the Final Maturity Date. The Notes may only be redeemed at the option of the Issuer prior to the Final Maturity Date in accordance with Condition 7(b) or 7(c).
