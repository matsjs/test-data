The Group's future revenues may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year as a result of various factors including the following:
 fluctuating oil and natural gas prices, which may impact customer demand for the Group's services;
 different levels of activity planned by the customers;
 the timing of offshore lease sales and licensing rounds and the effect of such timing on the demand for seismic data and geophysical services;
 the timing of award and commencement of significant contracts for geophysical data acquisition services;
 weather and other seasonal factors;
 seasonality and other variations in the licensing of geophysical data from the Group's multi-client data library; and
 reduced vessel utilisation due to longer than scheduled yardstays, steaming for two Ramform vessels and delays in obtaining necessary permits.
For instance, on 19 December 2007, the Company announced that compared to the guidance given in the Company's interim financial report for the third quarter 2007, the expected fourth quarter 2007 productive time and related revenues and margins in the marine contract segment have been reduced. This was primarily due to longer than scheduled yardstays and steaming for two Ramform vessels and a delay in obtaining operational permits for one Ramform vessel. Please see Section 8.6 - "Recent developments" - for further information on the announcement.
