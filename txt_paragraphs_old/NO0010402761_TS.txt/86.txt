9 Taxation
All payments made by on or behalf the Issuer in respect of the Notes will be made free from any restriction or condition and be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Kingdom of Norway or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, unless deduction or withholding of such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges is compelled by law.
In the event that any such withholding or deduction is required to be made, the Issuer will pay such additional amounts as will result in the receipt by the Noteholders of the amounts which would otherwise have been receivable had no such withholding or deduction been required, except that no such additional amount shall be payable in respect of interest on any Note:
(a) to a holder (or to a third party on behalf of a holder) who is subject to such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges in respect of such Note by reason of his having some connection with the Kingdom of Norway other than merely by holding the Note or by receipt of amounts in respect of the Note or where the withholding or deduction could be avoided by the holder making a declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for exemption to the appropriate authority which such holder is legally capable and competent of making but fails to do so; or
(b) where such withholding or deduction is imposed on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26-27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive.
References in these Conditions to principal and interest shall be deemed also to refer to any additional amounts which may be payable under this Condition or any undertaking or covenant given in addition thereto or in substitution therefor pursuant to the Trust Deed.
