12 TAXATION
12.1 Norwegian taxation related to Notes
12.1.1 Introduction
The following is a summary of certain Norwegian tax considerations relevant to the acquisition of Notes, ownership and disposal of Notes and conversion of such Notes into shares in the Company by holders that are residents of Norway for purposes of Norwegian taxation.
Investors who are not residents of Norway for tax purposes are as a main rule not subject to Norwegian income tax or Norwegian net wealth tax in connection with acquisition, holding or disposal of Notes, unless their investment is linked to a Norwegian permanent establishment or any business conducted in Norway. Residents of other jurisdictions than Norway should consult with and rely upon local tax advisors as regards tax position in their country of residence.
The summary is based on applicable Norwegian laws, rules and regulations as they exist as of the date of this Prospectus. Such laws, rules and regulations are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to the holders and does not address foreign tax laws. Each holder should consult his or her own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences for him or her and the applicability and effect of any Norwegian or foreign tax laws and possible changes in such laws.
