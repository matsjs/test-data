8.6 Recent developments
On 19 December 2007, the Company announced in a press release that compared to the guidance given in the Company's interim financial report for the third quarter 2007, the expected fourth quarter 2007 productive time and related revenues and margins in the marine contract segment have been reduced. This is primarily due to longer than scheduled yardstays and steaming for two Ramform vessels and a delay in obtaining operational permits for one Ramform vessel.
