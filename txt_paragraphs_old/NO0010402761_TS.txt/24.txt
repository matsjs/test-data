 restrictions on currency repatriation or the imposition of new laws or regulations that preclude or restrict the conversion and free flow of currencies;
 the imposition of new laws or regulations that have the effect of restricting operations or increasing the cost of operations; and

2.1.4 Government regulation and political risks
The Group's operations are subject to numerous international conventions as well as national, state and local laws, and regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which the Group conducts, or will conduct, its business. These laws and regulations relate to the protection of the environment, natural resources, human health and safety, taxes, certification, licensing and other requirements. In particular, compliance with environmental regulations may require significant expenditures and breaches may result in fines and penalties, which may be material. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringently enforced and expensive to comply with and this trend is likely to continue. Whilst the Company has also paid particular attention to safety and environment in their planning of the business, stricter regulation or changes in the application of existing regulations may impose increased costs on operating the business of the Group, or otherwise impact the Group's financial condition, operating results or future prospects. The Company cannot predict the extent to which its future cash flow and earnings may be affected by mandatory compliance with any such new legislation or regulations.
