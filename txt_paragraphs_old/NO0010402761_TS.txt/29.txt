2.2.1 Borrowing and leverage
 the Group may need to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to debt service, which will reduce the amount of cash flow it will have available for capital investment, working capital and other general corporate purposes;
 the Group will be vulnerable to adverse developments in general economic and industry conditions;
 the Group may have constraints in responding to changing market conditions or in pursuing favourable business opportunities;
 the Group may be limited in its ability to borrow additional funds; and
 the Group may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to competitors that have less debt and/or less onerous contractual obligations.
In addition to existing debt obligations, from time to time the Group may enter into transactions to acquire assets or shares of other companies, or to contract new-buildings. These transactions along with the Group's ongoing operations may be financed partially or wholly with debt, which may increase the Group's debt levels. Depending on future investment plans, the Group may require additional financing, which may not be available or, if available, may not be available on favourable terms. Failure to obtain such financing on a timely basis could cause the Group to forfeit or forego various opportunities. Failure to obtain financing on attractive terms may result in increased financing costs and could adversely affect the Group's earnings and financial position.
2.2.2 Exchange rate fluctuations
Currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency devaluations could have a material impact on the Group's results of operations from time to time. Historically, most of the Group's revenue and operating expenses have been generated in U.S.$, NOK and British pounds, but the Group predominantly sells its products and services in U.S.$ while a higher portion of the operating expenses are incurred in NOK and British pounds. A depreciation in the U.S.$ compared to these other currencies would adversely affect the Group's reported results of operations because expenses denominated in NOK or British pounds would be converted into U.S.$, the Company's reporting currency, at an increased value.
