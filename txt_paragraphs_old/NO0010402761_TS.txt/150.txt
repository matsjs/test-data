The value of Notes at the end of each income year will be included in the computation of the Noteholder's taxable net wealth for municipal and state net wealth tax purposes. Listed notes are valued at their quoted value on 1 January in the year of assessment. The current marginal wealth tax rate is 1.1 per cent. Resident limited liability companies and certain similar entities are exempt from Norwegian net wealth taxation.
12.1.6 Inheritance Tax
The transfer of Notes by inheritance or gift may give raise to a liability to pay inheritance or gift tax to Norway if the deceased, at the time of death, or the donor, at the time of the gift, is a resident or citizen of Norway. However, in the case of inheritance tax, if the deceased was a citizen but not a resident of Norway, Norwegian inheritance tax will not be levied if inheritance tax or a similar tax is levied in the country where the deceased was resident. Irrespective of residence or citizenship, Norwegian inheritance tax may be levied if the Notes are held in connection with the conduct of a trade or business in Norway.
