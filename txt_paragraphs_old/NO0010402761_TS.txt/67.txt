B is the number of Ordinary Shares which the aggregate consideration (if any) receivable for the Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon conversion or exchange or upon exercise of the right of subscription attached to such Securities or, as the case may be, for the Ordinary Shares to be issued or to arise from any such redesignation would purchase at such Current Market Price per Ordinary Share; and
