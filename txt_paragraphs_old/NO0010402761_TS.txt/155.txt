Non-resident shareholders
Gains from sale or other disposal of shares by a non-resident shareholder will not be subject to taxation in Norway unless the non-resident shareholder is an individual and (i) holds the shares effectively connected with business activities carried on in or managed from Norway, or (ii) has been a resident of Norway for tax purposes within the five calendar years preceding the sale or disposal, and the gains are not exempt pursuant to the provisions of a tax treaty. If the latter rule applies, the latent gain on the shares at the time the individual ceased to be a resident in Norway for tax purposes will be taxable in Norway.
12.2.4 N e t W ealth Tax
Resident corporate shareholders and certain similar entities are exempt from Norwegian net wealth tax. For other resident shareholders, shares will form part of their basis for calculation of Norwegian net wealth tax. The current marginal net wealth tax rate is 1.1 per cent.
Listed shares are valued at 85 per cent. of their quoted value as of 1 January in the assessment year. The Norwegian Ministry of Finance has however in Ot. prp. no. 1 (2007-2008) proposed that listed shares shall be valued at 100 per cent. of their quoted value as of 1 January in the assessment year, with effect from the fiscal year 2008.
A non-resident shareholder is not subject to Norwegian net wealth tax with respect to the shares, unless his shareholding is effectively connected with a business carried out by the shareholder in Norway.
