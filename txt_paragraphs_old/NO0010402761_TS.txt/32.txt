2.3.3
The Company is organised under the laws of Norway. Some of the Company's directors and officers reside outside of the United States, and the substantial parts of the Group's assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors in the United States to effect service of process within the United States upon the Company or the Company's directors and officers that reside outside of the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated on the civil liability provisions of U.S. Federal securities laws against the Company or the Company's directors and officers. In addition, punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may be unenforceable in Norway.
