· reduced vessel utilisation due to longer than scheduled yardstays, steaming for two Ramform vessels and delays in obtaining necessary permits.
2.1.6 Service life and technical risks
The service life of a modern seismic vessel is generally considered to exceed twenty-five years, but may ultimately depend on its efficiency, vessel maintenance and demand for such equipment. There can be no guarantee that the vessels owned or operated by the Group will have a long service life. The vessels may experience particular unforeseen technical problems or deficiencies, new environmental requirements may be enforced, or new technical solutions or vessels may be introduced that are more efficient than the vessels owned or operated by the Group, causing less demand and use of these vessels.

2.1.7 Competition
The markets in which the Group operates are highly competitive. The Group may face competition from certain companies within the seismic industry as well as other ship owners. Furthermore, overcapacity in the seismic market would have a negative effect on the operating results of the Group.
2.1.8 Construction risks
Arrow, a newly acquired subsidiary of PGS, currently has four new building projects and two conversion projects. In addition, the Group has one new building project independent of Arrow. As a result, the Group is exposed to the risk of failure, cost overruns, delayed delivery, and technically unsound solutions associated with the new building and conversion projects. There can be no assurances that delays and cost overruns will not occur and such events, if occurring, could have an adverse impact on the financial position of the Group.
