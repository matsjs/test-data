The Conversion Right may be exercised by a Noteholder during the Conversion Period by delivering a duly completed and signed notice of conversion (a "Conversion Notice") in the form (for the time being current) obtainable from the Paying and Conversion Agent to the specified office of the Paying and Conversion Agent, during its usual business hours. Conversion Rights shall be exercised subject in each case to any applicable fiscal or other laws or regulations applicable in the jurisdiction in which the specified office of the Paying and Conversion Agent is
located. If such delivery is made after the end of normal business hours or on a day which is not a business day in the place of the specified office of the Paying and Conversion Agent, such delivery shall be deemed for all purposes of these Conditions to have been made on the next following such business day.
A Conversion Notice, once delivered, shall be irrevocable.
The conversion date in respect of a Note (the "Conversion Date") shall be the Oslo business day immediately following the date of the delivery of the Notes and the Conversion Notice and, if applicable, the making of any payment to be made as provided below.
A Noteholder exercising a Conversion Right must pay directly to the relevant authorities any taxes and capital, stamp, issue and registration duties arising on conversion (other than any taxes or capital duties or stamp duties payable in the Kingdom of Norway in respect of the allotment and issue of any Ordinary Shares on such conversion (including any Additional Ordinary Shares), which shall be paid by the Issuer) and such Noteholder must pay all, if any, taxes arising by reference to any disposal or deemed disposal of a Note or interest therein in connection with such conversion. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall not be responsible for determining whether such taxes or capital, stamp, issue or registration duties are payable or the amount of such taxes or capital, stamp, issue or registration duties and it shall not be responsible or liable for any failure by the Issuer to pay such taxes or capital, stamp, issue or registration duties.
Ordinary Shares to be issued or delivered on exercise of Conversion Rights will be issued or delivered in electronic form through the facilities of the VPS to such VPS Account as specified by the Noteholder in the relevant Conversion Notice.
The Issuer will take all necessary steps to procure that the Ordinary Shares to be issued or delivered on exercise of Conversion Rights are issued and/or delivered by no later than the Delivery Date (as defined below) and will promptly make all necessary filings with, and applications to, the Relevant Stock Exchange for the admission to listing and to trading of such Ordinary Shares.
