Such adjustment shall become effective on the date on which the relevant Dividend is paid or made or, in the case of a purchase of Ordinary Shares or any receipts or certificates representing Ordinary Shares, on the date such purchase is made or, in any such case if later, the first date upon which the Fair Market Value of the relevant Dividend is capable of being determined as provided herein.
For the purposes of the above, the Fair Market Value of a Cash Dividend shall (subject as provided in paragraph (a) of the definition of "Dividend" and in the definition of "Fair Market Value") be determined as at the date of the first public announcement of the relevant Dividend, and in the case of a Non-Cash Dividend, the Fair Market Value of the relevant Dividend shall be the Fair Market Value of the relevant Spin-Off Securities or, as the case may be, the relevant property or assets.
