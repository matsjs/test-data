On any adjustment, the resultant Conversion Price, if not an integral multiple of NOK 0.01, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of NOK 0.01. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price where such adjustment (rounded down if applicable) would be less than one per cent. of the Conversion Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any amount by which the Conversion Price has been rounded down, shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and such subsequent adjustment shall be made on the basis that the adjustment not required to be made had been made at the relevant time.
Notice of any adjustments to the Conversion Price shall be given by the Issuer to Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 and the Trustee promptly after the determination thereof.
The Conversion Price shall not in any event be reduced to below the nominal value of the Ordinary Shares and the Issuer undertakes that it shall not take any action, and shall procure that no action is taken, that would otherwise result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price to below such nominal value.
