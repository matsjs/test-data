Under the share buy back program, PGS can repurchase its shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market where the shares are traded. The purpose of the share repurchase program is to allow the Company to optimise its capital structure. Repurchased shares may be reissued under the Company's employee stock option or other incentive plans, as consideration payable for acquisitions made by PGS, or as consideration for any merger, demerger or acquisition in which PGS participates. In addition, PGS may elect to cancel shares repurchased.
