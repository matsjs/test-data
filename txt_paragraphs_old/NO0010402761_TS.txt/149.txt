Investors who are not residents of Norway for tax purposes are as a main rule not subject to Norwegian income tax or Norwegian net wealth tax in connection with acquisition, holding or disposal of Notes, unless their investment is linked to a Norwegian permanent establishment or any business conducted in Norway. Residents of other jurisdictions than Norway should consult with and rely upon local tax advisors as regards tax position in their country of residence.

12.1.2 T axation o f interest
Interest on Notes is taxable income for both individual Noteholders and corporate Noteholders at a flat rate of 28 per cent. Interest on Notes is taxed on accrual basis, i.e. regardless of when the return is actually paid.
12.1.3 Taxation upon disposal, redem ption o r conversion o f N otes
The Ministry of Finance has in a statement dated 6 December 2005 assumed that convertible notes are not comprised by the tax exemption method for corporate shareholders. The description below presumes that this statement is correct.
Redemption at the end of term as well as prior disposal is treated as realisation of Notes and will trigger a capital gain or loss. A conversion of Notes into shares will constitute a taxable event and be treated as if the Notes had been sold in exchange of shares. Capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income at a flat rate of 28 per cent. Losses will be deductible in the Noteholder's ordinary income. Any capital gain or loss is computed as the difference between the amount received by the Noteholder on realisation (the market value of the shares received in case of conversion) and the cost price of the Note. The cost price is equal to the price for which the Noteholder acquired the Notes.
Costs incurred in connection with the purchase and realisation of Notes may be deducted from the Noteholder's taxable ordinary income in the year of realisation of the Notes.
