In 2005 the Board of Directors established a performance bonus incentive plan for the President and CEO, as well as for other executive officers. This plan was amended in 2006. Under the amended plan, the mentioned executives who were employed by the Company during 2006 and remained employed as of December 2006 were entitled to a maximum cash bonus of up to 50 per cent. (or in the case of the CEO 60 per cent.) of annual base salary and a maximum share purchase bonus of up to 25 per cent. (or in the case of the CEO 30 per cent.) of annual base salary. Within these limits, bonuses were determined on the basis of achievement of financial and nonfinancial performance targets. Any amounts received as a share purchase bonus, on a net basis (after withholding tax), were required to be used to buy PGS shares at market prices and held for a minimum of three years.
