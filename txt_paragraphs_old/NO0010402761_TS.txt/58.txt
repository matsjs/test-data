6 Conversion of Notes
Subject as provided below, each Note shall entitle the holder (a "Conversion Right") to convert ("Conversion") such Note into new and/or existing Ordinary Shares, credited as fully paid, subject to and as provided in these Conditions.
The number of Ordinary Shares to be issued or delivered on exercise of a Conversion Right shall be determined by dividing the principal amount of the relevant Note to be converted (translated into NOK at the fixed rate of NOK 5.5188 = U.S.$1.00) by the conversion price (the "Conversion Price") in effect on the relevant Conversion Date.
The initial Conversion Price is NOK 216.19 per Ordinary Share. The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment in the circumstances described in Condition 6(b).
A Noteholder may exercise the Conversion Right in respect of a Note by delivering a Conversion Notice (as defined in Condition 6(h)) to the specified office of the
36
Paying and Conversion Agent in accordance with Condition 6(h) whereupon the Issuer shall (subject as provided in these Conditions) procure the delivery, to or as directed by the relevant Noteholder of Ordinary Shares credited as paid up in full as provided in this Condition 6.
Subject to, and as provided in these Conditions, the Conversion Right in respect of a Note may be exercised, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time (subject to any applicable fiscal or other laws or regulations and as hereinafter provided) from 30 January 2008 to the close of business (in the place where the specified office of the Paying and Conversion Agent is located) on the date falling six days prior to the Final Maturity Date (both days inclusive) or, if the Notes shall have been called for redemption pursuant to Condition 7(b) or 7(c) prior to the Final Maturity Date, then up to the close of business (at the place aforesaid) on the sixth day before the date fixed for redemption thereof pursuant to Condition 7(b) or 7(c), unless there shall be default in making payment in respect of such Note on such date fixed for redemption, in which event the Conversion Right shall extend up to the close of business (at the place aforesaid) on the date on which the full amount of such payment becomes available for payment and notice of such availability has been duly given in accordance with Condition 16 or, if earlier, the Final Maturity Date; provided that, in each case, if the final such date for the exercise of Conversion Rights is not a business day at the place aforesaid, then the period for exercise of the Conversion Right by Noteholders shall end on the immediately preceding business day at the place aforesaid.
Conversion Rights may not be exercised (i) following the giving of notice by the Trustee pursuant to Condition 10 or (ii) in respect of a Note which the relevant holder has exercised its right to require the Issuer to redeem pursuant to Condition 7(e).
