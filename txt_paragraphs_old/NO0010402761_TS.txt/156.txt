A non-resident shareholder is not subject to Norwegian net wealth tax with respect to the shares, unless his shareholding is effectively connected with a business carried out by the shareholder in Norway.
When shares are transferred either through inheritance or as a gift, such transfer may give rise to inheritance or gift tax in Norway if the deceased, at the time of death, or the donor, at the time of the gift, is a resident or citizen of Norway. However, in the case of inheritance tax, if the deceased was a citizen but not a resident of Norway, Norwegian inheritance tax will not be levied if inheritance tax, or a similar tax, is levied by the deceased's country of residence. Irrespective of residence or citizenship, Norwegian inheritance tax may be levied if the shares are effectively connected with certain business activities carried out by the shareholder in Norway.
12.2.6 Transfer Taxes
There is currently no Norwegian stamp duty or other transfer taxes, including VAT, on the transfer or issuance of shares.
