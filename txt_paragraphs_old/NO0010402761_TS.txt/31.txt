As a multinational organisation, the Group is subject to taxation in many jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws. The amounts of taxes the Group pays in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in these laws or their interpretations by the relevant taxing authorities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's liquidity and results of operations. In addition, those authorities could review tax returns and impose additional taxes and penalties, which could be material. The Company has identified issues in several jurisdictions that could eventually make the Group liable to pay material amounts in taxes relating to prior years. Additional issues that the Company is not currently aware of may be identified in the future.

2.3.2 Market risk
The price of the Notes will depend on circumstances related to the Company and the Group, and in the oil and offshore industry in general. The price will also depend on general fluctuation in the industrial bond market.
