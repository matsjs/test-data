extension of the reservoir's useful life. The Group provides this service as well as the acquisition of more conventional two dimensional (2D) seismic data.
The Group manages its business in two segments as follows:
· Marine, which consists of streamer seismic data acquisition and marine multi-client library. The marine segment has a global scope, and includes the Group's data processing, technology development, research and development and reservoir-related consulting activities; and
· Onshore, which consists of all seismic operations on land and in very shallow water and transition zones, and including our onshore multi-client library. The onshore segment is regional in scope, namely focusing on North America, South America and Africa.
In the Group's financials, data processing and technology is reported as part of the marine segment. The marine segment (including data processing and technology) accounts for approximately 80 per cent. of the Group's total turnover, and is managed from Lysaker, Norway. The onshore segment accounts for approximately 20 per cent. of the Group's total turnover and is managed from Houston, Texas.
8.2 Contract and Multi-Client Operations
8.2.1 Contract Operations
When the Group acquires seismic data on a contract basis, the customers direct the scope and extent of the survey and retain ownership of the data obtained. Contracts for seismic data acquisition, which are generally awarded on a competitive bid basis, may include both a dayrate and a production rate element.
Under these contracts, the customer assumes primary responsibility for interruption of acquisition operations due to factors that are beyond the Group's control, including weather and permitting. Contracts are also awarded on a turnkey basis. With turnkey contracts, the customers pay based upon the number of seismic lines or square kilometres of seismic data collected.
