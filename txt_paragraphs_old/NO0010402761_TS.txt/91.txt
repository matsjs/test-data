(ii) any modification of such rights which is not, in the opinion of an Independent Financial Adviser (acting as an expert) selected by the Issuer, approved in writing by the Trustee, materially prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the Notes; or
(iii) any issue of equity share capital where the issue of such equity share capital results, or would, but for the provisions of Condition 6(f) relating to the carry forward of adjustments or the fact that the consideration per Ordinary Share receivable therefore is at least 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share, otherwise result, in an adjustment to the Conversion Price; or
(iv) any issue of equity share capital or modification of rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares, where prior thereto the Issuer shall have instructed an Independent Financial Adviser to determine what (if any) adjustments should be made to the Conversion Price as being fair and reasonable to take account thereof and such Independent Financial Adviser shall have determined in good faith either that no adjustment is required or that an adjustment resulting in an increase in the Conversion Price is required and, if so, the new Conversion Price as a result thereof and the basis upon which such adjustment is to be made and, in any such case, the date on which the adjustment shall take effect (and so that the adjustment shall be made and shall take effect accordingly);
