After the acquisition of Arrow, the sale of Ramform Victory and the delivery of the newbuild Ramform Sovereign, the Group currently owns 15 marine streamer vessels, including 6 vessels of the unique Ramform class, which are all in operations. In addition, PGS has ordered one Ramform new-build vessel scheduled for delivery in Q2 2009, respectively. In 2007 the Group reached an agreement with the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry ("METI") for a long term cooperation agreement, which includes the sale and flag change of the 3D seismic vessel Ramform Victory and the continued provision by PGS of intellectual property and technical and operational services. The vessel was delivered in Q1 2008 (please see a more detailed description under Section 8.5). Further, Arrow has ordered four high capacity seismic new build vessels for delivery in 2008 and 2009 (of which two are contracted). Arrow has also purchased two vessels planned for conversion.
The fleet contains the following vessels:
