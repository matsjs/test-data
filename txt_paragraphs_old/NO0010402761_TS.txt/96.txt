The Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders, agree with the Issuer (01) to the substitution in place of the Issuer (or any previous substitute or substitutes under this Condition) as the principal debtor under the Notes and the Trust Deed of any Subsidiary of the Issuer subject to (a) the Notes being unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Issuer, and (b) the Notes continuing to be convertible or exchangeable into Ordinary Shares as provided in these Conditions mutatis mutandis as provided in these Conditions, with such amendments as the Trustee shall consider appropriate or (02) to the substitution of Newco as provided in Condition 11(i) provided that in any such case, (x) the Trustee is satisfied that the interests of the Noteholders will not be materially prejudiced by the substitution, and (y) certain other conditions set out in the Trust Deed have been complied with. In the case of such a substitution the Trustee may agree, without the consent of the Noteholders, to a change of the law governing the Notes and/or the Trust Deed provided that such change would not in the opinion of the Trustee be materially
prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders. Any such substitution shall be binding on the Noteholders and shall be notified promptly to the Noteholders.
(d) E n titlem en t o f the Trustee
In connection with the exercise of its functions (including but not limited to those referred to in this Condition) the Trustee shall have regard to the interests of the Noteholders as a class and, in particular but without limitation, shall not have regard to the consequences of the exercise of its trusts, powers or discretions for individual Noteholders resulting from their being for any purpose domiciled or resident in, or otherwise connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any particular territory, and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Noteholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer or any other person any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual Noteholders.

The Trustee may at any time, at its discretion and without notice, take such proceedings against the Issuer as it may think fit to enforce the provisions of the Trust Deed and the Notes, but it shall not be bound to take any such proceedings or any other action in relation to the Trust Deed or the Notes unless (i) it shall have been so directed by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders or so requested in writing by the holders of at least one-quarter in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, and (ii) it shall have been indemnified and/or secured as to costs to its satisfaction. No Noteholder shall be entitled to proceed directly against the Issuer or unless the Trustee, having become bound so to proceed, fails so to do within a reasonable period and the failure shall be continuing.

The Trustee may rely without liability to Noteholders on a report, confirmation or certificate or any advice of any accountants, financial advisers or investment bank, whether or not addressed to it and whether their liability in relation thereto is limited (by its terms or by any engagement letter relating thereto entered into by the Trustee or in any other manner) by reference to a monetary cap, methodology or otherwise. The Trustee shall be obliged to accept and be entitled to rely on any such report, confirmation or certificate or advice where the Issuer procures delivery of the same pursuant to its obligation to do so under a condition hereof or any provision of the
