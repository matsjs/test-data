(1) The Group has UK lease arrangements for each of the Ramform Valiant and the Ramform Challenger. Under the leases, the Group leases the vessels under long-term charters that give the Group the option to purchase the vessels for a de minimis amount at the end of the charter periods. The leases are legally defeased because the Group has made payments to banks in consideration for which the banks have assumed liability to the lessors equal to basic rentals and termination sum obligations.
