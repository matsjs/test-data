14.1 Legal disputes
The Group operates internationally facing complex environments and jurisdictions and is involved in several legal disputes connected to its operations around the world and/or its employment base including former employees. However, during the last 12 months no new legal disputes (including legal proceedings, actual or threatened) have been identified, which may have or have had in the recent past, significant effects on the Company's or the Group's financial position or profitability.
In the Company's annual report for 2006 the Company has disclosed certain contingencies in the tax area, which could potentially be significant, as follows:
Singapore - Tax Deduction for Multi-Client Amortization
The Company previously received a tax claim from the tax authority in Singapore, which was based on the assertion that tax deductions for expenses related to investments in the multi client data library would not be allowed. The Company filed tax returns claiming tax deductions for amortization of the multi-client library. Based on the facts and the uncertainty associated with the application of the tax law, the Company determined that it was probable that the deduction would be disallowed. Accordingly, additional tax liability was accrued based on a total disallowance of the deduction. In late February 2007, the tax authorities in Singapore decided to allow such deductions. This is considered to be a non-adjusting event occurring after the balance sheet date, which will lead to a reversal in the first quarter of 2007.

The actual effect to the tax expense in the first quarter of 2007 will be a benefit of U.S.$ 8.5 million.
