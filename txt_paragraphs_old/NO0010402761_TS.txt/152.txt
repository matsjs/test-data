12.2.2 T axation o f D ividends
Dividends distributed from the Company to resident corporate shareholders (i.e. limited liability companies and similar entities) are currently exempt from taxation.
Resident Individual Shareholders
Dividends distributed from the Company to individual shareholders exceeding a calculated tax free allowance, will be taxed as ordinary income for the shareholder at a flat rate of 28 per cent. The tax-free allowance is calculated as the acquisition cost of the share multiplied by a determined (risk-free) interest rate after tax. The tax-free allowance will be calculated on each individual share, not on a portfolio basis. Unused allowance may be carried forward and set off against future dividends or against gains upon realisation of the same share.
The tax free allowance is allocated to the individual shareholders holding shares at the end of each calendar year. Individual shareholders who transfer shares will not be entitled to deduct any calculated allowance related to the year of transfer.

Non-resident Shareholders
Dividends distributed to non-resident shareholders are in general subject to a Norwegian withholding tax of 25 per cent., unless otherwise provided for in an applicable tax treaty (or exemptions for EEA shareholders apply, see below). Norway has entered into tax treaties with more than 70 countries. In most tax treaties the withholding tax rate is reduced to 15 per cent.
Non-resident shareholders, who have been subject to a higher withholding tax than applicable in the relevant tax treaty, may apply to the Norwegian tax authorities for a refund of the excess taxes (withheld). The application is to be filed with the Central Office - Foreign Tax Affairs.
