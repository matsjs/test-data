Conditions Subsequent:
(b) the present value on the relevant record date of the remaining interest payments (excluding accrued but unpaid interest up to the relevant redemption date) up to and including the First Call Date (assuming that the Interest Rate for the period from the relevant record date to the First Call Date will be equal to the Interest Rate in effect on the date on which notice of redemption is given to the bondholders),
both present values under items (a) and (b) above calculated by using a discount rate of 50 basis points over the comparable Swedish Government Bond Rate (i.e. comparable to the remaining duration of the Bonds until the First Call Date) (together with accrued but unpaid interest on the redeemed amount up to the relevant redemption date) and where "relevant record date" shall mean a date agreed upon between the Agent, the CSD and the Issuer in connection with such payment.
The Issuer shall establish the Escrow Account prior to the First Issue Date. On the First Issue Date, the Issuing Agent shall transfer the Net Proceeds to the Escrow Account. For the purpose of securing that the Conditions Precedent for Disbursement have been fulfilled before any disbursement of the Net Proceeds is made, the Escrow Account will be pledged in favour of the Agent and the bondholders (represented by the Agent) in accordance with the Escrow Account Pledge Agreement. The pledge over the Escrow Account shall be released, in accordance with the Escrow Account Pledge Agreement, when the Conditions Precedent for Disbursement have been fulfilled.
