TRANSACTION SECURITY
As continuing Security for the due and punctual fulfilment of the Secured Obligations, the Issuer grants, and shall procure that the Guarantors grant, the Transaction Security to the Secured Parties as represented by the Trustee. The Transaction Security shall be provided and perfected pursuant to, and subject to the terms of, the Security Documents. The Trustee shall hold the Transaction Security on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the Security Documents.
The Trustee shall, on behalf of the Secured Parties, keep all certificates and other documents that are bearers of rights relating to the Transaction Security in safe custody.
Unless and until the Trustee has received instructions from the Bondholders in accordance with Clause 19 (Decisions by Bondholders), the Trustee shall (without first having to obtain the Bondholders' consent) be entitled to enter into agreements with the Issuer or a third party or take any other actions, if it is, in the Trustee's opinion, necessary for the purpose of maintaining, altering, releasing or enforcing the Transaction Security, creating further Security for the benefit of the Secured Parties or for the purpose of settling the Bondholders' or the Issuer's rights to the Transaction Security, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents.
