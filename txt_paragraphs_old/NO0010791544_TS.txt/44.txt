Payment constituting good discharge of the Issuer's payment obligations to the Bondholders under these Terms and Conditions will be deemed to have been made to each Bondholder once the amount has been credited to the bank holding the bank account nominated by the Bondholder in connection with its Securities Account in the CSD. If the paying bank and the receiving bank are the same, payment shall be deemed to have been made once the amount has been credited to the bank account nominated by the Bondholder in question.
All amounts payable under the Finance Documents shall be payable in the relevant denomination of the Bonds as set out in Clause 2.1 above. If, however, the denomination differs from the currency of the bank account connected to the Bondholder's Securities Account in the CSD, any cash settlement may be exchanged and credited to this bank account in accordance with the procedures of the CSD.
Any specific payment instructions, including foreign exchange bank account details, to be connected to the Bondholder's account in the CSD must be provided by the relevant Bondholder to the Paying Agent (either directly or through its Account Operator in the CSD) within five Business Days prior to a payment date. Depending on any currency exchange settlement agreements between each Bondholder's bank and the Paying Agent, and opening hours of the receiving bank, cash settlement may be delayed, and payment shall be deemed to have been made once the cash settlement has taken place, provided, however, that no default interest or other penalty shall accrue for the account of the Issuer for such delay.
If an Interest Payment Date or other relevant date for payments to the Bondholders pursuant to the Finance Documents falls on a day on which either of the relevant CSD settlement system or the relevant currency settlement system for the Bonds are not open, the payment shall be made on the first following possible day on which both of the said systems are open, unless any provision to the contrary have been set out for such payment in the relevant Finance Document.
If, due to any obstacle for the CSD, the Issuer cannot make a payment or repayment, such payment or repayment may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed. Interest shall accrue in accordance with Clause 11.4 during such postponement.
If payment or repayment is made in accordance with this Clause 10.1 (Payment obligations and currency), the Issuer shall be deemed to have fulfilled its obligation to pay, irrespective of whether such payment was made to a person not entitled to receive such amount.
