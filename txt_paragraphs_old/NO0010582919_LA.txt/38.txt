The Bonds, including accrued but unpaid interest and expenses, shall be secured by the Security Interests.
Save for the Performance Guarantee Account, no Security Interest may be assigned, mortgaged or pledged with equal or better priority to any other party during the term of the Loan, but may, in connection with the Contract and subject to an inter-creditor agreement in a form and content acceptable to the Bond Trustee, be encumbered on priority ranking after the Loan, to the National Oilco or a bank.
Interest
The Issuer shall pay interest on the face value of the Bonds from, and including, the Issue Date at the rate equivalent to LIBOR plus the Margin, or, the Reference Bank Rate plus the Margin (as applicable) (together the "Floating Rate").
Interest payments shall be made in arrears on the Interest Payment Dates each year, the first time on 21 October 2010.
The relevant interest payable amount shall be calculated based on a period from, and including, one Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next following applicable Interest Payment Date.
The Day Count Fraction in respect of the calculation of the payable interest amount shall be "Actual/360", which means that the actual number of days in the relevant calculation period divided by 360.
The applicable Floating Rate on the Bonds is set/reset on each Interest Payment Date by the Bond Trustee commencing on the Interest Payment Date at the beginning of the relevant calculation period.
