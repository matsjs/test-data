19.1 The Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally:
(b) undertakes with the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) that, whenever the Issuer does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document, the Guarantor shall, on the Bond Trustee's first written demand and in no event any later than five (5) Business Days after Guarantor's receipt of such demand, pay that amount to the Bond Trustee as if it were the principal obligor in respect of that amount; and
(c) agrees with the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) that if, for any reason, any amount claimed by the Bond Trustee under this clause is not recoverable from the Guarantor, then the Guarantor will be liable as a principal debtor and primary obligor to indemnify the Bond Trustee and each Bondholder for any loss each of them may incur as a result of the Issuer failing to pay any amount expressed to be payable by it under a Finance Document on the date when it ought to have been paid.
19.2 The Guarantor hereby waives:
(a) any requirement that the Bond Trustee or any of the Bondholders in case of an Event of Default first have to make demand upon or seek to enforce remedies against the Issuer;
(b) any right to exercise right of subrogation into the rights of the Bondholders under the Bond Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Bond Trustee until such time that no amounts are outstanding under this Bond Agreement and any other Finance Document; and
(c) any right to claim reimbursement from the Issuer for payment made hereunder until such time that no amounts are outstanding under this Bond Agreement and any other Finance Document.
19.3 This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of all sums payable by the Issuer under the Finance Documents, regardless of (i) any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part or (ii) the Bond Trustee enforcing any other security granted for the Issuer's obligations under this Bond Agreement.
