If, in order to make a valid decision, it is necessary, pursuant to Clause 18, to hold a new Bondholders' meeting and to discuss the matter again, such new Bondholders' meeting cannot be called before the first meeting has been held. The notice of the new meeting shall inform of the results of the vote at the first Bondholders' meeting.
The meeting shall be presided over by the Loan Trustee, unless the Bondholders' meeting decides otherwise. If the Loan Trustee is not present, the meeting shall be presided over by a Bondholder or representative of the Bondholders, elected by the Bondholders.
The minutes of the meeting shall be kept, showing the Bondholders present - personally or by proxy - as well as how many votes each Bondholder may cast. Further, the decisions made at the meeting, as well as the result of the vote, shall be recorded in the minutes. The minutes shall be signed by the chairman and two Bondholders or proxies. The minutes shall be kept in a safe manner by the Loan Trustee, and shall be available to the Bondholders.
17.5 Bondholders, the Borrower, the Loan Trustee and - if the Loan is listed - the Exchange have the right to attend the Bondholders' meeting. The Bondholders' meeting may grant entrance to the meeting to other parties. The participants at the meeting have the right to meet with an adviser and/or by proxy.
17.6 At the Bondholders' meeting each Bondholder has one vote for each Bond held. The notification of the number of Bonds in the Loan (print-out) sent to each Bondholder through the Securities Depository in the notice of the meeting, see Clause 17.3, serves as proof of ownership of the Bonds and of each Bondholder's right to vote. In the event that Bonds have been transferred after the print-out was made, the new Bondholder must bring to the meeting the original notice and the print-out, endorsed so as to document the transfer.
The Borrower's Bonds do not entitle to vote and are not taken into account when determining the number of voting Bonds.
In case of doubt, the Bondholders' meeting decides whether a Bondholders may vote and how many votes each Bondholder has.
