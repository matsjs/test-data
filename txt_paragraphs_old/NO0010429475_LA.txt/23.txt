Bondholders and the Exchange (if applicable) shall receive written notice from the Securities Depository that an appeal has been made against the procedure for fixing the interest rate in accordance with sub-clause 9.3.
9.5 At each Interest Payment Date, the Borrower shall pay interests as PIK rounded down to the nearest NOK 1. PIK shall be calculated based on the total number of Bonds held at each Interest Payment Date (including previous issued Bonds in connection with payment of interest as additional Bonds). The additional Bonds issued upon payment of interest give the same rights as the other issued Bonds as of the registration of the increased outstanding amount of Bonds in the Securities Depository.
The Borrower may, however, subject to prior written consent from the Facility Agent subject to the terms and conditions of the Subordination Agreement, make interest payments to the Bondholders in cash on an Interest Payment Date. Such cash payment shall be noticed to the Bondholders at least 10 Banking Days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date.
