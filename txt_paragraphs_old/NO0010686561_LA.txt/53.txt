Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring the Bond Trustee (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person before claiming from that Guarantor under this Clause 9. This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary.

Appropriations
Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, the Bond Trustee may:
(a) refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by the Bond Trustee (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and
(b) hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantor's liability under this Clause 9.
