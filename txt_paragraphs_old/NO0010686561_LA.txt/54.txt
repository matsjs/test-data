If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it shall hold that benefit, payment or distribution to the extent necessary to enable all amounts which may be or become payable to the Bond Trustee by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents to be repaid in full on behalf of the Bond Trustee and shall promptly pay or transfer the same to the Bond Trustee or as the Bond Trustee may direct.
