If the Holders, without any prior initiative to decision from the Agent or the Issuer, have made a decision regarding termination in accordance with Clause 15 {Decisions by Holders), the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. The Agent is however not liable to take action if the Agent considers cause for termination not to be at hand, unless the instructing Holders agree in writing to indemnify and hold the Agent harmless from any loss or liability and, if requested by the Agent in its discretion, grant sufficient security for such indemnity.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Bonds cannot be terminated and become due for payment prematurely according to this Clause 13 without relevant decision by the Agent or following instructions from the Holders' pursuant to Clause 15 {Decisions by Holders).
