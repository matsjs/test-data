12. 12.1
SPECIAL UNDERTAKINGS
So long as any Bond remains outstanding, the Issuer undertakes to comply with the special undertakings set forth in this Clause 12.
Distributions
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of its Subsidiaries, (i) pay any dividend on shares, (ii) repurchase any of its own shares, (iii) redeem its share capital or other restricted equity with repayment to shareholders, (iv) repay principal or pay interest under any shareholder loans or (v) make any other similar distribution or transfers of value (Sw. värdeöverföringar) (items (i)--(v) above are together and individually referred to as a "Restricted Payment"), provided however that any such Restricted Payment can be made, if such Restricted Payment is permitted by law and no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such Restricted Payment, by any Group Company if such Restricted Payment is made to another Group Company and, if made by any Subsidiary which is not directly or indirectly wholly-owned by the Parent, is made on a pro rata basis.
Listing of Bonds
The Issuer shall ensure (i) that the Bonds are listed at First North Bond Market within 180 calendar days after the Issue Date and (ii) that the Bonds, once admitted to trading on First North Bond Market, continue being listed thereon (however, taking into account the rules and regulations of First North Bond Market and the CSD (as amended from time to time) preventing trading in the Bonds in close connection to the redemption of the Bonds).
Financial Indebtedness
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that no other Group Company will, incur any new, or maintain or prolong any existing, Financial Indebtedness granted by a (direct or indirect) shareholder of the Issuer or any Affiliates thereof, unless such Financial Indebtedness is subordinated to the Bonds, only carries payment in kind interest and has a longer term than the Bonds.
