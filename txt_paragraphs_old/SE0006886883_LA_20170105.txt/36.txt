Termination for payment prematurely may only occur if the cause of termination is continuing at the time of the Agent's declaration. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned in Clause 13.1 (d).
If the right to terminate the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government authority, it is not necessaiy that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the period of appeal has expired in order for cause of termination to be deemed to exist.
