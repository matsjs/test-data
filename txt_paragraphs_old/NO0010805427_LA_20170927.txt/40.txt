10.1.1 The Outstanding Bonds shall be redeemed by the Issuer in full on the Maturity Date by payment of the Payoff Amount.
On each Interest Payment Date, the Issuer shall (as determined by the Issuer following consultation with the Advisory Committee), use funds equal to the Cash Sweep Amount (if any) to either: (i) redeem the Bonds at the Face Value; or (ii) conduct a buyback of Bonds (in each case as instructed by the Advisory Committee).
10.1.3 Partial repayments must be carried out pro rata in accordance with the procedures of the Securities Depository.
10.1.4 Bonds redeemed by the Issuer in accordance with this Clause 10.1 shall be discharged against the Outstanding Bonds.
10.1.5
If, prior to the Outstanding Bonds (plus any accrued and unpaid interest) having been redeemed in full, it has become evident, to the satisfaction of the Bond Trustee, that the basis for any further payment to the Bondholders (following a sale or other realisation of all assets of the Issuer and Refectio and distribution to the Bondholders) no longer exists, the Issuer shall in cooperation with the Bond Trustee be entitled to discharge the remaining Outstanding Bonds (and accrued and unpaid interest) without any further payments being made to the Bondholders in connection with a liquidation process of the Issuer and/or Refectio. Alternatively, the Bond Trustee may offer to the Bondholders to purchase their Outstanding Bonds at a price to be set in its own discretion to reflect that no further payments will be made to the Bondholders.
10.2 Voluntary early redemption - Call Option 10.2.1 The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Outstanding Bonds (the "Call Option") on any
Business Day from and including the Issue Date at the Face Value.
