The procedures and resolutions as set out in 16.2 and 16.3 above also apply for a repeated Bondholders' meeting, however, a valid resolution may be passed at a repeated Bondholders' meeting even though less than half (1/2) of the Voting Bonds are represented.
16.5.1
Anything which may be done by resolution of the Bondholders in a Bondholders' Meeting may be done by written resolution, without a Bondholders' Meeting, subject to the following conditions:
(a) Notice and use of a written resolution shall be made at the sole discretion of the Bond Trustee.
(b) Notice of a written resolution shall be given by the Bond Trustee, and a copy of the resolution shall be circulated to all Bondholders who would be entitled to attend a Bondholders' Meeting and vote thereon. The accidental omission to give notice to, or the non-receipt of a notice by, any Bondholder does not invalidate the passing of a resolution.
(c) A written resolution is passed when it is signed by or on behalf of the Bondholders who at the date that the notice is given represent such majority of votes as would be required if the resolution was voted on at a Bondholders' Meeting at which all Bondholders entitled to attend and vote thereat were present and voting.

(d) A resolution in writing may be signed in any number of counterparts.
(e) A resolution in writing made in accordance with this Bond Agreement is as valid as if it had been passed by the Bondholders in a Bondholders' Meeting, and any reference in any provision of this Bond Agreement to a Bondholders' Meeting at which a resolution is passed or to Bondholders voting in favour of a resolution shall be construed accordingly.
