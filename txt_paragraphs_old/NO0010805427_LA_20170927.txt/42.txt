10.4 Mandatory Prepayment
10.4.1
Upon the occurrence of a Mandatory Prepayment Event, the Issuer shall (even if the Mandatory Prepayment Event Proceeds are lower than the outstanding principal and interest on the Outstanding Bonds at that date) redeem all the Outstanding Bonds in full by paying to the Bondholders the lower of (i) the Mandatory Prepayment Event Proceeds and (ii) the Payoff Amount.
For the avoidance of doubt, if following completion of a sale or receipt of insurance proceeds the Issuer's funds exceed the amount of the Super Senior Bonds (including any Tap Issue) and the Existing Bonds plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, then all surplus funds shall be used to pay the final "profit" on the Existing Bonds.
