For the avoidance of doubt, if following completion of a sale or receipt of insurance proceeds the Issuer's funds exceed the amount of the Super Senior Bonds (including any Tap Issue) and the Existing Bonds plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, then all surplus funds shall be used to pay the final "profit" on the Existing Bonds.
On the settlement date of the Mandatory Prepayment, the Issuer shall pay to each of the Bondholders holding Outstanding Bonds, in respect of each such Outstanding Bond, its Pro Rata Share of the Mandatory Prepayment Event Proceeds or the Payoff Amount (as the case may be).
10.4.3
The Issuer shall notify the Bond Trustee in writing of any Mandatory Prepayment Event at least ten (10) Business Days prior to when the settlement date of the Mandatory Prepayment is expected to occur. The settlement date may, however, upon further notice to the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders, be reduced or prolonged, due to the settlement of the Mandatory Prepayment Event, but not with shorter notice than five (5) Business Days before the settlement day of the Mandatory Prepayment.
10.4.4
After completion of a Mandatory Prepayment that has not resulted in the sale of all the shares of the Issuer or Refectio, the Issuer shall be liquidated, and upon the completion of such liquidation the Issuer shall distribute to each Bondholder that held Outstanding Bonds at the date of settlement of the Mandatory Prepayment, its Pro Rata Share of any remaining cash held by the Issuer.
