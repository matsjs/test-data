(iii) agrees with the Bond Trustee that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify the Bond Trustee immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as a result of an Obligor not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under any Finance Document on the date when it would have been due. The amount payable by the Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the amount it would have had to pay under this Clause 12 (Guarantee) if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a guarantee.
This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by the Obligors under the Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
12.3 Reinstatement If any discharge, release or arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations of an Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by the Bond Trustee in whole or in part on the basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored in insolvency, liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then the liability of each Guarantor under this Clause 12 (Guarantee) will continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.

12.4 Waiver of defences The obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause 12 (Guarantee) will not be affected by an act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause 12 (Guarantee), would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause 12 (Guarantee) (without limitation and whether or not known to it, the Bond Trustee or any Bondholder) including:
(i) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other person;
(ii) the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any composition or arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group;
(iii) the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Obligor or other person or any non-presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security;
