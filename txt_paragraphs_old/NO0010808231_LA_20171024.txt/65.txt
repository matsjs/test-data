Notwithstanding the obligations of the Guarantors pursuant to this guarantee, the maximum guarantee liability of each Guarantor hereunder shall always be limited to EUR 100,000,000 plus any interest, default interest or other costs, fees and expenses related to the liability of that Guarantor hereunder.
If, and to the extent, the Norwegian Financial Agreements Act of 25 June 1999 no. 46 (the "FA Act") is applicable to these Bond Terms, each Guarantor waives all its rights under the provisions of the FA Act (not being mandatory provisions), including (without limitation) the rights set out in Sections 62 through 74 of the FA Act.
Parallel Debt (Covenant to Pay the Security Agent)
(a) In respect of ensuring the validity and enforceability of any Transaction Security Document governed by the law of The Netherlands, each Obligor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes to pay to the Security Agent as a creditor in its own right and not as a representative of the other Bondholders (by way of an abstract acknowledgment of debt) amounts equal to any amounts owing from time to time by that Obligor to the Bond Trustee, the Security Agent and/or any Bondholder under any Finance Document as and when those amounts are due for payment under the relevant Finance Document.
(b) Each Obligor and the Security Agent acknowledge that the obligations of an Obligor under paragraph (a) above are several and are separate and independent from, and shall not in any way limit or affect, the corresponding obligations of any Obligor to the Bond Trustee, the Security Agent and/or any Bondholder under any Finance Document (its "Corresponding Debt") nor shall the amounts for which an Obligor is liable under paragraph (a) (its "Parallel Debt") be limited or affected in any way by its Corresponding Debt provided that:
(i) the Parallel Debt of an Obligor shall be decreased to the extent that its Corresponding Debt has been irrevocably paid or (in the case of guarantee obligations) discharged;
(ii) the Corresponding Debt of an Obligor shall be decreased to the extent that its Parallel Debt has been irrevocably paid or (in the case of guarantee obligations) discharged; and
(iii) the amount of the Parallel Debt of an Obligor shall at all times be equal to the amount of its Corresponding Debt.
