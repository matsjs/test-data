No Guarantor shall cease to carry on its business (for the avoidance of doubt, a sale, transfer, winding-up, liquidation or other disposal of the Parent's onshore gas business in the Netherlands or the Ultimate Parent's interests in Germany will not constitute a cessation of business).
Corporate status
No Guarantor shall change its type of organization or jurisdiction of incorporation if such change would have a Material Adverse Effect.
14.29
Mergers and de-mergers
No Guarantor shall, and the Ultimate Parent shall procure that no other Group Company (other than the Issuer) will, carry out:
(a) any merger or other business combination or corporate reorganisation involving the consolidation of assets and obligations of a Guarantor or any other Group Company with any person other than with a Group Company and where the Guarantor is the surviving entity (and its obligations and liabilities under the Finance Documents continue in full force and effect); or
(b) any demerger or other corporate reorganisation having the same or equivalent effect as a demerger involving a Guarantor and any Group Company,
if such merger, demerger, combination or reorganisation would have a Material Adverse Effect.
