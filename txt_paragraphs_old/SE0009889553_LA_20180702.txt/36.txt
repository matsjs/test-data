decision regarding the Transaction Security. However, if the Bonds are not terminated due to
these Terms and Conditions, the Agent shall not enforce the Transaction Security. If the
Holders, without any prior initiative from the Agent or the Issuer, have made a decision
regarding termination of the Bonds and enforcement of the Transaction Security in
accordance with the procedures set out in Clauses 19 (Decisions by Holders), 20 (Holders'
Meeting) and 21 (Written Procedure), the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds
16
terminated and enforce the Transaction Security. The Agent is however not liable to take action if the Agent considers cause for termination and/or acceleration not to be at hand, unless the instructing Holders in writing commit to holding the Agent indemnified and, at the Agent's own discretion, grant sufficient security for the obligation.
