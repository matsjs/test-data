(a) to a Bondholder who is subject to the Taxes by reason of any present or former connection between the Bondholder and any governmental authority other than solely by the acquisition, holding or disposition of the Bonds or by the receipt of payments in respect of the Bonds or the enforcement of the rights hereunder,
(i) such compliance is required or imposed by law as a precondition to exemption from all or a part of the Tax; and
(ii) at least sixty (60) days prior to the first interest payment date with respect to which this Clause 17.4 will apply, the Borrower has notified the Bondholders that they will be required to comply with this requirement,
If a Bondholder determines in its reasonable discretion that it has received a refund of any Taxes in relation to which the Borrower has paid an additional amount, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of additional amounts paid by the Borrower), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Bondholder and without interest.
No Additional Amounts will be paid to a Bondholder that is a depositary or its nominee in respect of a Bond to the extent that the beneficial owner of such Bond would not have been entitled to receive payment of the Additional Amounts had the beneficial owner been the Bondholder of the Bond.
The Borrower will pay any present or future stamp, court, documentary or other similar taxes, charges or levies that arise from the execution, delivery or registration of, or enforcement of rights under, this Loan Agreement or any related document ("Documentary Taxes").
The Borrower's obligation to pay Additional Amounts and Documentary Taxes will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Loan Agreement.
