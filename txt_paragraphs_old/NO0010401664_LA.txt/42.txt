15.9 In the absence of a resolution of the directors of the Borrower fixing a record date for a Special Distribution or Rights Offering, the Borrower will be deemed to have fixed as the record date therefor the date on which the Special Distribution or Rights Offering is effected.
15.11 The Borrower covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized Shares (if the number thereof is or becomes limited) solely for the purpose of issue upon conversion of Bonds as provided herein, and allot for issue to Bondholders who may exercise their conversion rights hereunder, such number of Shares as shall then be issuable upon the conversion of all outstanding Bonds. All Shares which shall be so issuable shall, when issued, be duly and validly issued as fully paid and non-assessable.
15.12 If at any time, any order, ruling, registration, notice or filing pursuant to any securities laws of Canada or any province thereof is required to ensure that any Shares issuable upon the conversion of the Bonds are issued in compliance with all such laws or to

ensure that any such Shares, once issued, are not subject to any general restriction as to the resale thereof under the securities laws of Canada or any province thereof, the Borrower covenants that it will take all such action as may be necessary to make or obtain such order, ruling, registration or filing, or give such notice as the case may be.
15.13 All Bonds must be converted in whole and shall be forthwith delivered to and cancelled by the Paying Agent.
15.14 The Borrower shall from time to time, immediately after the occurrence of any event which requires an adjustment or readjustment as provided in Clause 15.1, deliver a Certificate of the Borrower to the Loan Trustee specifying the nature of the event requiring the same and the amount of the adjustment or readjustment necessitated thereby and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based and shall include the verification referred to below, if applicable, and the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to act and rely upon such Certificate of the Borrower. In the event that the readjustment changes the Conversion Price by more than five percent (5.00%), such Certificate of the Borrower and the amount of the adjustment specified therein shall be verified by an opinion of a Bogata (Colombia) office of a Canadian internationally recognized firm of chartered accountants appointed by the Borrower and consented to by the Loan Trustee acting reasonably and without delay (who may be the auditors of the Borrower) and shall be conclusive and binding on all parties in interest. Until such Certificate of the Borrower is received by the Loan Trustee, the Loan Trustee may act and be protected in acting on the presumption that no adjustment has been made or is required. Except in respect of any subdivision, re-division, reduction, combination or consolidation of the Shares, the Borrower shall forthwith give notice to the Bondholders specifying the event requiring such adjustment or readjustment and the amount thereof, including the resulting Conversion Price.
15.15 Subject to Clause 15.14, the Borrower covenants that, so long as any Bonds remain outstanding, it will give notice to the Loan Trustee and to the Bondholders of its intention to fix a record date for any event referred to in Clause 15.1(a), (b), (c), or (e) (other than the subdivision, re-division, reduction, combination or consolidation of Shares) or a cash dividend which may give rise to an adjustment in the Conversion Price, or other adjustment, and such notice shall specify the particulars of such event and the record date and the effective date for such event; provided that the Borrower shall only be required to specify in such notice such particulars of such event as shall have been fixed and determined on the date on which such notice is given. Such notice shall be given not less than fourteen (14) days prior to the applicable record date in the case of an event referred to in Clauses 15.1 (a), (b) or (c) and thirty (30) days prior to the applicable record date in the case of an event referred to in Clause 15.1 (e).
