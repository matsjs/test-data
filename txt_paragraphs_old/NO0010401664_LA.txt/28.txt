(b) the last day of the period is the last day of the month of February, in which case the month of February shall not be considered to be lengthened to a 30-day month.

In the event of such an election by the Borrower, the Borrower shall deliver a sufficient number of its Shares to the Selling Agent and the Selling Agent shall thereafter solicit bids for such delivered Shares from investment banks, brokers, dealers and other financial institutions as directed by the Borrower in the Borrower's sole discretion. In the event the Selling Agent sells a sufficient number of such Shares, it shall, on behalf of the Borrower, pay the proceeds thereof to the Loan Trustee in full satisfaction of the applicable interest in respect of which such election by the Borrower was made.
