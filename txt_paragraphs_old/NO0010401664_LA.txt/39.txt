To the extent that any Special Distribution is not so made, the Conversion Price will be readjusted effective immediately to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect based upon such securities or property or other assets as actually distributed.
(d) If the purchase price provided for in any rights, options or warrants (the "Rights Offering Price") referred to in Clauses 15.1 (b) or (c) is decreased, the Conversion Price will forthwith be changed so as to decrease the Conversion Price to the Conversion Price that would have been obtained if the adjustment to the Conversion Price made under Clauses 15.1 (b) or (c), as the

case may be, with respect to such rights, options or warrants had been made on the basis of the Rights Offering Price as so decreased, provided that the terms of this Clause 15.1 (d) will not apply to any decrease in the Rights Offering Price resulting from terms in any such rights, options or warrants designed to prevent dilution except to the extent that the resulting decrease in the Conversion Price under this Clause 15.1 (d) would be greater than the decrease, if any, in the Conversion Price to be made under the terms of this Clause by virtue of the occurrence of the event giving rise to such decrease in the Rights Offering Price.
(e) If and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Maturity Date, there is a reclassification of the Shares at any time outstanding or change of the Shares into other shares or into other securities or other capital reorganization (other than a Share Reorganization), or a consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger of the Borrower with or into any other corporation or other entity (other than a vertical short-form amalgamation with one or more of its Subsidiaries), or a transfer of the undertaking or assets of the Borrower as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to another corporation or other entity in which the holders of Shares are entitled to receive shares, other securities or other property, or a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Borrower (any of such events being called a "Capital Reorganization"), any Bondholder who exercises the right to convert Bonds into Shares pursuant to Bonds then held after the effective date of such Capital Reorganization will be entitled to receive, and will accept for the same aggregate consideration in lieu of the number of Shares to which such Bondholder was previously entitled upon such conversion, the aggregate number of shares, other securities or other property which such Bondholder would have been entitled to receive as a result of such Capital Reorganization if, on the effective date thereof, the Bondholder had been the registered holder of the number of Shares to which such holder was previously entitled upon conversion. The Borrower will take all steps necessary to ensure that, on a Capital Reorganization, the holders of Bonds will receive the aggregate number of shares, other securities or other property to which they are entitled as a result of the Capital Reorganization. Appropriate adjustments will be made as a result of any such Capital Reorganization in the application of the provisions set forth in this Clause 15.1 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of holders of Bonds to the end that the provisions set forth in this Clause 15.1 will thereafter correspondingly be made applicable as nearly as may reasonably be in relation to any shares, other securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of any Bond.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall not effect any Capital Reorganization unless, prior to or concurrent therewith, an appropriate adjustment to give effect to this subsection is made by and set forth in an amending agreement hereto or agreement with the Borrower's successor or such purchasing corporation or entity as applicable in each case approved by action of the Board of Directors of the Borrower and by the Loan Trustee, in which event such adjustment will for all purposes be conclusively deemed to be an appropriate adjustment, subject to the prior written consent of the Toronto Stock Exchange and any other applicable regulatory approval or
