14 Conversion - General Terms
14.1 Any conversion right or right of cash settlement hereunder is subject to the following terms and conditions (to the extent applicable):
(a) Notwithstanding the above, conversion of Bonds to new Shares can not take place prior to the due registration of the Bonds in the Securities Depository.
(b) The Bondholders hereby authorize the Paying Agent and/or the Loan Trustee each to provide directions to the Borrower with respect to the conversion of their respective Bonds and as to the registration of certificates representing Shares issuable to it upon such conversion as well as to the payment of any monies owing to them pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Borrower is entitled to rely upon any such directions received from the Loan Trustee and/or the Paying Agent and shall not be liable for any losses suffered by a Bondholder as a result of following any such direction.
(c) The Bondholders acknowledge that the certificates representing the Shares may be required to carry a legend setting forth certain transfer restrictions in respect of the Shares in accordance with applicable securities laws.
(d) No fractional Shares shall be issued. Any surplus cash after the conversion of the Bonds to Shares shall not be paid to the Bondholder and shall be retained by the Borrower.
(e) The holding of Bonds by the Bondholders shall not constitute the Bondholders as shareholders of the Borrower or entitle the Bondholders to any right or interest in respect thereof except as expressly provided for herein. Upon conversion of the Bonds in accordance with the terms hereof, the Bondholders of such converted Bonds shall be deemed as and from the date of any such conversion to be shareholders of the Borrower (unless the Borrower has elected to pay the Bondholder(s) cash pursuant to the terms of this Agreement upon such conversion) for all intents and purposes and shall cease to be Bondholders in respect of such converted Bonds and shall cease to have any further rights or claims under this Agreement other than the right to receive their Shares or cash proceeds issuable or payable, as the case may be, upon conversion.
