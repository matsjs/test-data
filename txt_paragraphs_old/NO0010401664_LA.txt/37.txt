such holders are entitled, during a period expiring not more than forty five (45) days after the date of such issue (the "Rights Period"), to subscribe for or purchase Shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into Shares at a price per share to the holder (or at an exchange or conversion price per share during the Rights Period to the holder in the case of securities exchangeable for or convertible into Shares) of less than 95% of the Current Market Price for the Shares on such record date (any of such events being called a "Rights Offering"), then the Conversion Price will be adjusted effective immediately after the end of the Rights Period so that it shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the end of the Rights Period by a fraction:
(i) the numerator of which will be the aggregate of:
A. the total number of Shares outstanding as of the record date for the Rights Offering, and
B. a number determined by dividing (I) either (x) the product of the number of Shares issued or subscribed for during the Rights Period upon the exercise of the rights, warrants or options under the Rights Offering and the price at which such Shares are offered, or, as the case may be, (y) the product of the exchange or conversion price of such securities exchangeable for or convertible into Shares and the number of Shares for or into which the securities so offered pursuant to the Rights Offering could have been exchanged or converted during the Rights Period, by (II) the Current Market Price of the Shares as of the record date for the Rights Offering, and
(ii) the denominator of which will be the number of Shares outstanding, or the number of Shares which would be outstanding if all the exchangeable or convertible securities were exchanged for or converted into Shares during the Rights Period, after giving effect to the Rights Offering and including the number of Shares actually issued or subscribed for during the Rights Period upon exercise of the rights, warrants or options under the Rights Offering.
Any Bondholder who has exercised the right to convert to Shares in accordance with Clause 13 during the period beginning immediately after the record date for a Rights Offering and ending on the last day of the Rights Period for the Rights Offering will, in addition to the Shares to which that holder would otherwise be entitled upon such conversion, be entitled to that number of additional Shares equal to the result obtained when the difference, if any, between the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the end of such Rights Offering and the Conversion Price as adjusted for such Rights Offering pursuant to this subsection is multiplied by the number of Shares received upon the conversion of the Bonds held by such Bondholder during such period, and the resulting product is divided by the Conversion Price as adjusted for such Rights Offering pursuant to this Clause 15.1 (b). Such additional Shares will be deemed to have been issued to the Bondholder immediately following the end of the Rights Period and a certificate for such
