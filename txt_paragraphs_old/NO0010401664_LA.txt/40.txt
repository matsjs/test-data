Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall not effect any Capital Reorganization unless, prior to or concurrent therewith, an appropriate adjustment to give effect to this subsection is made by and set forth in an amending agreement hereto or agreement with the Borrower's successor or such purchasing corporation or entity as applicable in each case approved by action of the Board of Directors of the Borrower and by the Loan Trustee, in which event such adjustment will for all purposes be conclusively deemed to be an appropriate adjustment, subject to the prior written consent of the Toronto Stock Exchange and any other applicable regulatory approval or

consent.
(f) If and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Maturity Date, the Borrower makes changes in the share capital other than those mentioned in Clauses 15.1 (a) - (e) above, which are unfavourable to the Bondholders compared to the shareholders of the Borrower, the Loan Trustee and the Borrower shall agree on a new Conversion Price. The principles expressed in Clauses 15.1 (a) - (e) above shall always be the basis for any adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Clause 15.1 (f).
15.2 In any case in which Clause 15.1 shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event referred to herein, the Borrower may defer, until the occurrence of such event, issuing to the Bondholder of any Bond converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional Shares issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event, provided, however, that the Borrower shall deliver to such Bondholder an appropriate instrument evidencing such Bondholder's right to receive such additional Shares upon the occurrence of such event and the right to receive any distributions made on such additional Shares declared in favour of holders of record o f Shares on and after the Conversion Date or such later date on which such Bondholder would, but for the provisions of this Clause 15.2, have become the holder of record of such additional Shares pursuant to Clause 13.
15.3 The adjustments provided for in Clause 15.1 are cumulative and will be made successively whenever an event referred to therein occurs, subject to the following subsections of this section, provided that, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require and increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Conversion Price then in effect provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Clause are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.
15.4 No adjustment in the Conversion Price will be required upon the issuance from time to time of Shares pursuant to any Share Compensation Plan, as such plans may be replaced, supplemented or further amended from time to time, or upon exercise of outstanding rights or agreements, including options, warrants and other convertible securities including any rights which have been granted or issued by the Borrower.
15.5 Subject to the prior consent of the Toronto Stock Exchange and any other applicable regulatory consent or approval, no adjustment in the Conversion Price will be made in respect of any event described in Clause 15.1 (a), (b) or (c), other than the events referred to in Clauses 15.1 (a) (iii) and (iv), if Bondholders are entitled to participate in such event on the same terms, mutatis mutandis, as if they had converted their Bonds prior to or on the effective date or record date of such event.
15.6 If at any time a dispute arises with respect to adjustments provided for in Clause 15.1, such dispute will be conclusively determined, subject to the Toronto Stock Exchange's consent and any other applicable regulatory approvals or consents, a Calgary office of a major Canadian, internationally recognized firm of independent chartered accountants as may be selected by action of the directors of the Borrower and approval by the Loan Trustee (without a Bondholders' meeting being and such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and any such determination will be binding
