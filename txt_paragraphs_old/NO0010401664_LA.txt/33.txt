11.1 In the event that payment of interest or principal is not made on the relevant Payment Date, the amount constituting such missed payment only (the "Missed Payment") (as opposed to the full amount of the Remaining Loan at such time) shall bear interest from the relevant Payment Date until actually paid at an interest rate of 8.375 per cent per annum.
12 Borrower's acquisition of Borrower's Bonds
12.1 The Borrower has, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the right to acquire for cancellation, and/or its Subsidiaries have the right to acquire and own, the Bonds. Bonds acquired by the Borrower shall be cancelled. Bonds acquired by any relevant Subsidiary may, at the discretion of such Subsidiary, be held, sold or used for partial redemption (discharge) of the Remaining Loan.
13 Bondholders' conversion rights
13.1 Each Bondholder may, on any Banking Day within the Exercise Period, and provided that the respective Bondholder at the time of conversion is allowed to own Shares according to applicable law, deliver a Conversion Request to its account manager in order to exercise its Conversion Rights (in full or in part). The Bondholder requesting conversion shall direct its account manager to promptly forward the Conversion Request to the Paying Agent.
13.2 Upon the Borrower's receipt of the Bondholder's Conversion Request, the Borrower shall, as soon as possible but in no event later than on the Conversion Date, issue to such Bondholder the number of new Shares which are necessary in order to fulfil the Borrower's obligations according to the Conversion Request. The Borrower shall no later than twenty (20) Banking Days after the Conversion Date register the new Shares on the Exchange (if applicable) and in the Securities Depository.
13.3 Conversion will be effected by a set-off of the total nominal value of the Bonds specified in the Conversion Request, against the issuing of the whole number of Shares resulting from dividing the total nominal value of such Bonds to be converted by the Conversion Price.
