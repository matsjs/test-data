additional Shares will be delivered to such Bondholder within fifteen (15) Business Days following the end of the Rights Period. To the extent that any such rights, options or warrants are not so exercised on or before the expiry thereof, the Conversion Price will be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect based on the number of Shares (or the securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) actually delivered on the exercise of such rights, options or warrants.
(c) If and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Maturity Date, the Borrower fixes a record date for the issue or the distribution to the holders of all or substantially all of the Shares of (i) securities of the Borrower, including rights, options or warrants to acquire securities of the Borrower or any of its property or assets and including evidences of indebtedness, or (ii) any property or other assets (including cash dividends and distribution of securities (including the Petrominerales Ltd. shares)), including evidences of indebtedness, and if such issuance or distribution does not constitute a Share Reorganization or a Rights Offering (any of such non-excluded events being called a "Special Distribution"), the Conversion Price will be adjusted effective immediately after such record date to a price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect on such record date by a fraction:
(i) the numerator of which will be:
A. the product of the number of Shares outstanding on such record date and the Current Market Price of the Shares on such record date; less
B. the fair market value, as determined by action by the directors of the Borrower, acting reasonably, (which determination, will be conclusive), to the holders of Shares of such securities or property or other assets so issued or distributed in the Special Distribution; and
(ii) the denominator of which will be the product of the number of Shares outstanding on such record date and the Current Market Price of the Shares on such record date.
To the extent that any Special Distribution is not so made, the Conversion Price will be readjusted effective immediately to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect based upon such securities or property or other assets as actually distributed.
The Borrower has the right to give all the Bondholders any offer, as an alternative to any adjustment according to this Clause 15.1. (c), which can be accepted (or declined) by all or a portion of the Bondholders.
