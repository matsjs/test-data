15.14 The Borrower shall from time to time, immediately after the occurrence of any event which requires an adjustment or readjustment as provided in Clause 15.1, deliver a Certificate of the Borrower to the Loan Trustee specifying the nature of the event requiring the same and the amount of the adjustment or readjustment necessitated thereby and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based and shall include the verification referred to below, if applicable, and the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to act and rely upon such Certificate of the Borrower. In the event that the readjustment changes the Conversion Price by more than five percent (5.00%), such Certificate of the Borrower and the amount of the adjustment specified therein shall be verified by an opinion of a Bogata (Colombia) office of a Canadian internationally recognized firm of chartered accountants appointed by the Borrower and consented to by the Loan Trustee acting reasonably and without delay (who may be the auditors of the Borrower) and shall be conclusive and binding on all parties in interest. Until such Certificate of the Borrower is received by the Loan Trustee, the Loan Trustee may act and be protected in acting on the presumption that no adjustment has been made or is required. Except in respect of any subdivision, re-division, reduction, combination or consolidation of the Shares, the Borrower shall forthwith give notice to the Bondholders specifying the event requiring such adjustment or readjustment and the amount thereof, including the resulting Conversion Price.
15.16 Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 15.15, the Borrower shall not be required to give the notice referred to in Clause 15.15 if the Borrower has given notice of a proposed Change of Control in accordance with the provisions of Clause 16.1 (j).
15.17 If changes are made to the share capital of the Borrower other than those mentioned above in this Clause 15, which are materially unfavourable to the Bondholders compared to shareholders of the Borrower, the Loan Trustee and the Borrower shall agree on a new Conversion Price as is equitable in the circumstances. The principles
