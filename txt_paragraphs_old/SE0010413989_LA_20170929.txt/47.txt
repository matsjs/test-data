(b) increased on a pro forma basis by an amount equal to the Net Finance Charges directly attributable to (i) any Financial Indebtedness owed by acquired entities referred to in the adjustment to EBITDA above, and (ii) any Financial Indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of such entities, in each case calculated as if all such debt had been incurred at the beginning of the relevant test period; and
(c) increased on a pro forma basis by an amount equal to the Net Finance Charges directly attributable to any new Financial Indebtedness, calculated as if such debt had been incurred at the beginning of the relevant test period.
