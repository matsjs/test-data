(e) The first Compliance Certificate to be delivered by the Issuer in accordance with paragraph (d)(i) and, if applicable, (ii) above shall be delivered by the
Issuer to the Agent for the period ending on the Reference Date falling 31 December 2017. The Agent may assume that any information provided by the Issuer in the Compliance Certificate is correct, and the Agent shall not be responsible or liable for the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of such information.
(f) The Issuer shall immediately notify the Agent (with full particulars) when the Issuer is or becomes aware of the occurrence of any event or circumstance which constitutes an Event of Default, or any event or circumstance which would (with the expiry of a grace period, the giving of notice, the making of any determination or any combination of any of the foregoing) constitute an Event of Default, and shall provide the Agent with such further information as it may reasonably request in writing following receipt of such notice. Should the Agent not receive such information, the Agent is entitled to assume that no such event or circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Agent does not have actual knowledge of such event or circumstance.
(g) The Issuer shall, promptly upon becoming aware of the same, inform the Agent of any claim, proceeding or investigation in respect of any such environmental law against any member of the Group which is current, pending or threatened where (i) if determined against that member of the Group, it would have or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) the relevant circumstances were not existing on the Issue Date or referred to in or as part of any information memorandum or other information provided to the investors in the Bonds in connection with the issue of Bonds.
(h) The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Agent according to this Clause 11.1 if informing the Agent would not conflict with any applicable laws or, when the Bonds are listed, the Issuer's registration contract with the MTF. If such a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with the MTF or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek approval from the MTF or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Agent, in order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to this Clause 11.1.
(i) When and for as long as the Bonds are listed, the financial reports mentioned in paragraph 11.1(a)(i) and 11.1(a)(ii) above shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles and made available in accordance with the rules and regulations of Nasdaq First North Bond Market (as amended from time to time) and the Swedish Securities Market Act.
11.2 Information from the Agent
Subject to the restrictions of any applicable law and regulation, the Agent is entitled to disclose to the Bondholders any event or circumstance directly or indirectly relating to the Issuer or the Bonds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agent may if it considers it to be beneficial to the interests of the Bondholders delay disclosure or refrain from disclosing certain information other than in respect of an Event of Default that has occurred and is continuing.
