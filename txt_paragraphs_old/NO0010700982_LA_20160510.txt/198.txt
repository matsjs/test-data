16.2 If any tax or other sum must be deducted from any amount payable by the Guarantor under this Guarantee, the Guarantor will pay such additional amounts as are necessary to ensure that the recipient receives a net amount equal to the full amount it would have received before such
16.3 No payment by the Guarantor (whether under a court order or otherwise) will discharge the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder unless and until the Finance Parties have received payment in full in the currency in which the obligation is denominated. If, on conversion into that currency, the amount of the payment falls short of the amount of the obligation concerned, the Finance Parties will have a separate cause of action
against the Guarantor for the shortfall.
16.4 Any certification or determination by the Bond Trustee of an amount payable by the Guarantor under this Guarantee is, in the absence of manifest error, prima facie evidence of that amount.
16.5 If the Guarantor makes a payment pursuant to this clause 16 (Paym ents) and the Bond Trustee determines that:
16.5.1 a Tax Credit is attributable either to an increased payment of which that payment forms part or to that payment; and
16.5.2 the Bond Trustee has obtained, utilised and retained that Tax Credit,
16.5.3
the Bond Trustee shall pay an amount to the Guarantor which the Bond Trustee determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after tax position as it would have been if such payment had not been required to be made by the Guarantor.
