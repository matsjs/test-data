REM EDIES
17.1 The Rights created by this Guarantee are in addition to any other Rights of the Finance Parties against the Guarantor under any other documentation, the general law or otherwise. They will not merge with or limit those other Rights, and are not limited by them.
17.2 No failure by a Finance Party to exercise any Right under this Guarantee will operate as a waiver of that Right. Nor will a single or partial exercise of a Right by a Finance Party preclude its further exercise.
17.3 If, at any time, any provision of this Guarantee is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under any law of any jurisdiction,
neither the legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions nor the legality, validity or enforceability of that provision in any other respect or under the law of any other jurisdiction will be affected or impaired in any way.
