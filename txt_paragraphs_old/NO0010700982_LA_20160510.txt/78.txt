45 (forty five) days after the relevant Mexican Drilling Contract's execution date or, in the case of the Rig 5 Mexican Drilling Contract, after the Amendment Date;
(vi) that all Bareboat Charters shall have a Bareboat Rate reflecting the day rate under the relevant Drilling Contract, LESS fees or discounts made in connection with the financing of receivables under such Drilling Contract under a Qualified Receivables Financing, LESS operational expenses, general and administrative expenses and risk allocation between the relevant Charterer and the relevant Rig Owner thereunder, as well as on the basis of applicable tax rules, PLUS VAT or other Taxes that the relevant Rig Owner shall be required to pay to the Mexican authorities in connection with the hire payments;
(vii) that Drilling Contracts may only be entered into under a different structure than described in this Clause if required for tax or operational purposes and provided that the Bond Trustee (in the opinion of the Bond Trustee) obtains a no less favourable security position under such structure as contemplated in this Bond Agreement. Any structure related to a non-Mexican Drilling Contract will be adapted to applicable local laws and will include a security package and earnings waterfall mechanism ensuring that the Bareboat Rate under any Bareboat Charters relating to any non-Mexican Drilling Contracts shall be paid to the relevant Rig Owner Earnings Account with as little delay as permitted by law;
(viii) to procure that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries shall, under any Bareboat Charter, remain responsible for all operating costs relating to the relevant Rigs;
(ix) that, in the event a Quiet Enjoyment Letter is required by a Client under a Drilling Contract, such Quiet Enjoyment Letter may only be issued by the Bond Trustee if the undertakings set out therein are substantially similar to the following text: "The Bond Trustee may not interrupt the quiet use, possession and enjoyment of the Rig by the end-user, so long as no event of default is continuing which would entitle the Charterer to terminate the Drilling Contract and except as required by any applicable law binding on the Bond Trustee, and provided that the end-user, following receipt of notice of an event of default under the Bond Agreement makes
52/96
due payments as instructed by the Bond Trustee in accordance with the Assignment of Drilling Contract. The exercise by the Bond Trustee of its rights under the Bond Agreement or any other Finance Document will not constitute such an interruption. Upon the default by the Charterer under the Drilling Contract, the end user may terminate the Drilling Contract pursuant to its terms after first providing the Bond Trustee with a 30 (thirty) days' notice of such default and provided that the Bond Trustee (or its nominee) shall have a right to remedy such default by assuming the obligations of the Charterer thereunder."; and
(x) to procure that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, which is continuing, the Bond Trustee shall have the right to terminate some or all of the Service Agreements, subject to the terms and conditions thereof.
