STATUS OF THE BONDS
By subscribing for Bonds, each Bondholder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Bondholder confirms such agreement.
The nominal amount of each Bond is SEK 500,000 (the "Nominal Amount"). The minimum permissible investment amount upon issuance of the Bonds is SEK 1,000,000 (the Minimum Investment"). The maximum total nominal amount of the Initial Bonds is SEK 200,000,000. All Initial Bonds are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 100.00 per cent of the Nominal Amount.
Provided that (i) no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue, the Issuer may, at one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Bonds. Subsequent Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate, the nominal amount and the final maturity applicable to the Initial

Bonds shall apply to Subsequent Notes. The price of the Subsequent Bonds may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal Amount. The maximum total nominal amount of the Bonds (the Initial Bonds and all Subsequent Bonds) may not exceed SEK 500,000,000. Each Subsequent Bond shall entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with Clause 8.1, and otherwise have the same rights as the Initial Bonds.
