(2) provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Company under the Indenture;
(4) add Guarantees with respect to the Notes;
(5) secure the Notes;
(6) add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company;
(7) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder;
(8) provide for the appointment of a successor trustee; provided that the successor trustee is otherwise qualified and eligible to act as such under the terms of the Indenture; or
(9) conform the text of the Indenture or the Notes to any provision of this "Description of notes" to the extent that such provision in this "Description of notes" is intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture or the Notes.
The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or supplement. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or supplement. A consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver under the Indenture by any holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such holder's Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. After an amendment or supplement under the Indenture becomes effective, the Company is required to mail to the holders a notice briefly describing such amendment or supplement. However, the failure to give such notice to all the holders, or any defect in the notice will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment or supplement.
