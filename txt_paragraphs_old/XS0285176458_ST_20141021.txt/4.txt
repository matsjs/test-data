(1) 1.0% of the then outstanding principal amount of such Note and
(2) the excess (to the extent positive) of:
(a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the principal amount of such Note plus (ii) all required interest payments due on such Note to and including February 1, 2017 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest), computed using a discount rate equal to the Bund Rate as of such redemption date plus 50 basis points, over
