Description of notes
The Company will issue the Notes under the Indenture (the "Indenture") between itself and Deutsche Bank Trustee Company Limited as trustee (the "Trustee") dated February 8, 2007. The Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, although the issuance of notes in this offering will be limited to 300 million. We may issue an unlimited principal amount of additional notes having identical terms and conditions as the Notes other than issue date, issue price and the first interest payment date (the "Additional Notes"). We will only be permitted to issue such Additional Notes if at the time of such issuance, we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. Any Additional Notes will be part of the same issue as the Notes that we are currently offering and will vote on all matters with the holders of the Notes.
This description of notes is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and the Indenture and the rights of holders of the Notes. Since this description of notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Indenture for a complete description of the obligations of the Company and your rights.

For purposes of this description, references to "the Company," "we," "our" and "us" refer only to Stena AB (publ) and not to its subsidiaries.
