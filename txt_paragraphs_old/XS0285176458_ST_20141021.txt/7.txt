(vi) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that could have been avoided by the presentation (where presentation is required) by or on behalf of a holder of the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union; or
nor shall additional amounts be paid with respect to any payment of the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any Note to any Holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or limited liability company or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent such payment would be required by the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction to be included in the income for tax purposes of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership, limited liability company or beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to such additional amounts had it been the Holder of such Note.
At least 10 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and payable (unless such obligation to pay additional amounts arises shortly before or after the 10th day prior to such date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Company will be obligated to pay additional amounts with respect to such payment, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating the fact that such additional amounts will be

The Indenture will further provide that, if the Company conducts business in any jurisdiction (an "Additional Taxing Jurisdiction") other than a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and, as a result, is required by the law of such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction to deduct or withhold any amount on account of taxes imposed by such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction from payments under the Notes, as the case may be, which would not have been required to be so deducted or withheld but for such conduct of business in such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction, the additional amounts provision described above shall be considered to apply to such holders as if references in such provision to taxes included taxes imposed by way of deduction or withholding by any such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority therein).
Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this description of the Notes there are mentioned, in any context:
(1) the payment of principal,
(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes,
