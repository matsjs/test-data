Payments on the notes; paying agent and registrar
We will pay principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes at the office or agency designated by the Company in London, England, except that we may, at our option, pay interest on the Notes by check mailed to holders of the Notes at their registered address as it appears in the Registrar's books. In addition, we shall maintain an office or agency in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, where global Notes may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange. We have initially designated the corporate trust office of the Trustee in London, England to act as our Paying Agent and Registrar. In addition, the Company appointed Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as Registrar, Principal Paying Agent, and Transfer Agent in Luxembourg. We may, however, change the Paying Agent or Registrar without prior notice to the holders of the Notes, and the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar, provided that, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such stock exchange so require, the Company will appoint a person in The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg who is reasonably acceptable to the Trustee as an additional Principal Paying Agent for the Notes.
We will pay principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, Notes in global form registered in the name of or held by the Common Depositary or its nominee in immediately available funds to the Common Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered holder of such global Note.
