(5) failure by the Company to comply for 60 days after notice as provided below with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;
(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness ("payment default"); or
(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "cross acceleration provision");
and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to 30 million or more;
(7) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the "bankruptcy provisions"); or
(8) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of 30 million (net of any amounts that a reputable and creditworthy insurance company has acknowledged liability for in
102
writing), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the date on which the right to appeal has expired (the "judgment default provision").
However, a default under clauses (4) and (5) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the default and the Company does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (4) and (5) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.
