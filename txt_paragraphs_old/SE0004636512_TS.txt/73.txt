(ii) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of any Material Group Company or any of its assets; or
(iii) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction;
(h) any Material Group Company is merged and/or demerged into a company which is not a Group Company, unless the Bond Trustee has given its consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) in writing prior to the merger and/or demerger (where consent is not to be understood as a waiver of the rights that applicable law at the time assigns the concerned creditors);
(i) any expropriation, attachment, sequestration, distress or execution or any analogous process in any jurisdiction affects any asset or assets of any Material Group Company having an aggregate value of an amount equal to SEK ten million (10,000,000) and is not discharged within thirty (30) days;

16.2 If the Bonds are declared due and payable, the Company shall redeem the Bonds at a redemption amount equal to the Bonds' Nominal Amount plus the accrued interest, if any, pursuant to Section 10 (Interest) from, but excluding, the preceding Interest Payment Date (or, if such date has not occurred, the Issue Date), up to and including the payment date.
16.3 Termination for payment prematurely on the grounds mentioned in Sections 16.1 (b), (c), (d) and (e) or, regarding any of the Company's Subsidiaries, on the grounds mentioned in Sections 16.1 (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) may only occur if the nature of the particular circumstance is such that it would have a Material Adverse Effect and that the cause of termination is continuing at the time of the Bond Trustee's declaration. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned in Section 16.1 (f).
