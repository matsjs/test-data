(b) The Bond Trustee may resign as agent and security trustee and/or transfer its position as agent and security trustee at any time, provided that no resignation by the Bond Trustee shall take effect until a new Bond Trustee has been appointed by the Company. If the Company has not appointed a new Bond Trustee within thirty (30) days after the Bond Trustee has given the Company notice of its resignation, the Bond Trustee has the right to appoint a new Bond Trustee.

(e) The Company may also appoint a new Bond Trustee or Issuing Agent which immediately shall replace the present Bond Trustee or Issuing Agent, if the Bond Trustee or Issuing Agent has, in a material way, failed to fulfil its obligations under these Terms and Conditions or the other Finance Documents and does not, within a reasonable time, remedy such failure after the Company has made the Bond Trustee or the Issuing Agent aware thereof. If a new Bond Trustee is appointed, the Company may recover all costs, remuneration, fees and expenses payable by the Company in relation to the new Bond Trustee under Sections 17.2 (f), 17.4 and 19 from the replaced Bond Trustee, provided that such costs, remuneration, fees and expenses exceed the costs, remuneration, fees and expenses that would have been payable if the Bond Trustee had not been replaced.
(f) If the Bond Trustee or the Issuing Agent have resigned or been replaced in accordance with Sections 17.3 (a) ­ (e), the Bond Trustee and the Issuing Agent shall deliver all documents and provide all information to the new Bond Trustee or Issuing Agent that are necessary for them to perform their obligations under these Terms and Conditions or the other Finance Documents.
17.4 Remuneration for the Bond Trustee
The Bond Trustee is, according to the Agent Agreement, entitled to receive remuneration from the Company for acting as Bond Trustee in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the other Finance Documents. If the Bond Trustee, based on good reasons, believes that the Company is or will become insolvent and not be able to reimburse the Bond Trustee for its costs and expenses (taking into account Section 22.1), the Bond Trustee is entitled to reserve reasonable remuneration from the Holders for its continued work in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the other Finance Documents, save that the Bond Trustee shall make the arrangements stated in Sections 16.8 ­ 16.9 without first having received remuneration or being indemnified by the Holders.
