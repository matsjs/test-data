4.3 The Bond Trustee will hold the security created under the Pledge Agreements on behalf of itself and the Holders in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the terms and conditions of the Pledge Agreements.
4.4 Except if otherwise decided by the Holders according to the procedures set out in Section 18 (Holders' meeting and procedure in writing), the Bond Trustee is, without first having to obtain the Holders' consent, entitled to enter into binding agreements with the Company, UK SPV, their Subsidiaries or third parties if it is, in the Bond Trustee's sole discretion, necessary for the purpose of maintaining, releasing or enforcing the security created under the Pledge Agreements or for the purpose of settling the various Holders' relative rights to the security created under the Pledge Agreements, respectively.
4.5 If the Bonds are declared due and payable according to Section 16 (Acceleration of the Bonds), the Bond Trustee is, without first having to obtain the Holders' consent, entitled to enforce the security created under the Pledge Agreements, in such manner and under such conditions that the Bond Trustee finds acceptable (if in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreements).
