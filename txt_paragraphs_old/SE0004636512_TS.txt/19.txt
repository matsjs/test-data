Diamorph's technology is based upon sintering, creating ceramics and composites from powders. The Company's approach is to be a solutions provider. It works closely with industrial partners to develop and produce advanced materials and components. Thus, Diamorph has a continuously expanding product portfolio. To date, its diverse product portfolio consists of:
 Rollers for tile production kilns and flat screen monitors
 Aerospace components for civil and military flying platforms
 Hybrid bearing components for wind turbines, high speed trains and power generators
 Wear-resistant components for wear protection used in heavy equipment
 Ballistic plates for personal, vehicle, naval and aircraft protection
 Next generation nuclear fuel for Gen-IV nuclear reactors
The main product which has a significant revenue stream is ceramic rollers. Other products are currently in developmental phase with industrial partners, or are available on the market in limited quantities. Near-term, Diamorph's intention is to scale up production of products already on the market. Currently, the Company's customers include large industrial companies in Europe. The Company sells to customers based in 30 different countries, and is therefore not dependent upon any single customer for its revenues for any of its products with the exception of its aeronautic components. Diamorph custom develops and manufactures each of its aeronautic components for Saab Group according to specific requirements.
