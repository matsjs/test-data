The Issuer intends, and shall use its best efforts, to (i) list the Notes on the corporate bond list of Nasdaq Stockholm or, if such admission to trading is not possible to obtain or maintain, admit the Notes to trading on another Regulated Market within thirty (30) calendar days from the Issue Date, and (ii) ensure that the Notes, once admitted to trading on the relevant Regulated Market, continue being listed thereon (however, taking into account the rules and regulations of the relevant Regulated Market and the CSD (as amended from time to time) preventing trading in the Notes in close connection to the redemption of the Notes and taking into account that if the Notes are listed on another Regulated Market than Nasdaq Stockholm, the Issuer may always apply for a change of listing to Nasdaq Stockholm).
