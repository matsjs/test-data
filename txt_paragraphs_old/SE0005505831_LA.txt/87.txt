For the avoidance of doubt, the Bonds cannot be terminated and become due for payment prematurely according to this Clause 15 without relevant decision by the Bond Trustee or following instructions from the Holders' pursuant to Clause 17 (Decisions by Holders).
DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS
All payments by the Issuer or the Guarantor (as applicable) relating to the Bonds and the Finance Documents following a termination of the Bonds in accordance with Clause 15 (Termination of the Bonds) shall be distributed in the following order of priority, in accordance with the instructions of the Bond Trustee:
(a) first, in or towards payment pro rata of (i) all unpaid fees, costs, expenses and indemnities payable by the Issuer to the Bond Trustee, (ii) other costs, expenses and indemnities relating to the termination of the Bonds or the protection of the Holders' rights, (iii) any non-reimbursed costs incurred by the Bond Trustee for external experts, and (iv) any non-reimbursed costs and expenses incurred by the Bond Trustee in relation to a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure;
(b) secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of accrued but unpaid Interest under the Bonds (Interest due on an earlier Interest Payment Date to be paid before any Interest due on a later Interest Payment Date);
(c) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid principal under the Bonds; and
(d) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under the Finance Documents.
Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer or the Guarantor (as applicable). The application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal.
If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in Clause 16.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way of a corresponding distribution in accordance with Clause 16.1.
