APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THE BOND TRUSTEE
By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Holder appoints the Bond Trustee to act as its agent and security trustee in all matters relating to the Bonds and the Finance Documents, and authorises the Bond Trustee to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent, unless such consent is specifically required by these Terms and Conditions) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Bonds held by such Holder. By acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Holder confirms such appointment and authorisation for the Bond Trustee to act on its behalf.
Each Holder shall immediately upon request by the Bond Trustee provide the Bond Trustee with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance satisfactory to the Bond Trustee), as the Bond Trustee deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents. The Bond Trustee is under no obligation to represent a Holder which does not comply with such request.

The Bond Trustee is entitled to fees for its work and to be indemnified for costs, losses and liabilities on the terms set out in the Finance Documents and the Bond Trustee's obligations as Bond Trustee under the Finance Documents are conditioned upon the due payment of such fees and indemnifications.
