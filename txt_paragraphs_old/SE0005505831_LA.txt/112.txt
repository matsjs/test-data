NO DIRECT ACTIONS BY HOLDERS
Clause 23.1 shall not apply if the Bond Trustee has been instructed by the Holders in accordance with the Finance Documents to take certain actions but fails for any reason to take, or is unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a Holder to provide documents in accordance with Clause 21.1.2), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Bond Trustee under the Finance Documents or the Agent Agreement or by any reason described in Clause 21.2.8, such failure must continue for at least 40 Banking Days after notice pursuant to Clause 21.2.9 before a Holder may take any action referred to in Clause 23.1.
