The calculation of the Gearing Ratio shall be made as per a testing date determined by
application of the Incurrence Test. The Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on
the relevant testing date so determined, but include the full undrawn (if any)
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and any existing New Debt and take
into account (whichever is relevant):
(i) the full commitment of the new Financial Indebtedness (excluding any Permitted Hedging Obligations, Shareholder Loans, and any interest bearing debt borrowed from and between any Group Company (including but not limited to Intercompany Loans)), provided it is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of such new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt);
(ii) the Restricted Disposal; or
(iii) the Restricted De-Merger,
in respect of which the Incurrence Test is applied. The EBITDA shall be calculated as set out in paragraph (c) below.
