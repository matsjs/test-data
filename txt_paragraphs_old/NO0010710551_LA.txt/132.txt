The Issuer shall ensure that Subsidiaries becoming Guarantors or having granted an Intercompany Loan to the Issuer accede to the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Parties shall procure that any additional security interest created (and any guarantee or indemnity granted) in respect of any Secured Obligations (including any New Security) shall be extended to and shared between the Secured Parties in accordance with the principles set out in "Ranking of security" and "Application of proceeds" in Part I.
The Obligors shall use all reasonable endeavours to facilitate any necessary establishment of additional security or change of Security Documents pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.
Turnover:
The Intercreditor Agreement shall include provisions for turnover of funds in the event of any creditor receiving payment in conflict with these intercreditor principles or the Bond Agreement. The payment waterfall provisions shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, apply regardless of any security documents not being (for whatever reason) valid or enforceable in respect of the relevant Secured Party.
Enforcement:
Subject to certain exceptions, the right to issue enforcement instructions to the Bond Trustee (in its capacity as security agent for the Secured Parties) shall in the event of conflicting enforcement instructions first go to the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the bondholders) alone. If (i) enforcement has not commenced within 3 months after an initial enforcement notice has been delivered to the Bond Trustee (in its capacity as security agent) by either the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the bondholders) or the RCF Creditors (whichever is first) (the "Initial Enforcement Notice") or (ii) all Secured Obligations owed to the RCF Creditors (the "RCF Liabilities") have not been fully discharged within 6 months after the Initial Enforcement Notice, then the right to instruct shall shift to the RCF Creditors alone, provided that an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility has occurred and is continuing.
Hedging Counterparties may not take any action to enforce any Security (without the written consent of the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the bondholders)) and the RCF Creditors.
