"Permitted Hedging Obligations" means any obligation of any Group Company under a derivative transaction in connection with protection against or benefit from fluctuation in any rate or price, where such exposure arises in the ordinary course of business or in respect of payments to be made under the Bond Agreement or the RCF Finance Documents (but not a derivative transaction for investment or speculative purposes). Any Permitted Hedging Obligation may be secured by the Post-Settlement Security, which shall be shared between the Secured Parties, on a pari passu and pro rata basis in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and any additional security as permitted under paragraph (c) of the definition of "Permitted Security".
