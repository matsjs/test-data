11.3.2
(a) 0.5 per cent, from the Interest Payment Date following immediately after an Equity Contribution in the Issuer of SEK 100,000,000 has occurred (taking into account the rules and regulations of the CSD); and
(b) 1 per cent, from the Interest Payment Date following immediately after an Equity Contribution in the Issuer of in total SEK 200,000,000 (including any contribution already made under paragraph (a) above) has occurred (taking into account the rules and regulations of the CSD).
If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it under the Finance Documents on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from, but excluding, the due date up to and including the date of actual payment at a rate which is 200 basis points higher than the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Trustee or the CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
REDEMPTION AND REPURCHASE OF THE BONDS
Redemption at maturity
The Issuer shall redeem all, but not only some, of the Bonds in full on the Final Redemption Date (or, to the extent such day is not a Business Day and if permitted under the CSD's applicable regulations, on the Business Day following from an application of the Business Day Convention, and otherwise on the first following Business Day) with an amount per Bond equal to the Nominal Amount, together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
The Issuer's purchase of Bonds
The Issuer may at any time purchase Bonds. Bonds held by the Issuer must be cancelled.
