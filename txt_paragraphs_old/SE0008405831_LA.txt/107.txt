Upon request by a Holder, the Trustee shall promptly distribute to the Holders any information from such Holder which relates to the Bonds (at the discretion of the Trustee). The Trustee may require that the requesting Holder reimburses any costs or expenses incurred, or to be incurred, by the Trustee in doing so (including a reasonable fee for the work of the Trustee) before any such information is distributed. The Trustee shall upon request by a Holder disclose the identity of any other Holder who has consented to the Trustee in doing so.
When acting in accordance with the Finance Documents, the Trustee is always acting with binding effect on behalf of the Holders. The Trustee shall carry out its duties under the Finance Documents in a reasonable, proficient and professional manner, with reasonable care and skill.
The Trustee is entitled to delegate its duties to other professional parties, but the Trustee shall remain liable for the actions of such parties under the Finance Documents.
The Trustee shall treat all Holders equally and, when acting pursuant to the Finance Documents, act with regard only to the interests of the Holders and shall not be required to have regard to the interests or to act upon or comply with any direction or request of any other Person, other than as explicitly stated in the Finance Documents.
The Trustee shall be entitled to disclose to the Holders any event or circumstance directly or indirectly relating to the Issuer or the Bonds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee may if it considers it to be beneficial to the interests of the Holders delay disclosure or refrain from disclosing certain information other than in respect of an Event of Default that has occurred and is continuing.
