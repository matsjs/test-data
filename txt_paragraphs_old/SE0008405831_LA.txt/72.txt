TERMINATION OF THE BONDS
14.1
The Trustee is entitled, on behalf of the Holders, to terminate the Bonds and to declare all,
but not only some, of the Bonds due for payment immediately or at such later date as the
Trustee determines (such later date not falling later than 20 Business Days from the date on
which the Trustee made such declaration), if:
(a) Non-payment: The Issuer fails to pay an amount on the date it is due in accordance with the Finance Documents unless its failure to pay is caused by administrative or technical error and payment is made within 5 Business Days of the due date;
(b) Other obligations: The Issuer does not comply with the Finance Documents, in any other way than as set out under (a) above, provided that the Trustee has requested the Issuer in writing to remedy such failure and the Issuer has not remedied the failure within 15 Business Days from such request (if the failure or violation is not capable of being remedied, the Trustee may declare the Bonds payable without such prior written request);
