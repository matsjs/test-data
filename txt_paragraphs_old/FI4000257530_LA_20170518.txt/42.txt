(30/360-days basis).
If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it on its due date, default interest shall
accrue on the overdue amount from (and including) the due date up to (but excluding) the
date of actual payment at a rate which is two (2) percentage points higher than the Interest
Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue
where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Agent, the Issuing Agent or the CSD,
in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
