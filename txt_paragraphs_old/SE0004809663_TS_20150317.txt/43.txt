Financial Indebtedness
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that no other Group Company shall, incur any new Financial Indebtedness (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the issuance of any Subsequent Notes and guarantees for Financial Indebtedness owed by other Group Companies) unless the Net Leverage Ratio tested pro forma including such incurrence is below 3.0:1, calculated as per a testing date falling no more than one month prior to the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness. For the purpose of calculating the Net Leverage Ratio, the figures for EBITDA set out in the latest financial statements published pursuant to Clause 10.1 (a) or (b) (including, when necessary, financial statements published before the First Issue Date) shall be used, but adjusted so that entities acquired or disposed after the end of the measurement period but before the relevant testing date will be included or excluded (as applicable) for the entire measurement period, and the amount of Net Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date but include the new Financial Indebtedness (for the avoidance of doubt, the new Financial Indebtedness shall increase the Net Debt but any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Debt).
