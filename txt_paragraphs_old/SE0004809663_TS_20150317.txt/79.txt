applies even if a Relevant Party itself takes such measures, or is subject to such measures.
Damage that may arise for a Noteholder shall not be indemnified by a Relevant Party if it
has observed normal care. A Relevant Party shall never be responsible for indirect damage
with exception of gross negligence and wilful misconduct. For the Agent, Clause 8.3.1
shall apply instead of this Clause 22.2.
22.3
Should an obstacle described above arise which prevents a Relevant Party from taking any
action required to comply with these Terms and Conditions, such action may be postponed
until the obstacle has been removed.
