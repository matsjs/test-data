18.2 Limitations on enforcement under the Intercreditor Agreement
The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions regulating the rights of the Super Senior Creditors and the Bondholders (the "Secured Creditors") which will prevail over the enforcement provisions of this Bond Agreement, including the following limitations on the right to instruct the Security Agent to enforce the Security Interests.
18.2.2
