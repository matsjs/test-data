13.5.3 The Incurrence Test is met if the Leverage Ratio for the Group (on a consolidated basis) is not greater than 3.00 and the Interest Coverage Ratio for the Group (on a consolidated basis) exceeds 2.00.
The calculation of the Leverage Ratio shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no earlier than the date of the last financial quarter prior to the event relevant for the application of the Incurrence Test.
The Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date however so determined that the full commitment of the new Financial Indebtedness, provided it is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of such new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt in respect of which the Incurrence Test is applied) shall be taken into account.
The calculation of the Interest Coverage Ratio shall be made for the Relevant Period ending on the last day of the period covered by the most recent Financial Report.
The figures for the EBITDA and Net Interest Expenses for the Relevant Period ending on the last day of the period covered by the most recent Financial Report shall be used for the Incurrence Test, but adjusted so that:
(a) entities acquired or disposed of by the Group during the Relevant Period, or after the end of the Relevant Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be included or excluded (as applicable), pro forma, for the entire Relevant Period;
(b) any entity to be acquired with the proceeds from the new Financial Indebtedness shall be included, pro forma, for the entire Relevant Period.
