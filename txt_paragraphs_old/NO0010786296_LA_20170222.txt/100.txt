AGREED SECURITY PRINCIPLES
The Security shall be shared between the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the bondholders) and the Super Senior Creditors in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Bond Trustee will act as security agent on behalf of the Secured Creditors, both in respect of the Security and any additional security provided in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Intercreditor Agreement shall include waterfall provisions where after the payment obligations under the Super Senior Finance Documents shall rank above the payment obligations under the Bond Finance Documents with respect to the proceeds upon enforcement (including distressed disposals) of the Security.
In determining what Security should be provided in support of the Secured Debt, the following matters will be taken into account. Security shall only be created or perfected to the extent that it would not:
