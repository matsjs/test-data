(c) any time from and including the first Business Day falling thirty (30) months after the First Issue Date to, but excluding, the Final Maturity Date at an amount per Note equal to 100.75 per cent. of the Nominal Amount, together with accrued but unpaid Interest; and
For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer may not redeem any outstanding Notes prior to the First Call Date.
Redemption in accordance with Clause 10.3.1 shall be made by the Issuer giving not less than fifteen (15) Business Days' notice and not more than thirty (30) Business Days' notice to the Noteholders and the Agent, in each case calculated from the effective date of the notice. The Notice from the Issuer shall specify the Redemption Date and also the Record Date on which a person shall be registered as a Noteholder to receive the amounts due on such Redemption Date. The notice is irrevocable but may, at the Issuer's discretion, contain one or more conditions precedent. Upon fulfilment of the conditions precedent (if any), the Issuer is bound to redeem the Notes in full at the applicable amount on the specified Redemption Date.
Early redemption due to illegality and repurchase due to a tax event (call option)
The Issuer may redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Notes at an amount per Note equal to 100 per cent of the Nominal Amount, together with accrued but unpaid Interest on a Redemption Date determined by the Issuer if it is or becomes unlawful for the Issuer to perform its obligations under the Finance Documents.
The Issuer may repurchase the relevant Notes if, as a result of any change in, or amendment to, laws or regulations in Sweden, which amendment or change is effective on or after the First Issue Date, the Issuer has or will become required to pay any Additional Amount in relation to such Notes and this obligation cannot be avoided by reasonable measures available to the Issuer. Each such affected Note shall be repurchased at an amount equal to 100 per cent of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
