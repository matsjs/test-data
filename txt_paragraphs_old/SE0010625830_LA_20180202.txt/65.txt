If Noteholders representing more than eighty-five (85) per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount have requested that Notes held by them are repurchased pursuant to this Clause 10.5, the Issuer shall, no later than five (5) Business Days after the end of the period referred to in Clause 10.5.1 or 10.5.2, send a notice to the remaining Noteholders, if any, giving them a further opportunity to request that Notes held by them be repurchased on the same terms during a period of twenty (20) Business Days from the date such notice is effective. Such notice shall specify the Redemption Date, the Record Date on which a person shall be registered as a Noteholder to receive the amounts due on such Redemption Date and also include instructions about the actions that a Noteholder needs to take if it wants Notes held by it to be repurchased.
