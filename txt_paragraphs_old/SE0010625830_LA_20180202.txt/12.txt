"Material Adverse Effect" means a material adverse effect on (a) the business, financial condition or operations of the Group taken as a whole, (b) the Issuer's ability to perform
and comply with its payment undertakings under the Finance Documents, (c) the validity or enforceability of the Finance Documents, or (d) the effectiveness or ranking of any Transaction Security.
"Material Subsidiary" means (i) a Guarantor, and (ii) a Subsidiary of the Issuer which, together with its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation calculated on the same basis as EBITDA representing 7.5 per cent. or more of EBITDA or has turnover or gross assets representing 7.5 per cent. or more of the turnover or gross assets of the Group, in each case calculated on a consolidated basis, calculated by reference to the financial statements most recently made available on the Issuer's website in accordance with Clause 12.1.1.
For this purpose:
(i) the contribution of the Group Company will be determined from its financial statements (consolidated if it has Subsidiaries) upon which the latest audited financial statements of the Group have been based;
(ii) if it becomes a Group Company after the date on which the latest audited financial statements of the Group have been prepared, the contribution of that Group Company will be determined from its latest audited financial statements (the first test date for any such company shall be the date on which it becomes a Group Company);
(iii) the EBITDA, turnover and gross assets of the Group will be determined from its latest audited financial statements, adjusted (where appropriate) to reflect the EBITDA, turnover and gross assets of any company or business subsequently acquired or disposed of;
(iv) if a Material Subsidiary disposes of all or substantially all of its assets to another Group Company, it will immediately cease to be a Material Subsidiary and the other Group Company (if it is not already) will immediately become a Material Subsidiary; the subsequent financial statements of those Group Companies and the Group will be used to determine whether those Group Companies are Material Subsidiaries or not;
(v) if a Group Company is not wholly owned (directly or indirectly) by the Issuer, the EBITDA and turnover of that Group Company shall when determining whether that Group Company is a Material Subsidiary be adjusted and calculated pro rata to the ownership portion held by the Issuer (directly or indirectly) in that Group Company; and
