APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THE AGENT
Appointment of the Agent
By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder:
(a) appoints the Agent to act as its agent in all matters relating to the Notes and the Finance Documents, and authorises the Agent to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent, unless such consent is specifically required by these Terms and Conditions) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Notes held by such Noteholder, including the winding-up, dissolution, liquidation, company reorganisation (foretagsrekonstruktion) or bankruptcy (konkurs) (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction) of the Issuer; and
(b) confirms the appointment under the Intercreditor Agreement of the Security Agent to act as its agent in all matter relating to the Transaction Security, the Security Documents, the Guarantees and the Guarantee Agreement, including any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the perfection, preservation, protection or enforcement of the Transaction Security or a Guarantee and acknowledges and agrees that the rights, obligations, role of and limitation of liability for the Security Agent is further regulated in the Intercreditor Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will represent the Secured Parties in inter alia, holding the Transaction Security and the Guarantees pursuant to the Security Documents and the Guarantee Agreement, and where relevant, enforcing the Security under the Escrow Account Pledge Agreement on behalf of the Secured Parties.
By acquiring Notes, each subsequent Noteholder confirms the appointment and authorisation for the Agent and the Security Agent to act on its behalf, as set forth in Clauses 21.1.1 and 21.1.2.
Each Noteholder shall immediately upon request provide the Agent with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent), that the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents. The Agent is under no obligation to represent a Noteholder which does not comply with such request.
