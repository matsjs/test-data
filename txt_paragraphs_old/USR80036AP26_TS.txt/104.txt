Other Activities. Total operating revenue from Other Activities decreased by approximately 16.7% to NOK1,931 million in 2002 from NOK2,319 million in 2001. Other industry in Norway
produced operating revenues of NOK682 million in 2002, a decline of 26.7% from NOK930 million in 2001. Other revenues declined by NOK140 million, or 10.1%, from NOK1,389 million in 2001 to NOK1,249 million in 2002. The decline in Other Activities is primarily due to our deconsolidation of our interest in the Union Geithus company, together with a reduction of revenues from our particleboard mill in Norway and certain other minor divestitures.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses in 2002 decreased by approximately 14.6% to NOK21,565 million from NOK25,258 million in 2001. The decrease in our overall operating expenses was primarily due to our deconsolidation of NorskeCanada and the general strengthening of the Norwegian kroner, which was partly offset by the acquisition of Walsum and Parenco.
Cost of materials decreased by approximately 9.6% to NOK10,559 million in 2002 compared to NOK11,679 million in 2001. This decrease primarily resulted from the deconsolidation of NorskeCanada and the general strengthening of the Norwegian kroner, which was partly offset by the acquisition of Walsum and Parenco and an increase in recovered paper prices from 2001 to 2002.
Wages, salaries and personnel expenses decreased by approximately 10.1% to NOK3,514 million in 2002 compared to NOK3,909 million in 2001. The decline in salaries and personnel expenses mainly reflects the deconsolidation of NorskeCanada and the general strengthening of the Norwegian kroner, which was partly offset by the acquisition of Walsum and Parenco.
Depreciation and amortization decreased slightly by NOK31 million to NOK3,292 million in 2002 from NOK3,323 million in 2001, of which NOK252 million in 2002 relates to amortization of goodwill compared to NOK253 million in 2001.
Other operating expenses decreased by approximately 28% to NOK4,406 million in 2002 from NOK6,117 million in 2001 primarily as a result of a decrease in distribution costs combined with a decrease in costs for maintenance materials and service as well as the deconsolidation of NorskeCanada and the general strengthening of the Norwegian kroner, which was partly offset by the acquisition of Walsum and Parenco.
The following is a discussion of the operating expenses incurred by each of our business areas and by Other Activities.
