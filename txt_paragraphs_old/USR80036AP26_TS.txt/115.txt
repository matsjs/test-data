We are exposed to currency risk in the following areas:
· Transaction Risk, which arises as a result of our positive cash flow being predominantly in foreign currencies, while our negative cash flow is predominantly in Norwegian kroner.
Balance Sheet Risk
Balance sheet risk arises when our accounts are consolidated in Norwegian kroner and translation differences arise on assets and debt denominated in foreign currencies. The value of
36
our assets and debt are adjusted for this translation difference, thereby affecting important key ratios such as our gearing ratio (net interest-bearing debt to equity). Balance sheet risk is managed by ensuring that our net debt is denominated in a mix of currencies in which we also hold assets, in order to reduce fluctuations in key financial ratios resulting from currency rate movements. For practical reasons, we also use forward contracts to reduce our balance sheet risk.
We follow the requirements for hedge accounting under Norwegian GAAP.
The following table shows the balance sheet effect of changes in exchange rates during the six months ended June 30, 2003.
