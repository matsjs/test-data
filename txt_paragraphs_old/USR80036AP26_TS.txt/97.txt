Six Months Ended June 30, 2003 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2002
Operating revenue comprises the operating revenue realized by each of our business areas and by other activities. Operating revenue in the first half of 2003 decreased slightly by 1.7% to NOK11,382 million from NOK11,574 million in the first half of 2002. The decrease in overall revenue is primarily attributable to declines in the Australasia and Asia regions due to lower prices and currency translation effects due to a stronger Norwegian kroner in the first half of 2003, which was partly offset by an increase in deliveries.

The following is a discussion of the operating revenue realized by each of our business areas and by our Other Activities.
Europe. Our operating revenue in Europe consists mainly of sales of our newsprint and magazine paper production. Total operating revenue in Europe remained essentially flat at NOK6,886 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK6,870 million in the first half of 2002, primarily as a result of increases in revenue for magazine paper being offset by decreases in revenue for newsprint.
Operating revenue for newsprint decreased by NOK173 million to NOK3,548 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003 from NOK3,721 million for the six months ended June 30, 2002. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower sales prices.
Operating revenue for magazine paper increased by NOK189 million to NOK3,338 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003 from NOK3,149 million for the six months ended June 30, 2002. The increase is primarily attributable to a higher delivery volume of 648,000 tonnes for the six months ended June 30, 2003, compared to 559,000 tonnes for the six months ended June 30, 2002, which was only partly offset by lower prices.
Operating revenue for the first half of 2003 also includes approximately NOK178 million of gains from electricity trading, compared to approximately NOK20 million for the first half of 2002. The electricity trading gains occurred due to a combination of favorable pricing in the electricity market in Norway and surplus electricity due to downtime in our mills in Norway. These gains will not necessarily recur in the future.
Production of publication paper in Europe increased by 102,000 metric tonnes or 6.5% to 1.666.000 metric tonnes in the first half of 2003. Our newsprint paper is delivered, to a large extent, on the basis of annual contracts. As a result, our prices for newsprint are generally stable throughout the year.
