We operate a number of defined benefit and contribution plans throughout the world.
Net pension costs for the period are included in ''wages and personnel expenses'' and consist of the present value of pensions earned in the year, any change in the present value of pension liabilities, anticipated returns on pension scheme funds, the expensed portion of changes in estimated pension liabilities, the expensed portion of difference between actual and anticipated returns, and accrued social security costs.
The effect of changes in estimated and actual pension liabilities and the difference between actual and anticipated returns for any plan are accrued over the estimated remaining pension earning period or expected life when the cumulative effect exceeds 10% of the higher of the plan's assets and its liabilities.
