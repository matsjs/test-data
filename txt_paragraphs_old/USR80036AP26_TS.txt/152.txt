Our operations in Australasia are the only producers of newsprint in Australia and New Zealand. We have a market share of approximately 92% in Australia and 95% in New Zealand based on volume sold. Our operations in Australasia accounted for 16.5% of our operating revenue and 29.2% of our operating earnings in the first half of 2003. Our operations in Australasia sold 409,000 metric tonnes of newsprint in the first half of 2003 and 826,000 metric tonnes in 2002.
We have a unique market position in Australasia compared with the other regions of the world in which we operate. This is because we are the only domestic producer of newsprint and we have close integration with our customers. It is uneconomical, under most conditions, to ship newsprint to Australasia from the major newsprint producing regions of North America and Europe due to its geographic remoteness. Our production costs in Australasia are generally favorable compared to other regions.
Production Facilities. We have three paper mills in Australia and New Zealand with an annual production capacity of 945,000 metric tonnes of newsprint.
We believe our operations have the lowest delivered cash cost per metric tonne to Sydney, Australia of all our competitors. This is due to our access to an ample supply of virgin fiber, well-maintained assets, and a significant freight cost advantage due to the proximity of our mills to our customers compared to our principal competitors located in Asia. We acquired all of our Australasian mills from Fletcher Challenge Paper in July 2000.
The following table provides information on our production capacity and mills in Australasia as of June 30, 2003.
