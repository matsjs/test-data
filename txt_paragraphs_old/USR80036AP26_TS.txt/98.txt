Operating revenue for the first half of 2003 also includes approximately NOK178 million of gains from electricity trading, compared to approximately NOK20 million for the first half of 2002. The electricity trading gains occurred due to a combination of favorable pricing in the electricity market in Norway and surplus electricity due to downtime in our mills in Norway. These gains will not necessarily recur in the future.
South America. Our operating revenue in South America consists mainly of sales of newsprint production. Total operating revenue in South America in the first half of 2003 was NOK551 million a decrease of 3.2% from NOK569 million for the first half of 2002. This decrease is primarily the result of a decline in newsprint prices. Our operations in South America produced 161,000 metric tonnes of newsprint in the first half of 2003, which was a slight increase from our production of 157,000 metric tonnes in the first half of 2002. The average delivered price for our newsprint declined by 10% during the first half of 2003 compared to the first half of 2002. See ''Our Business--Locations of Operations--South America''.
Australasia. Our operating revenue in Australasia consists mainly of sales of our newsprint production. Total operating revenue in Australasia in the first half of 2003 was NOK1,874 million a decrease of NOK80 million from the first half of 2002. This decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in the benchmark price for newsprint on the west coast of the United States, which is the pricing basis for the yearly repricing of our contracts in Australasia. See ''Our Business--Locations of Operations--Australasia". Australasia produced 423.000 metric tonnes of newsprint in the first half of 2003. We increased our production by 9.000 metric tonnes during the first half of 2003 primarily due to an increase in market demand in Australia. The average realized price for our newsprint declined by 7% during the first half of 2003 compared to the first half of 2002.
Asia. Our operating revenue in Asia consists of sales of newsprint produced by PanAsia. We include 50% of PanAsia's operating revenue in our consolidated revenue. Our operating

revenue in Asia decreased by approximately 12.8% to NOK1,141 million in the first half of 2003 from NOK1,309 million in the first half of 2002 primarily as a result of a one-time increase in paper demand in South Korea during the preparations for the World Cup soccer tournament in 2002. In addition, a strike at a large mill of one of our principal competitors in the first half of 2002 shifted certain production orders to PanAsia. Production of standard and improved newsprint in Asia increased by 19,000 metric tonnes or 6.5% to 313,000 metric tonnes in the first half of 2003. Average realized prices for newsprint decreased by 4% in the first half of 2003 compared to the first half of 2002.
Other Activities. Other Activities includes other industry in Norway and other revenues. Other industry in Norway includes particleboards, Norwegian forests, hydro power and other minor activities. Other revenues include revenue from sales of paper by PanAsia which are not manufactured locally and revenues from wood and energy sold to external parties from our European activities. Total other activities increased by NOK164 million, a 17.4% increase to NOK1,106 million for the first half of 2003 compared to NOK942 million for the first half of 2002. The increase is principally due to a NOK250 million increase in other revenues to NOK850 million, which was only partially offset by a NOK86 million decrease in other industry in Norway, mainly due to the sales of our power generating assets. The increase in other revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of paper by PanAsia and energy trading.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses include the cost of materials, wages, salaries and other personnel expenses, ordinary depreciation and other operating expenses incurred by each of our business areas and by other activities. Operating expenses in the first half of 2003 increased by 2.7% to NOK10,696 million from NOK10,412 million in the first half of 2002. The increase in our overall operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in our cost of materials, in particular, due to increased production volumes. We are beginning to see the positive impact of our Improvement 2003 program, which made a positive contribution of NOK320 million to operating earnings for the first half of 2003. We believe we will achieve an improvement of NOK1 billion for the calendar year 2003 under this program, mainly in the form of cost reductions.
