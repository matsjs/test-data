In connection with our reorganization of our production and our sales and marketing groups, we have also centralized the operations of our supply and logistics team. This group focuses on ensuring timely delivery of our products to our customers and on assisting with procuring the appropriate category and quantities of raw material for the mills. They work closely with the product management group and the mills to provide an efficient service to the customer. As with our other revised corporate management groups, the removal of a layer of management has allowed for a greater standardization of our procedures across Europe and for prompt access to senior management in Norway when necessary.
