Malaysian Newsprint Industries' principal market is Malaysia with some sales to Singapore and some export volumes to other parts of Asia. In 2002, Malaysian Newsprint Industries' shares of the Malaysia and Singapore newsprint markets was 75% and 24%, respectively. In Malaysia, five leading publishing groups represent over 74% of the demand for newsprint. Two of these publishing groups are direct shareholders of Malaysian Newsprint Industries and represent 25% of the demand for newsprint in Malaysia. These shareholders and another publisher have contracts with Malaysian Newsprint Industries to purchase 100,000 metric tonnes of Malaysian Newsprint Industries' production each year. This is equal to approximately 40% of Malaysian Newsprint Industries' annual production.
