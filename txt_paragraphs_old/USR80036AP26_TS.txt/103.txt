Operating Revenue
The following is a discussion of the operating revenue realized by each of our business areas and by our other activities.
Europe. Our operating revenue in Europe decreased marginally by NOK132 million to NOK14,087 million in 2002 compared to NOK14,219 million in 2001. This was primarily the result of a reduction in the price of newsprint in 2002 compared to 2001, which was partly offset by the additional sales volumes following from the acquisition of Walsum and Parenco.
Production of publication paper in Europe increased by 575,000 metric tonnes or 22.0% to 3.192.000 metric tonnes in 2002. Production of newsprint increased by 155,000 metric tonnes, or 8.8%, to 1,925,000 metric tonnes in 2002. Production of magazine paper increased by 420.000 metric tonnes, or 49.6%, to 1,267,000 metric tonnes. The increase in production of newsprint and magazine papers is primarily attributable to our acquisitions of the Walsum and Parenco mills. Our newsprint is delivered on the basis of annual contracts and our uncoated magazine paper is delivered to a large extent on the basis of annual contracts, so that prices for both are generally stable throughout the year. New annual contracts for 2002 resulted in average realized newsprint prices decreasing by 10% in 2002 compared to 2001 and average realized uncoated magazine paper prices decreasing by 10% in 2002 compared to 2001. Average realized coated magazine paper prices decreased by 12% in 2002 compared to 2001. These price reductions reflect general developments in the market for magazine paper prices.
South America. Our operating revenue in South America decreased by approximately 42.9% to NOK1,107 million in 2002 from NOK1,939 million in 2001, primarily as a result of prices declines, which was combined with the exchange rate impact of a weaker Brazilian real compared to the Norwegian kroner. Our operations in South America produced 332,000 metric tonnes of newsprint in 2002, a 5.7% increase from 2001.
Australasia. Our operating revenue in Australasia decreased by approximately 14.9% to NOK3,807 million in 2002 from NOK4,473 million in 2001 primarily as a result of a 7% price decline in newsprint in the second half of 2002 and the divestiture of our pulp mill in New Zealand in 2001. Our operations in Australasia produced 832,000 metric tonnes of newsprint in 2002, a 1.8% increase from 817,000 metric tonnes in 2001.
Asia. The operating revenue from our share of PanAsia's operations increased by approximately 10.4% to NOK2,688 million in 2002 from NOK2,434 million in 2001, primarily as a result of the 16.7% increase in our share of PanAsia in August 2001. The production of newsprint of our share of PanAsia's operations increased by 163,000 metric tonnes or 34.8% to 635,000 metric tonnes in 2002, largely as a result of the increased demand due to the World Cup soccer tournament in South Korea, a strike at one of our competitors and our increased share of ownership in PanAsia.
Other Activities. Total operating revenue from Other Activities decreased by approximately 16.7% to NOK1,931 million in 2002 from NOK2,319 million in 2001. Other industry in Norway
