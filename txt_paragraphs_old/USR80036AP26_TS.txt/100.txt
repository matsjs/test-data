The following is a discussion of the operating expenses incurred by each of our business areas and by Other Activities.
South America. Our operating expenses in South America mainly consist of expenses we incur in the production of newsprint. Total operating expenses in South America decreased by approximately 16.4% to NOK488 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK584 million in the first half of 2002. This decrease is primarily the result of the termination on March 31, 2003 of our Norske Skog Klabin joint venture in Brazil. See ''Our Business--Locations of Operations--South America.''
Australasia. Our operating expenses in Australasia mainly consist of the expenses incurred in the production of newsprint. Total operating expenses in Australasia increased by approxi mately 5.5% to NOK1,674 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK1,587 in the first half of 2002. This increase occurred principally as a result of a rise in energy prices in New Zealand and recovered paper prices in Australia.
Asia. Our operating expenses in Asia mainly consist of expenses incurred in the production of newsprint by PanAsia. Total operating expenses in Asia remained essentially flat, increasing by NOK7 million to NOK1,007 million in the first half of 2003 from NOK1,000 million in the first half of 2002.
Other Activities. The operating expenses of other activities increased by approximately 20.9% to NOK1,115 million in the first half of 2003 from NOK922 million in the first half of 2002, primarily due to increases in the volume of paper sold by PanAsia on behalf of third parties and energy sold to third parties.
Operating Earnings
Our operating earnings in the first half of 2003 declined by 41.0% to NOK685 million from NOK1,162 million in the first half of 2002 and was 6.0% as a percentage of operating revenue compared to 10.0% in the first half of 2002. The decline in operating earnings occurred because of a combination of a 1.7% decline in operating revenues and a 2.7% increase in operating expenses, which was largely due to an increase in our production of 5.5%.
