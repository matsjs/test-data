Notes to the Norske Skogindustrier ASA Consolidated Financial Statements -- (Continued)
At the Shareholders meeting held on 29 April 2002 the Board of Directors were given the authority to acquire up to 10% of the company's shares on certain conditions. The authority was given for a period of 18 months.
During 2002 the shareholders' equity of Norske Skog has been reduced by NOK 1 951 million due to the strengthening of the NOK compared to the currencies of the other countries where the Group operates. The reduction of the equity is related to the translation of foreign subsidiaries from local currencies to NOK. In particular it is the strengthening of the NOK compared to USD, AUD, NZD and EUR that contributes to the negative effect on the equity.
