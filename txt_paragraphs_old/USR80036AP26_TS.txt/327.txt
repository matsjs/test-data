The large cash-reserve in 2001 is partly a result of a divestment of forest in Brazil. This divestment took place late in 2001, and the cash was not utilised before 2002. A considerable part of the cash-reserve at 31 December 2001 was used for downpayment of debt in the first quarter of 2002. In addition the Group has reduced its requirement related to a strategic cash reserve. This reserve is placed in interest bearing securities.
The Group has limited access to liquid assets in joint ventures and in companies with large minority interests. In 2002 this amounts to NOK 141 million.
