We believe that the four PanAsia mills are the premier newsprint assets in Asia (excluding Japan) and are among the lowest cost production facilities in the world. The average age of the newsprint machines at the mills is approximately nine years. The PanAsia mills are strategically located in a region which we believe will have one of the highest long-term growth rates for newsprint demand in the world.
Production Facilities. PanAsia is the largest producer of publication paper in Asia (excluding Japan) based on annual production capacity and controls four paper mills located in Korea, China, and Thailand with the capacity to produce 1,460,000 metric tonnes of newsprint and groundwood specialty paper. Malaysian Newsprint Industries has one mill located in Malaysia with the capacity to produce 250,000 metric tonnes of newsprint.
We believe PanAsia's newsprint operations are among the lowest cost production facilities in the world, in terms of delivered cash cost per metric tonne to Hong Kong, China.
The following table provides information on production capacity and mills controlled by PanAsia and Malaysian Newspaper Industries as of June 30, 2003.
