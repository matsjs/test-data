We believe that our relationship with all of the unions representing our employees are generally good.
Environmental
The pulp and paper production process generates effluent containing organic compounds and nutrients, which can lead to eutrophication and a lack of oxygen in vulnerable water environments. In addition, most of our paper mills generate air emissions. The air emissions are mainly the result of energy production from the burning of biofuel and fossil fuel. The main air emissions are sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulate (ash and dust), in addition to carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuel.
With the exception of the Bio Bio and Boyer mills, all of our mills have biological waste water treatment plants that remove organic compounds from the waste water and significantly
