We own our operations within Norway. However, outside of Norway our subsidiaries conduct the majority of our operations and directly own the majority of our assets. Our subsidiaries have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amount under the notes or to make any funds available for such payment. Therefore, our operating cash flow and our ability to meet our debt obligations, including the notes, will depend on the cash flow provided by our subsidiaries in the form of loans, dividends or other payments to us as a shareholder. Additional indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries may restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other similar payments to us. In the event of the insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of one of our subsidiaries, all creditors of such subsidiary would be entitled to payment in full out of the assets of such subsidiary before we, as a shareholder, would be entitled to any payments. Creditors of subsidiaries might have to be paid in full before our creditors, including holders of our debt securities, and might be entitled to receive any payment from the assets of such subsidiary.
