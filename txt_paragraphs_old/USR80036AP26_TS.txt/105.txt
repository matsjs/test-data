Other operating expenses decreased by approximately 28% to NOK4,406 million in 2002 from NOK6,117 million in 2001 primarily as a result of a decrease in distribution costs combined with a decrease in costs for maintenance materials and service as well as the deconsolidation of NorskeCanada and the general strengthening of the Norwegian kroner, which was partly offset by the acquisition of Walsum and Parenco.
Europe. Our operating expenses in Europe increased by approximately 17.6% to NOK12,898 million in 2002 compared to NOK10,972 million in 2001. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to our acquisition of the Walsum and Parenco mills in August 2001.
South America. Our operating expenses in South America decreased by approximately 23.9% to NOK1,116 million in 2002 compared to NOK1,466 in 2001 primarily as a result of the exchange rate impact of a weaker Brazilian real compared to the Norwegian kroner.
Australasia. Our operating expenses in Australasia decreased by approximately 13.0% to NOK3,261 million in 2002 compared to NOK3,748 in 2001 primarily as a result of the divestiture of our pulp mill in New Zealand in 2001.
Asia. Our operating expenses in Asia increased by approximately 16.9% to NOK2,126 million in 2002 from NOK1,818 million in 2001, mainly due to our 16.7% increase in our ownership of PanAsia.

Other Activities. The operating expenses of other activities decreased by approximately 15.2% to NOK1,884 million in 2002 from NOK2,221 million in 2001. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to the deconsolidation of our interest in the Union Geithus company.
Operating Earnings
Operating earnings in 2002 declined by 74.4% to NOK1,906 million, before restructuring costs of NOK600 million, from NOK5,096 million in 2001 and constituted 5.6% of operating revenue compared to 16.8% in 2001. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to the 22.7% decrease in operating revenue, which was only partly offset by a 14.6% decrease in our operating costs, including NOK600 million of restructuring costs associated with our Improvement 2003 program.
