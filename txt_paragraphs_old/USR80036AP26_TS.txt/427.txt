Notes to the Norske Skogindustrier ASA Consolidated Financial Statements -- (Continued)
Norske Skogindustrier ASA and subsidiaries do not pledge any assets as the loan agreements contain a negative pledge clause. This is not prevailing for PanAsia which has pledged some of its assets.
26. Environment
In 2002 the environmental investments were NOK 175 million. For 2001 the amount was NOK 70 million.
The greater part of the investments were made at Walsum, Parenco and Bio Bio. Walsum has carried out an extensive reconstruction of the effluent treatment plant with the objective to reduce the discharge of organic material (COD) by at least 20%. The objective has been reached.
Parenco has completed the construction of a new central dewatering plant for sludge from the de-inking process. Construction work on a new bio fuel boiler was started in the autumn 2002. The start-up of the boiler is planned for spring 2004.
At Bio Bio a new effluent treatment plant is under construction. The startup is planned for May 2003.
