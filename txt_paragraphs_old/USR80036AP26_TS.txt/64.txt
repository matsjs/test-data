Market Developments
Europe
European demand for newsprint in the first half of 2003 remained weak, in line with the previous year. In 2002, demand for newsprint, both standard and improved qualities, fell by 6% in Europe due to the weak economic climate and a decrease in advertising expenditure in most European countries. This decline was partly offset by a pick-up in demand from outside Europe and North America, with European exports increasing by close to 50%. Newsprint prices declined, from a historically high level in 2001, by approximately 10% in 2002 and dropped further by another approximately 10% for 2003. Export markets also provided low price levels for 2002, and industry-wide capacity utilization in Europe averaged 91% in 2002, down from 92% in 2001.
The weak economic climate and a decrease in advertising expenditure in most European countries is also influencing demand for various magazine paper grades. Demand for uncoated magazine paper has remained fairly stable in the first half of 2003 and prices have been low. Total deliveries of uncoated magazine paper to Western Europe decreased by 1% in 2002. Shipments of magazine papers to North America from Europe increased by 2% in 2002. The price of uncoated magazine paper in Europe and the United States declined by 5% from 2001 to 2002. Capacity utilization for the industry in Europe averaged 91.5% in 2002, down from 94% in 2001.
Demand for coated magazine paper increased by 3% during the first half of 2003 compared to 2002. Total deliveries of coated magazine paper to Europe increased by 2% in 2002, due to increased demand and increased prices for coated fine paper, a paper grade which competes against coated magazine paper. Prices of coated magazine paper declined by 11% in 2002 compared to 2001. Capacity utilization for the industry in Europe averaged 80% in 2002, down from 81% in 2001.
