Liquidity Risk
We have a policy of maintaining a minimum liquidity reserve of 20% of operating revenue, which as at June 30, 2003 amounted to NOK7,300 million. The liquidity reserve consists of available liquidity (cash and cash equivalents) as well as committed drawing facilities with banks. We maintain a minimum of NOK500 million in cash reserves that are held either in bank deposits or liquid securities. Our policy is to undertake transactions primarily with counterpar ties having high credit ratings. Counterparty credit limits are continuously monitored and reviewed.
