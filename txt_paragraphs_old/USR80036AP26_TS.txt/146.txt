Raw Materials. The principal raw material used by our European operations is pulp, which is made from wood or waste paper such as old newspapers and old magazines.
In 2002, 41% of our wood requirements in Europe came from Norwegian timber, 29% from non-Norwegian timber and 31% from sawmills in the form of woodchips. Our timber purchases represented approximately 39% of the timber harvested in Norway in 2002. We purchase timber in Norway pursuant to one-year contracts. In Norway, we obtain waste paper through long-term contracts with local communities. At our other European paper mills we obtain waste paper from multiple sources in Central Europe.
The primary types of pulp we use for the production of publication paper are TMP, other types of mechanical pulp, recycled pulp and small amounts of chemical pulp. In 2002, we estimate that 65% of our European pulp requirements were met by internally produced TMP and other types of mechanical pulp, 30% by internally produced recycled pulp and 5% by chemical pulp purchased from third parties.
Sales and Distribution. Our operations in Europe generally sell their products to newspapers, publishing houses and printers. By sales, the top three countries for our products in Europe are Germany, the United Kingdom and France. These three countries together comprise 39% of our European operations' sales in 2003.
