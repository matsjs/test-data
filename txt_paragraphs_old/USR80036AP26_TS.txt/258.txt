Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies
Financial instruments
Treatment of financial instruments for accounting purposes follows the intentions underlying the associated contract. At the time a contract is entered, it is defined either as a hedging or as a trading contract. The various types of financial instruments used for hedging interest risks are assessed as separate portfolios. The portfolios are then assessed at cost price or market value, whichever is the lower. In cases where the contracts entered are classified as hedging transactions, revenues and costs are accrued and classified in the same way as the underlying balance sheet items. Financial instruments in foreign currencies that are not classified as hedging for accounting purposes are assessed at market value.
Shares, bonds, certificates, bills etc.
Shares, bonds and certificates classified as current assets and which are regarded as part of a trading portfolio are valued at market value.
Shares classified as fixed assets that are not attributed to affiliated companies are strategic investments where the Group cannot be said to have any significant influence. These share holdings are valued at cost price, or possibly the fair value when a drop in value is of a permanent nature.
Inventory
Raw materials and other purchased goods are valued at purchase cost according to the FIFO principle. Finished goods are valued at production cost, which includes raw materials, energy, direct wages and a share of indirect costs, including ordinary maintenance and depreciation. The net selling value at a future selling date will be used if that is lower.
