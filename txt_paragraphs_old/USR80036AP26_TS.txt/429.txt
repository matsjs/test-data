Currency risk
Norske Skog has currency risk related to both Profit & Loss and the balance sheet.
Transaction risk
The Group has incoming and outgoing transactions in various currencies. The most important of these being EUR, NOK, USD, GBP, AUD and NZD. Transaction risk is the potential difference in the future value of outgoing or incoming funds in the different currencies. The Group calculates a 12-month future expected cash flow in each currency on a rolling basis. 50-100% of the Group's expected cash flows should be hedged at any time using either forwards/futures or currency options. Only 100% owned subsidiaries, where we have direct access to the cash flow, are included in the hedging.
The result of the hedging is included under ''Financial Items'' of Profit & Loss in the group accounts. In 2002, the cash flow hedging generated a profit of NOK 884 million. Currency loss or income will, over time, hedge increased or reduced future net operational income.
Translation risk
The group accounts are calculated in NOK. The translation risk arises when the subsidiaries' balance sheets are translated from their local currency to NOK. Norske Skog has been aiming to hedge the relationship between equity and debt (gearing) in 2002. This risk is secured at group level by group debt being drawn up in currency, as well as using short- and long forwards. This combination gives a currency spread that reflects the combination of net assets on the group balance sheet. Refer to table on page 20 which shows the composition of the debt related to the balance sheet hedge.
The currency result of the hedging is booked directly against the equity and is set off against translation differences from net equity at subsidiary level.
