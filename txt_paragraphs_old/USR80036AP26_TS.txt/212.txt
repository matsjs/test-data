Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described above and under ''Plan of Distribution", cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear account holders, on the other, will be effected in DTC in accordance with DTC rules and procedures and on behalf of Clearstream, Luxembourg or (as the case may be) Euroclear by its respective depositary. However, such cross market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Clearstream, Luxembourg or (as the case may be) Euroclear by the counter party in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines. Clearstream, Luxembourg or (as the case may be) Euroclear will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving beneficial interests in the relevant Global Note Certificate in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream, Luxembourg account holders and Euroclear account holders may not deliver instructions directly to the depositaries for Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear.
For a further description of restrictions on the transfer of Notes, see ''Plan of Distribution".
DTC has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes (including, without limitation, the presentation of Global Note Certificates for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more participants in whose account with DTC interests in Global Note Certificates are credited, and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Global Note Certificates as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, in certain circumstances, DTC will exchange the Global Note Certificates for Individual Note Certificates (which will, in the case for Restricted Notes, bear the legend set out above under ''--Transfer Restrictions").
Although DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Note Certificates among participants and account holders of DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither the Issuer, the Registrar, the Fiscal Agent nor any Transfer Agent or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear or their respective direct or indirect participants or

account holders of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their respective operations.
Modification of Terms and Conditions
The Global Note Certificates will contain provisions which modify the Terms and Conditions of the Notes as they apply to the Notes evidenced by the Global Note Certificates. The following is a summary of certain of those provisions:
Notices: Notwithstanding Condition 16 (Notices), so long as a Global Note Certificate is held on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other clearing system (an ''Alternative Clearing System''), notices to Holders of Notes represented by such Global Note Certificate may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or (as the case may be) such Alternative Clearing System; provided, however, that, so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and its rules so require, notices will also be published in a leading newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Meetings: The holder of a Global Note (unless such Global Note represents only one note) will be treated as being two persons for the purposes of any quorum requirements of a meeting of note holders and, at any such meeting, as having one vote in respect of each U.S.$1,000 principal amount of notes for which such Global Note may be exchanged.
