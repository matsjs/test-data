Our Australian operations benefit from long-term business relationships with three of the major publishers in Australia through supply contracts extending through 2010. These publishers account for a significant majority of domestic newsprint demand and most of our sales and we supply almost all of their newsprint requirements. Prices under these contracts are fixed annually in Australian dollars using a formula based on a premium over U.S. west coast transaction prices for newsprint. In addition, annual price movements are restricted by a cap/collar arrangement.
Competition. We are the only domestic producer of newsprint in Australia and New Zealand. Based on volume sold, we have approximately a 92% market share in newsprint in Australia and a 95% market share in newsprint in New Zealand. Only 75,000 metric tonnes, or 8% of Australian newsprint consumption, was imported into Australia in 2002, the majority of which was from Asia.
Partially Owned Companies
Asia
In Asia, we own 50% of PanAsia and 33.65% of Malaysian Newsprint Industries. PanAsia accounted for 10.0% of operating revenue and 19.6% of our operating earnings in the first
51
half of 2003. PanAsia delivered a total of 1,256,000 metric tonnes of newsprint in 2002 and 610,000 tonnes in the first half of 2003.
We believe that the four PanAsia mills are the premier newsprint assets in Asia (excluding Japan) and are among the lowest cost production facilities in the world. The average age of the newsprint machines at the mills is approximately nine years. The PanAsia mills are strategically located in a region which we believe will have one of the highest long-term growth rates for newsprint demand in the world.
We own 33.65% of Malaysian Newsprint Industries with the balance owned by three Malaysian groups, two of which are publishers. We account for Malaysian Newsprint Industries as an equity investment in our financial statements.
