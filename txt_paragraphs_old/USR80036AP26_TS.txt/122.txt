Transaction Risk
Our policy is to hedge between 50% to 100% of the following 12-month period's expected net cash flow per currency. Our aim is to even out the effect of currency fluctuations on our cash flow and to make it easier to predict our future earnings. For additional information about exchange rate risks see ''Risk Factors--Risks Relating to our Business--Exchange rate fluctua tions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations''.

Interest Rate Risk
There is a correlation between economic trends and interest rate movements, with interest rates falling during an economic downturn and rising in an economic upswing. We seek to structure the fixing of interest rates on our loans in a manner so that interest costs partly offset changes in revenue as a consequence of changes in the economic climate. To a large extent, our loans have floating interest rates that are fixed for periods of less than one year. Limits are set for fixing interest rates per currency. We also use derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks.
The following table sets forth our net interest cost and our average rate of interest for the periods indicated.
