For the 2033 Notes:
1. Form, Denomination and Status
(a) Form and Denomination: The Notes are in registered form in denominations of U.S.$1,000. Notes may be held in holdings of U.S.$1,000 and integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 (each an ''Authorized Holding'').
(b) Status: The Notes constitute direct, general and unconditional obligations of the Issuer which will at all times rank pari passu in right of payment without preference among
65
themselves and pari passu with all other present and future unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer, except for such obligations as may be preferred by provisions of law that are both mandatory and of general application.
2. Register, Title and Transfers
(a) Register: The Registrar will maintain a register (the ''Register'') in respect of the Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Agency Agreement. In these Conditions, the ''Holder'' of a Note means the person in whose name such Note is for the time being registered in the Register (or, in the case of a joint holding, the first named thereof) and ''Noteholder'' shall be construed accordingly. A certificate (each, a ''Note Certificate") will be issued to each Noteholder in respect of its registered holding.
(b) Title: The Holder of each Note shall (except as otherwise required by law) be treated as the absolute owner of such Note for all purposes (whether or not it is overdue and regardless of any notice of ownership, trust or any other interest therein, any writing on the Note Certificate relating thereto (other than the endorsed form of transfer) or any notice of any previous loss or theft of such Note Certificate) and no person shall be liable for so treating such Holder.
