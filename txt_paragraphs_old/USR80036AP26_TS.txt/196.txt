All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the Kingdom of Norway or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax (''Taxes''), unless such withholding or deduction is required by law or regulation of the Kingdom of Norway or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax. In that event, the Issuer shall pay such additional amounts (''Additional Amounts'') as will result in the receipt by the Noteholders of such amounts as would have been received by them if no such withholding or deduction had been required, except that no such Additional Amounts shall be payable in respect of any Note presented for payment:
(b) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or personal property tax or any similar Tax; or
(c) any Tax which is payable otherwise than by withholding from payments on or in respect of any Note; or
(d) any Tax which would not have been imposed but for the failure to comply with certification, information or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Noteholder or beneficial holder of such Note, if such compliance is required by statute or by regulation of the Kingdom of Norway or of any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax as a precondition to relief or exemption from such Tax; or
(e) where such withholding or deduction is imposed on a payment to an individual and is required to be made pursuant to any European Union Directive on the taxation of savings implementing the conclusions of the European Union Economic and Finance Ministers (''ECOFIN'') Council Meeting of November 26-27, 2000 or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive; or
(f) held by or on behalf of a Holder who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by arranging to receive the relevant payment through another Paying Agent; or
77
(g) where (in the case of a payment of principal or interest on redemption) the relevant Note Certificate is surrendered for payment more than 30 days after the Relevant Date except to the extent that such withholding or deduction would have been imposed, and the relevant Holder would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts, if it had surrendered the relevant Note Certificate or received a payment on the last day of such period of 30 days.
In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment on a Note to a Noteholder who is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent such payment would be required to be included in the income, for tax purposes, of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the holder of the Note.
