Operating Expenses
Cost of materials includes the cost of the raw materials for our production, principally comprising wood fiber, recovered paper, purchased market pulp, chemicals and energy. Cost of materials increased by approximately 5.8% to NOK5,440 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK5,144 million in the first half of 2002. On a cost per tonne basis, adjusting for currency fluctuations and production volumes, there was a reduction of approximately 2% per tonne from the first half of 2002 to the first half of 2003 for the mills which we wholly own.
Wages, salaries and personnel expenses include salaries, wages, pension costs, social security contributions and other benefits. Wages, salaries and personnel expenses decreased by approximately 2.1% to NOK1,737 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK1,775 million in the first half of 2002. The decline in salaries and personnel expenses reflects the initial results of personnel reduction efforts as part of our Improvement 2003 program.
Depreciation and amortization is principally made up of the annual depreciation of our fixed assets and amortization of goodwill. Depreciation and amortization decreased by approxi mately 5.0% to NOK1,621 million from NOK1,707 million in the first half of 2002. Of this

amount, NOK132 million relates to amortization of goodwill on our balance sheet for the first half of 2003. The amortization of goodwill principally relates to our acquisitions of Fletcher Challenge Paper in 2000 and of Walsum and Parenco in 2001.
Other operating expenses include distribution costs, packaging, contract services, marketing costs, administration costs and losses on bad debt. Other operating expenses decreased by approximately 3.0% to NOK2,133 million in the first half of 2003 from NOK2,199 million in the first half of 2002.
The following is a discussion of the operating expenses incurred by each of our business areas and by Other Activities.
Europe. Our operating expenses in Europe mainly consist of expenses we incur in the production of newsprint and magazine paper. Total operating expenses in Europe increased by approximately 3.8% to NOK6,383 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK6,152 million in the first half of 2002. This increase is primarily the result of a 6.4% increase in operating costs in magazine papers to NOK3,003 million for the first half of 2003, combined with a 1.5% increase in operating costs for newsprint to NOK3,380 million for the first half of 2003. The increase in costs for magazine papers is primarily due to higher production volumes.
