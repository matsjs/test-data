Auditor's Report for 2002
We have audited the annual financial statements of Norske Skogindustrier ASA as of 31 December 2002, showing a profit of NOK 1 031 million for the parent company and a profit of NOK 1 168 million for the Group. We have also audited the information in the Directors' report concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption, and the proposal for the allocation of profit. The financial statements comprise the balance sheet, the statements of income and cash flows, the accompanying notes and the consolidated accounts. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's Board of Directors and Managing Director. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and on other information according to the requirements of the Norwegian Act on Auditing and Auditors. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Norwegian Act on Auditing and Auditors and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway. Those standards and practices require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. To the extent required by law and auditing standards, an audit also comprises a review of the management of the Company's financial affairs and its accounting and internal control systems. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion
· the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with law and regulations and present the financial position of the Company and of the Group as of 31 December 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with accounting standards, principles and practices generally accepted in Norway · the Company's management has fulfilled its duty to properly register and document the accounting information as required by law and accounting standards, principles and practices generally accepted in Norway · the information in the Directors' report concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption, and the proposal for the appropriation of the profit is consistent with the financial statements and comply with law and regulations.
