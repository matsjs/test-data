Demand for newsprint in South America weakened in the first half of 2003 due to a generally weak regional economy. The decrease was 7% when compared with the first half of 2002, mainly due to a decrease in demand of 70% in Venezuela, 8% in Colombia and 4% in Brazil. Demand increased by 20% in Argentina during the second half of 2003 but this was from a low demand level in 2002.
Increased supply from North America was a factor in low price levels in Brazil. We expect that there will be an increase in prices per metric tonne in Brazil during the second half of 2003 and that other markets in South America will track this price increase.
During the second half of 2002, newsprint prices in Brazil declined significantly from price levels in 2001. Newsprint prices in Chile are also influenced by North American pricing and experienced similar decreases.
Australasia
Market demand in Australasia increased by 7% during the first half of 2003 compared with 2002. Effective from July 1, 2003, newsprint prices in Australia have been adjusted in accordance with long-term contracts. The new prices, in Australian dollars, are approximately 4% lower than the 2002 prices. Market conditions in 2002 were stable compared with 2001.

Asia
The price trend for newsprint in several Asian markets has been negative, while the prices for raw materials and energy have increased. Demand in the first half of 2003 essentially remained flat compared with the first half of 2002. Effective in the third quarter of 2003, a newsprint price increase has been announced for customers without annual sales contracts. Newsprint demand in Asia increased by about 6% in 2002 from a low level in 2001. Korea and China had particularly high levels of consumption, while Thailand experienced weaker market trends in both prices and volumes.
