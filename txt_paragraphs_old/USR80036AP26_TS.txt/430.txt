The group accounts are calculated in NOK. The translation risk arises when the subsidiaries' balance sheets are translated from their local currency to NOK. Norske Skog has been aiming to hedge the relationship between equity and debt (gearing) in 2002. This risk is secured at group level by group debt being drawn up in currency, as well as using short- and long forwards. This combination gives a currency spread that reflects the combination of net assets on the group balance sheet. Refer to table on page 20 which shows the composition of the debt related to the balance sheet hedge.
Use of forwards for adjusting currency allocation on debt will offer other liquidity outcomes linked to exchange rate movements, than the use of traditional currency debt.
Interest risk
Norske Skog considers a floating interest rate on its group debt to be risk reducing. This is related to the correlation between Norske Skog's income and economic cycles where the interest rate is normally high during economic boom and low during recessions.

Notes to the Norske Skogindustrier ASA Consolidated Financial Statements -- (Continued)
The Group has outstanding certificates and fixed interest rate bonds with a nominal value of NOK 8 903 million. The switch to floating interest payments on existing fixed interest loans is achieved by using interest rate swaps. The economic risk on the debt portfolio is measured by interest rate sensitivity (duration). In some cases interest rate derivatives are used in order to adjust the duration of individual currencies.
