In the first half of 2003, the net expense from financial items increased to NOK932 million from NOK71 million in the first half of 2002. The increase in net expense was principally due to losses on currency hedging of our net cash flow in the first half of 2003, while in 2002 we had gains on our currency hedging. In general, we hedge between 50% to 100% of the currency exposure on our net operational cash flows on a rolling twelve-month basis.
