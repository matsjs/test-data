Raw materials and other purchased goods are valued at purchase cost according to the FIFO principle. Finished goods are valued at production cost, which includes raw materials, energy, direct wages and a share of indirect costs, including ordinary maintenance and depreciation. The net selling value at a future selling date will be used if that is lower.

Fixed assets and depreciation
Fixed assets are valued at historical cost. Acquisition cost for tangible assets having long term future economic benefits are capitalised and classified as assets in the balance sheet. Spare parts are capitalised with the asset to which they pertain. For major investments with a long production time, interest is capitalised as part of the acquisition cost. Expenditure to increase capacity or improve quality that represents a future increase in earnings is capitalised in the balance sheet. Maintenance costs are expensed as an operating cost.
Ordinary depreciation is calculated from the time the use of the tangible asset commences and is calculated on the basis of the economic life of the asset.
Norske Skog has implemented the preliminary Norwegian accounting standard on impairment of assets in 2002.
Research & development
Research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred and are classified as operating costs.
