The primary types of pulp we use for the production of publication paper are TMP, other types of mechanical pulp, recycled pulp and small amounts of chemical pulp. In 2002, we estimate that 65% of our European pulp requirements were met by internally produced TMP and other types of mechanical pulp, 30% by internally produced recycled pulp and 5% by chemical pulp purchased from third parties.
