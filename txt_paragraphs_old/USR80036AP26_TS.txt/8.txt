Our business operates primarily in four geographic regions:
 South America with two wholly-owned paper mills in Chile and Brazil.
 Australasia with three wholly-owned paper mills in Australia and New Zealand.
 Asia with our 50% interest in PanAsia Paper Company (''PanAsia''), which currently has four paper mills in China, Korea and Thailand. PanAsia expects to complete construction of a second paper mill in China by 2005. We also have a 33.65% interest in Malaysian Newsprint Industries, a Malaysian newsprint producer operating one paper mill.
In addition, we have a significant minority stake of 30.6% in NorskeCanada, which has operations in North America comprising four publication paper mills in Canada (two of which also produce pulp).
We have created a corporate management area that we call ''Partially Owned Companies'' with operational responsibility for our interests in PanAsia, NorskeCanada, and Malaysian Newsprint Industries.
