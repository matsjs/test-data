Taxation for the first half of 2003 was NOK449 million compared to NOK311 million in the first half of 2003. As a percentage of operating earnings before tax, taxation was 81.6% in the first half of 2003. Taxation increased in the first half of 2003 primarily due to a natural resources tax on the sale of our power plants in Norway.
Net earnings were NOK100 million in the first half of 2003 compared to NOK606 million in the first half of 2002. Earnings per share after tax were NOK0.76 for the first half of 2003 compared to NOK4.58 for the first half of 2002. The consolidated return on capital employed was approximately 3.5% on an annualized basis in the first half of 2003 compared to approximately 5.5% on an annualized basis in the first half of 2002.

Changes in Our Structure in 2002 and 2001
When comparing results from 2002 and 2001 it is important to note several changes to our organizational structure which occurred during this time. Most significantly, our consolidated results for the first eight months of 2001 include the results of NorskeCanada, as we owned 50.8% of it up to this time. In August 2001, as a result of its acquisition of Pacifica Papers, a share issuance by NorskeCanada reduced our ownership interest to 36.1%, and the results of NorskeCanada have thereafter no longer been consolidated, but instead have been accounted for on an equity basis. In May 2002, an additional share issuance by NorskeCanada further reduced our interest from 36.1% to 30.6%. In addition, in August 2001 we increased our ownership interest in PanAsia by 16.7% from 33.3% to 50% and at the end of November 2001,

we acquired the Parenco and Walsum mills in Europe, following the sale of the Tasman Pulp mill in New Zealand in April 2001.
Operating Revenue
Operating revenue in 2002 decreased by 22.7% to NOK23,471 million from NOK30,354 million in 2001. The decrease in overall operating revenue is primarily attributable to the deconsolida tion of NorskeCanada in August 2001, a general strengthening of the Norwegian kroner and weak market conditions for publication paper products.
