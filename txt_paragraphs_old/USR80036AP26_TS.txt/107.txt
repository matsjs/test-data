Earnings Before Taxation
Taxation
Taxation for 2002 was a net gain of NOK362 million, due to a change in Australian tax rules and a revaluation of our tax position related to acquisitions in 2002, compared to a net tax expense of NOK1,234 million in 2001. As a percent of ordinary earnings before tax, the gain from taxation income was 45% in 2002.
Net Earnings
Net earnings (after deduction of the minority's share) were NOK1,162 million in 2002, a 53.4% decrease from net earnings of NOK2,494 million in 2001. Earnings per share after tax were NOK8.79 in 2002 compared to NOK20.68 in 2001. Our return on capital employed was 4.7% in 2002 compared to 13.7% in 2001.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
To date, we have generally funded capital expenditures through a combination of cash flow, capital increases and debt. Historically, we have generated cash flow primarily through our operations. Net cash flow from operations amounted to NOK1,088 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003, and NOK3,687 million in 2002 compared to NOK7,052 million in 2001. We have credit facilities (primarily denominated in euros and U.S. dollars) to fund capital expenditures and for working capital purposes.
Our total capital investment during the first half of 2003 was NOK438 million or approxi mately 27.0% of depreciation. Our total capital investment during 2002 was NOK1,146 million or approximately 37.7% of depreciation compared to 47.7% in 2001. We intend to maintain a capital expenditure to depreciation ratio of approximately 50% to 70% in the longer term. Capital expenditure for these purposes includes current investments in maintenance and the upgrading of paper machines but excludes any strategic investments (including new paper machines) which we may make in the future.
