We have given research and development a high priority in recent years. As part of the Improvement 2003 process our research and development group in Australasia was merged with our research and development group in Europe. We have increased staffing in our research and development group, particularly with people having production experience. Our research and development group now consists of approximately 60 employees. We have groups of research experts at ten of our paper mills and at our headquarters in Oslo. The research and development activities have been organized to optimize cooperation with production personnel and to be in close proximity to the operations of our mills.

Ownership of Partially Owned Companies
Our Partially Owned Companies corporate management entity is comprised of our 50% interest in PanAsia, our 30.6% interest in NorskeCanada, and our 33.65% interest in Malaysia Newsprint Industries.
PanAsia
PanAsia was formed in February 1999 as a joint venture between us, Abitibi-Consolidated of Canada and Hansol Paper of Korea. Each of the joint venture partners had a one-third interest in PanAsia. In August 2001, Hansol Paper sold its entire one-third stake in PanAsia to us and Abitibi-Consolidated. As a result, we and Abitibi-Consolidated currently each own 50% of PanAsia. For accounting purposes we historically consolidated one-third of PanAsia's financial results. Following our acquisition of an additional one-sixth interest in PanAsia, we have consolidated 50% of PanAsia's financial results.
Under our joint venture agreement, we have no ongoing financial commitments to PanAsia. PanAsia has an independent board of directors, on which we have three of the six seats.
The PanAsia joint venture partners are party to a shareholders agreement which provides that if any joint venture partner makes an acquisition of a business that produces publication papers within the ''Market Area'' of PanAsia (as defined in the shareholders agreement), PanAsia has the right to acquire these assets. The Market Area generally includes the AsiaPacific region and the Indian subcontinent, but does not include Australia or New Zealand. Our interest in Malaysian Newsprint Industries is affected by this provision. PanAsia has an ongoing right to purchase our shares in Malaysian Newsprint Industries at an agreed price.
