Both U.S. GAAP and Norwegian GAAP differentiate between operating and capital leases. Under U.S. GAAP, leases are capitalized if they meet any one of the four very specific criteria of SFAS No. 13 ''Accounting for Leases''. The same general criteria are applied under Norwegian GAAP, but the substance of the lease agreement will determine the accounting practice applied. Further differences between U.S. GAAP and Norwegian GAAP may occur regarding sale and leaseback transactions.
Inventories
Under U.S. GAAP, the acceptable methods of costing inventory are FIFO, LIFO, weighted moving average and specific identification. Inventory valuation must be recognized at the lower-of-cost-or-market value where market is generally defined as net realizable value. Under Norwegian GAAP, inventory values are measured at the lower of historic cost or fair market value based on the FIFO method. LIFO is not allowed under Norwegian GAAP.
Pensions
Under U.S. GAAP, the determination of pension costs for defined benefit pension plans is made pursuant to SFAS No. 87 ''Employers Accounting for Pensions''. Under Norwegian GAAP, the accounting standard for retirement benefit costs has to be applied. Both U.S. GAAP and Norwegian GAAP require the recognition of the net pension benefit obligation, although U.S. GAAP and Norwegian GAAP differ significantly in relation to matters such as actuarial assumptions and the treatment of actuarial gains.
Dividends
Under U.S. GAAP, dividends are not recognized as liabilities until declared. Under Norwegian GAAP, proposed dividends are usually recognized as liabilities. Under the Norwegian Companies Act, dividends are payable out of annual and retained earnings. The amount of dividends is subject to approval by the shareholders at a general meeting, following the fiscal year to which the dividends relate.
