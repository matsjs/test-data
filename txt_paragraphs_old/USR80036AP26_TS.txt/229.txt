Research and Development Costs
U.S. GAAP requires the immediate expense recognition of all research and development costs. Specific exceptions apply related to the development of computer software costs. Norwegian GAAP allows research and development costs that comply with certain criteria to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life; however, immediate expense recognition is common.
Revaluation of Fixed Assets
Under both Norwegian GAAP and U.S. GAAP, a revaluation of fixed assets is not permitted. Until 1998, revaluation was permitted under Norwegian GAAP. Our financial statements have not been restated for the effect, if any, of revaluations of previous years.
Capitalizing of Borrowing Costs
Under Norwegian GAAP and U.S. GAAP, borrowing costs related to the construction of certain assets should be capitalized. However, the borrowing costs include exchange rate differences from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs according to Norwegian GAAP, but not under U.S. GAAP.
