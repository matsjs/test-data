To date, we have generally funded capital expenditures through a combination of cash flow, capital increases and debt. Historically, we have generated cash flow primarily through our operations. Net cash flow from operations amounted to NOK1,088 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003, and NOK3,687 million in 2002 compared to NOK7,052 million in 2001. We have credit facilities (primarily denominated in euros and U.S. dollars) to fund capital expenditures and for working capital purposes.
Our most significant capital expenditures since January 1, 2003 have been the upgrading of an existing mill at Bruck in Austria for NOK260 million and the upgrading of a machine at Saugbrugs in Norway for NOK90 million.
We believe that, based on our current expectations regarding our results of operations and cash flow, our ability to borrow in the Norwegian and international capital markets and the expected proceeds of this offering, we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet all of our current and planned capital expenditures.
We issued shares in 1999 in connection with the merger of Union into us, in the first half of 2000 to finance the Fletcher Challenge Paper acquisition and in June 2001 to finance our acquisitions of an additional one-sixth interest in PanAsia and the Walsum and Parenco paper mills. At the end of June 30, 2003, our shareholders' equity was NOK19,646 million, including minority interests of NOK164 million, resulting in a shareholders' equity to assets ratio of 0.41.
We use the surplus cash flow generated by our operations mostly to repay loans. At June 30, 2003, we had assets of NOK47,513 million and consolidated interest-bearing liabilities of NOK20,017 million. As at June 30, 2003, our one-half portion of PanAsia's debt accounted for approximately 6.9% of our total debt. Our equity capital excluding minority interests increased by NOK1,718 million from NOK17,764 million at December 31, 2002 to NOK19,482 million at June 30, 2003 primarily due to exchange rate effects and to our sale of power generating assets during the first half of 2003. The increase in equity capital had a positive effect on our gearing ratio. Our gearing ratio (that is, the ratio of our net interest-bearing liabilities to shareholders' equity excluding minority interests) at the end of the first half of 2003 was 0.98 compared to 1.02 at the end of 2002. This represents an improvement of approximately 3.9%. Our target gearing ratio is 1.0 or less over a business cycle.
As a part of our long-term financing arrangements, we have several syndicated revolving credit facilities and term loan facilities. Among these are a syndicated 400 million multicurrency revolving credit facility with 96 million maturing in 2007 and 304 million maturing in 2009, and a syndicated U.S.$450 million multicurrency revolving credit facility with final maturity in 2005 and a syndicated loan facility of U.S.$90 million maturing in 2007. Several Nordic and international banks are participants in the facilities.
We have also established bilateral facilities totaling the equivalent of U.S.$210 million with three banks in Australasia and bilateral facilities totaling U.S.$90 million with three regional
34
banks in Chile. These facilities mature in three to four years. All these facilities permit drawings in a number of currencies. We have two syndicated term loans, one of which is a U.S.$187 million loan which matures in 2007 and the other of which is a 340 million loan which matures in 2009. In addition, we have several bilateral loans with Nordic Investment Bank maturing between 2005 to 2011. In addition, we have several additional small loan and credit facilities.
