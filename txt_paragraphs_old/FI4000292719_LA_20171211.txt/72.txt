The Common Transaction Security are shared among the Secured Parties. All the Secured Obligations secured by the Common Transaction Security shall rank in right and priority of payment and the Common Transaction Security shall secure the Secured Obligations, pari passu and pro rata without preference between them, except for liabilities owed to the Security Agent and certain costs incurred by the certain creditor representatives (including the Noteholders' Agent) which have priority to enforcement proceeds relating to Common Transaction Security in accordance with Clause 13 (Distribution o fProceeds).
Release of Common Transaction Security upon Non-Distressed Disposals
If a disposal of an asset subject to Common Transaction Security is a Non-Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised (at the request and cost of the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Secured Creditor or the Issuer) but subject to Clause 9.2.2 below:
(a) to release the Common Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a Secured Debt Document) over that asset; and
(b) to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the Common Transaction Security or any claim described in paragraph (i) above and issue any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable,
provided that the release of such Common Transaction Security is effected simultaneously with respect to all the Secured Obligations.
Each release of Common Transaction Security described in Clause 9.2.1 above shall become effective only on the making of the relevant Non-Distressed Disposal.
As long as no Distress Event has occurred, if any Disposal Proceeds are required to be applied in mandatory prepayment of any Financial Indebtedness under any Secured Obligation or, where no mandatory prepayment obligation applies (or does not cover all such proceeds), the Issuer otherwise wishes to prepay any of its Financial Indebtedness under any Secured Obligation and such prepayment is permitted under the Secured Debt Documents, then those Disposal Proceeds shall be released by the Security Agent from the Disposal Proceeds Account to the relevant Creditor Representatives to be applied in accordance with the relevant Secured Debt Documents and the consent of any other Party shall not be required for that application. Any surplus after such release can be released to the Issuer to be applied towards general corporate purposes of the Group subject to the Secured Debt Documents and no further consent is required from a Secured Creditor. In the event that the Issuer wishes to apply any such Disposal Proceeds towards prepayment of any Notes Liabilities (and is not prohibited from doing so under any other Secured Debt Documents), Clause 11.4 (Disposals) of these Terms and Conditions shall apply.
