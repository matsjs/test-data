19. Appointment and Replacement of the Agents
19.1.1 By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder, and, by acquiring Notes, each subsequent Noteholder:
(a) agrees to and accepts the appointment of the Noteholders' Agent to act as its agent and representative under the Act on Noteholders' Agent in all matters relating to the Notes and the Notes Documents (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under the Intercreditor Agreement), and authorises the Noteholders Agent to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent, unless such consent is specifically required by these Terms and Conditions) in all matters set out in the Act on Noteholders' Agent and particularly in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Notes held by such Noteholder (including any legal or arbitration proceeding relating to the enforcement of the Common Transaction Security (to the extent included in the role of the Noteholders' Agent)) and to exercise such rights, powers, authorities and discretions as are specifically delegated to the Noteholders' Agent by the Act on Noteholders' Agent, these Terms and Conditions or the Intercreditor Agreement together with all such rights, powers, authorities and discretions as are incidental thereto; and
(b) agrees and accepts that the Noteholders' Agent shall have the rights, protections and benefits of the Intercreditor Agreement.
19.1.2
Each Noteholder shall immediately upon request provide the Noteholders' Agent with any such documents (in form and substance satisfactory to the Noteholders' Agent) that the Noteholders' Agent deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Notes Documents. The Noteholders' Agent is under no obligation to represent a Noteholder which does not comply with such request if due to such failure the Noteholders' Agent is unable to represent such Noteholder.
19.1.3 The Issuer shall promptly upon request provide the Noteholders' Agent with any documents and other assistance (in form and substance satisfactory to the Noteholders' Agent), that the Noteholders' Agent deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Notes Documents.
19.1.4
The Noteholders' Agent is entitled to fees for its work and to be indemnified for costs, losses and liabilities on the terms set out in the Notes Documents and the Agency Agreement and the Noteholders' Agent's obligations as Noteholders' Agent under the Notes Documents are conditioned upon the due payment of such fees and indemnifications.
