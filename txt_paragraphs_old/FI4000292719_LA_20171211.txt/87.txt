Each Noteholder agrees, with respect to the Notes it holds, not to exercise, and hereby waives in advance, its right in accordance with the Finnish Companies Act to object to any merger or demerger if (and only if) such merger or demerger (as applicable) (a) is not prohibited under these Terms and Conditions or (b) has been consented to by the Noteholders in a Noteholders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure. In the event that any Noteholder has opposed a merger or a demerger that has later been consented to by the Noteholders in a Noteholders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure, each such Noteholder is obliged to promptly withdraw any notice of opposing the merger or demerger. Further, without prejudice to the Noteholders' primary obligation to withdraw any notices opposing the merger or demerger, the Noteholders have by these Terms and Conditions irrevocably authorised the Issuer to represent them with respect to the Finnish Trade Register in order to withdraw the notices opposing the merger or demerger that has been consented to by the Noteholders in a Noteholders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure.
