This includes, but is not limited to, any amendment to, or waiver of, the terms of any Notes Document that does not require a higher majority (other than an amendment or waiver permitted pursuant to Clause 18.1(a), (b), (d), (e), (f) or (g) which does not require any further consent of the Noteholders) or an acceleration of the Notes or the exercise of the rights of the Noteholders to enforce any Common Transaction Security.

(b) if in respect of a Written Procedure, reply to the request.
15.8 If a quorum does not exist at a Noteholders' Meeting or in respect of a Written Procedure, the Noteholders' Agent or the Issuer shall convene a second Noteholders' Meeting (in accordance with Clause 16.1) or initiate a second Written Procedure (in accordance with Clause 17.1), as the case may be, provided that the relevant proposal has not been withdrawn by the person(s) who initiated the procedure for Noteholders' consent. The quorum requirement in Clause 15.7 shall not apply to such second Noteholders' Meeting or Written Procedure.
15.9 Any decision which extends or increases the obligations of the Issuer or the Noteholders' Agent, or limits, reduces or extinguishes the rights or benefits of the Issuer or the Noteholders' Agent, under the Notes Documents shall be subject to the Issuer's or the Noteholders' Agent's consent, as applicable.
15.10
The Issuer may not, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Noteholder for or as inducement to any consent under these Terms and Conditions, unless such consideration is offered to all Noteholders that consent at the relevant Noteholders' Meeting or in a Written Procedure within the time period stipulated for the consideration to be payable or the time period for replies in the Written Procedure, as the case may be.
15.11 A matter decided at a duly convened and held Noteholders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure is binding on all Noteholders, irrespective of them being present or represented at the Noteholders' Meeting or responding in the Written Procedure.
15.12 All costs and expenses incurred by the Issuer or the Noteholders' Agent for the purpose of convening a Noteholders' Meeting or for the purpose of carrying out a Written Procedure, including reasonable fees to the Noteholders' Agent, shall be paid by the Issuer.
