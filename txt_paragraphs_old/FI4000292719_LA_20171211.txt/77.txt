(iii) in case of any instruction by a Credit Facility Agent, a Credit Facility Acceleration Event has occurred and:
(A) that Credit Facility Agent has delivered to each other Creditor Representative and the Security Agent a copy of an Acceleration Notice by that Credit Facility Agent to the Issuer concerning such Credit Facility Acceleration Event; and
(B) the Credit Facility Standstill Period has expired and at the end of the Credit Facility Standstill Period, the Credit Facility Event of Default giving rise to that Credit Facility Acceleration Event is continuing,
the Creditor Representative representing the Noteholders, the Pari Passu Noteholders or the Credit Facility Lenders on behalf of which such Acceleration Notice has been delivered, may deliver Enforcement Instructions (a "Secondary Enforcement Notice") to the Security Agent and the Security Agent shall promptly forward such Secondary Enforcement Notice to each Creditor Representative and each Hedge Counterparty which did not deliver such Secondary Enforcement Notice and the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Common Transaction Security which such Creditor Representative (acting upon the instructions of the requisite majority of Noteholders, Pari Passu Noteholders or Credit Facility Lenders determined in accordance with relevant Secured Debt Document in respect of which it is the Creditor Representative), is then entitled to give to the Security Agent under this Clause 9.5.5.
In the event that the Security Agent receives Secondary Enforcement Notices from several Creditor Representatives under this Clause 9.5.5, it shall act in accordance with the Secondary Enforcement Notice delivered first or, if several Secondary Enforcement Notices are delivered simultaneously, in accordance with the Secondary Enforcement Notices delivered by the Creditor Representative(s) representing the Majority Noteholders and the Creditor Representative(s) representing the Majority Credit Facility Lenders, as applicable.
The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Common Transaction Security or taking any other action as to Enforcement unless instructed otherwise by:
(a) the Instructing Group; or
(b) to the extent permitted to require the enforcement of the Common Transaction Security under Clause 9.5.5, the Noteholders, the Pari Passu Noteholders or the Credit Facility Lenders, as applicable, on behalf of which the Secondary Enforcement Notice has been delivered.
