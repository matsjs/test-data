(b) By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Bondholder agrees, and by acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Bondholder confirms, (i) that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and (ii) agrees to be bound by these Terms and Conditions and the other Finance Documents.
(d) The minimum permissible investment upon issuance of the Bonds (including with respect to any Subsequent Bonds) is EUR 100,000.
(e) Provided that the Incurrence Test is met, the Issuer may, on one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Bonds. Subsequent Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate, the nominal amount and the final maturity applicable to the Initial Bonds shall apply to Subsequent Bonds. The price of the Subsequent Bonds may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal Amount. The maximum total nominal amount of the Bonds (the Initial Bonds and all Subsequent Bonds) may not exceed EUR 6,000,000 unless a consent from the Bondholders is obtained in accordance with paragraph (e)(i) of Clause 19 (Decisions of Bondholders). Each Subsequent Bond shall entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with paragraph (a) of Clause 9, and otherwise have the
same rights as the Initial Bonds.
(f)
Except as set out in Clause 5 (Transfer restrictions) below, and subject to any
restrictions to which a Bondholder may be subject due to local law or otherwise,
the Bonds are freely transferable. Each Bondholder must ensure compliance
with local laws and regulations applicable at their own cost and expense.
