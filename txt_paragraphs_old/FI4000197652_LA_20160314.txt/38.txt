10. Commitment Fee
(b) For the avoidance of doubt:
(i)
if the Transaction Lapse Event does not occur, the Bondholders will
receive the Interest accrued during the period for which the
Commitment Fee would have accrued; and
(ii)
if the Transaction Lapse Event occurs, the Bondholders will receive the
Commitment Fee but no Interest.
