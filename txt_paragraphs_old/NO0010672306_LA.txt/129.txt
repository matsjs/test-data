14.4 The Obligors are responsible for withholding any withholding tax imposed by applicable law on any payments to the Bondholders. If the Obligors are required by law to withhold any withholding tax from any payment under any Finance Document:
(a) the amount of the payment due from the Obligors shall be increased to such amount which is necessary to ensure that the Bondholders receive a net amount which is (after making the required withholding) equal to the payment which would have been due if no withholding had been required; and
(b) the Obligors shall at the request of the Bond Trustee deliver to the Bond Trustee evidence that the required tax reduction or withholding has been made.
14.5 If any withholding tax is imposed due to subsequent changes in applicable law after the date of this Bond Loan Agreement, the Obligors shall have the right to call all but not some of the Bonds (including all Additional Bonds) at par (100% of the principal face amount) plus all Profit. Such call shall be notified by the Obligors in writing to the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders at least 30 Banking Days prior to the settlement date of the call.
