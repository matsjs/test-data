16.3 Resolutions passed at Bondholders' M eetings.
(a) At the Bondholders' Meeting each Bondholder may cast one vote for each Voting Bond of the relevant Issue owned at close of business on the day prior to the date of the Bondholders' Meeting in accordance with the records registered in the Securities Depository. Whoever opens the Bondholders' Meeting shall adjudicate any question concerning which Bonds shall count as Issuers' Bonds. Issuers' Bonds shall not have any voting rights. For this purpose, a Bondholder that has a Bond that is nominee registered shall be deemed as the Bondholder of such Bond (instead of the nominee) provided that the Bondholder presents relevant evidence stating that the relevant Bondholder is the Bondholder of the Bond and the amount of Bonds held by such Bondholder.

(c) In order to form a quorum, at least half (1/2) of the Voting Bonds of the relevant Issue or of the face value of all Outstanding Bonds under this Bond Loan Agreement, as applicable, must be represented at the meeting, subject to Clause 16.4. If less than half (1/2) of the Voting Bonds of the relevant Issue or of the face value of all Outstanding Bonds under this Bond Loan Agreement, as applicable, are represented, the Bondholders' Meeting shall be held and voting completed, but such voting shall be solely for purposes of specifying the result thereof in the summons for any repeated Bondholders' Meeting as set forth in Clause 16.4(a).
(d) Resolutions shall be passed by simple majority of the Voting Bonds of the relevant Issue or of the face value of all Outstanding Bonds, as applicable, represented at the Bondholders' Meeting, unless otherwise set forth in Clause 16.3(e).
