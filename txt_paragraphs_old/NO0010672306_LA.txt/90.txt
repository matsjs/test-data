2.9 Additional Tranche B2 Bonds. Cecon 2 has resolved to issue Additional Tranche B2 Bonds to the Bondholders holding Tranche B2 Bonds on each April 1 and October 1 occurring prior to the Tranche B2 Trigger Date, in order to increase the principal amount of the Tranche B2 Bonds by an amount equal to the accrued interest on the then outstanding Tranche B2 Bonds since the Tranche B2 Issue Date or the previous April 1 or October 1, as the case may be, as further set out in Clause 9.5. Each Additional Tranche B2 Bond shall have the same terms and rights as the original Tranche B2 Bonds issued on the Tranche B2 Issue Date and shall be deemed to constitute a part of such Issue, in each case, from the date such Additional Tranche B2 Bond is registered in the Securities Depository. For the avoidance of doubt, any issuance of Additional Tranche B2 Bonds will be carried out without any further issuance of Warrants.
