(f) within a reasonable time limit provide information about the Borrower's financial condition as the Loan Trustee may reasonably request,
(h) immediately notify the Bondholders (via Securities Depository), the Trustee and the Exchange (if listed) if a Change of Control Event, or a mandatory redemption according to Clause 10.4 takes place.
13.2 During the term of the Loan, the Borrower shall, and shall procure that none of the Subsidiaries shall, (unless the Loan Trustee or the Bondholders' meeting (as the case may be) in writing has agreed to otherwise) comply with the following general covenants:
(a) not cease to carry on its business,
(b) not;
(i) sell or dispose of all or a substantial part of its assets or operations, (ii) change the nature of its business, or (iii) merge, demerge or in any other way restructure its business,
in a manner which might jeopardise the Borrower's fulfilment of its obligations under the Loan Agreement.
Notwithstanding the aforesaid, it is understood that the Borrower is allowed to sell or dispose of, without approval of the Loan Trustee or a Bondholders' meeting, construction contracts that are not related to the Vessels, or any vessels or other assets not included in the Loan Security unless such sale will be considered as an Event of Default.
(c) not agree to any material changes to the Construction Contracts which, in the reasonable opinion of the Loan Trustee, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Borrower's ability to perform its obligations under the Loan Agreement (any agreement for changes leading to a delay of the Delivery Date by more than 3 months is in any event to be considered as a material change which will require the approval of the Bondholders' meeting),
