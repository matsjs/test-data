Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve (12) months
elapsed (30/360-days basis).
10.4
If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it under the Finance Documents on its due
date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from, but excluding, the due date
up to and including the date of actual payment at a rate which is 200 basis points higher than
the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall
accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Agent or the CSD, in which
case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
