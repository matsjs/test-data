(b) secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of accrued but unpaid Interest (Interest due on an earlier Interest Payment Date to be paid before any Interest due on a later Interest Payment Date);
(d) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under the Finance Documents.
Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with items (a) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer or the Guarantors (as applicable). The application of proceeds in accordance with items (a) to (d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal.
If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in Clause 14.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way of a corresponding distribution in accordance with Clause 14.1.
If the Issuer or the Agent shall make any payment under this Clause 14, the Issuer or the Agent, as applicable, shall notify the Holders of any such payment at least fifteen (15) Business Days before the payment is made. Such notice shall specify the Record Date, the payment date and the amount to be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any Interest due but unpaid the Record Date specified in Clause 9.1 shall apply.
