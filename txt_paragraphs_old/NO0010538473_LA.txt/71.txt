(a) For the purpose of ensuring and preserving the validity and continuity of the security rights granted and to be granted by the Issuer under or pursuant to the Finance Documents the Issuer hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes, as an abstract obligation (abstraktes Schuldversprechen), to pay to the Security Agent amounts equal to and in the currency of the obligations and liabilities ("Obligations") from time to time due in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Finance Documents and irrespective of any discharge of an Obligor's obligation to pay such amounts resulting from a failure by a Secured Party to take appropriate steps in insolvency proceedings affecting an Obligor to preserve their respective right to be paid those amounts (such payment undertaking and the obligations and liabilities which are the result thereof the "Parallel Covenant").
