In case of any changes being introduced to GAAP after the date of the Bond Agreement, the Issuer and the Trustee shall jointly conduct a review of the impact of such changes for the Issuer (including, without limitations, whether such changes would have any impact on the financial covenants), and, if relevant, the parties shall enter into such amendments to the Bond Agreement as may be required to arrive at and apply under the New GAAP the same financial covenants as set forth in this Clause 13.4.

(if applicable), and the registration and administration of the Bonds in the Securities Register.
14.2 The costs, expenses and fees payable to the Bond Trustee (on behalf of itself) shall be paid by the Issuer and arc set forth in a separate agreement between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee (on behalf of itself). Fees and expenses payable to the Bond Trustee (on behalf of itself) which, due to the Issuer's insolvency or similar circumstances, are not reimbursed in any other way may be covered by making an equivalent reduction in the payments to the Bondholders. For the avoidance of doubt, this Clause 14.2 also applies for any costs incurred by the Bond Trustee in connection with enforcement of the Bond Issue.
14.3 The Issuer shall cover all public fees in connection with the Bonds and the Finance Documents. Any public fees levied on the trade of Bonds in the secondary market shall be paid by the Bondholders, unless otherwise provided by law or regulation, and the Issuer is not responsible for reimbursing any such fees.
14.4 The Issuer is responsible for withholding any withholding tax imposed by applicable law on any payments to the Bondholders. If any withholding tax is imposed, the Issuer shall grossup all payments to the Bond Trustee.
