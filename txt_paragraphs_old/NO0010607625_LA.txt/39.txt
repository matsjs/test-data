provided, however, that no cross-guarantees may be given by a Subsidiary being an obligor under the Senior Debt Facilities in respect of the UDW Units as security for the Senior Debt Facilities raised in respect of the New UDW Units which will result in the Cap (as defined under Clause 13.3(m) (Senior Debt Facilities restriction) below) being exceeded.
The total amount of Senior Debt Facilities which is secured against the New UDW Units shall not be limited.
For the avoidance of doubt, if any cross-collateralization (including, but not limited to, any recourse against or guarantees from any direct or indirect Subsidiary owning the UDW Units or any of its assets or earnings) is granted in respect of the UDW Units, such cross-collateralization shall always be limited to the Cap.
(n) Credit rating The Issuer shall ensure that it gets a credit rating on both itself (short and long term credit rating) and the Bond Issue by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's before the Interest Payment Date in April 2012. However, if such ratings are not in place and published before the Interest Payment Date in October 2011, the Fixed Rate shall be increased with 0.25 percentage points per annum (i.e. from 9.50 per cent per annum to 9.75 per cent per annum) from and including the Interest Payment Date in October 201.1 and to, but not including, the Interest Payment Date immediately following the date where the Issuer has obtained the necessary ratings as set out above.
