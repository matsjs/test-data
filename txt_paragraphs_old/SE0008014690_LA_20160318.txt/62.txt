The Trustee shall in such case, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that the cause for termination has ceased.

If the Holders, without any prior initiative to decision from the Trustee or the Issuer, have made a decision regarding termination in accordance with Clause 14 (Decisions by Holders), the Trustee shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated.
