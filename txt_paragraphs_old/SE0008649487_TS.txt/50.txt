19.4 Swiss Parallel Debt
(a) Each debtor of Secured Obligations and each Secured Party (other than the Agent) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees and undertakes with the Agent (and, where applicable, by way of an abstract acknowledgement of debt (abstraktes Schuldanerkenntnis)) that each debtor of Secured Obligations shall pay to the Agent sums equal to, and in the currency of, any sums owing by it to a Secured Party (other than the Agent) under any Finance Documents (the "Principal Obligations") as and when the same fall due for payment under the relevant Finance Document (together with the obligations described in paragraph (e) below, the "Swiss Parallel Debt").
(b) Each debtor of Secured Obligations and each Secured Party (other than the Agent) acknowledges that the right of the Agent to demand payment of the Swiss Parallel Debt shall be independent and several from the rights of the other Secured Parties to demand payment of the Principal Obligations provided that the payment by a debtor of its Swiss Parallel Debt to the Agent in accordance with this Clause 19.4 shall also discharge (in the amount of the relevant payment) the corresponding Principal Obligations and vice versa, the payment by a debtor of its Principal Obligations in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Finance Document shall also discharge (in the amount of the relevant payment) the corresponding Swiss Parallel Debt but further provided that no Principal Obligation shall be discharged by a discharge of the Swiss Parallel Debt if such discharge of the Swiss Parallel Debt is effected by virtue of any set-off, counterclaim or similar defence invoked by a debtor of Secured Obligations vis-a-vis the Agent.
(c) Despite the foregoing, any payment in relation to Secured Obligations under a Finance Document shall be made to the Agent unless expressly stated otherwise in these Terms and Conditions or in that Finance Document or unless the Agent directs such payment to be made otherwise than to the Agent.
32
(d) Without limiting or affecting the Agent's rights against any debtor (whether under this Clause 19.4 or under any other provision of the Finance Documents), the Agent agrees with each other Secured Party (on a several and divided basis) that it will not exercise its rights under the Swiss Parallel Debt in respect of the Principal Obligations owing to a Secured Party other than as provided for herein or in any of the Finance Documents. However, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the previous sentence shall in any way limit the Agent's right to act in the protection or preservation of rights under any Security Document or to enforce any Transaction Security as contemplated by these Terms and Conditions, the relevant Security Document or any other Finance Documents (or to do any act reasonably incidental to the foregoing).
(e) For the purpose of this Clause 19.4, the Agent acts in its own name and not as a trustee, and its claims in respect of the Swiss Parallel Debt shall not be held on trust. The Transaction Security granted under the Swiss Security Documents to the Agent to secure the Swiss Parallel Debt is granted to the Agent in its capacity as creditor of the Swiss Parallel Debt and shall not be held on trust.
