If the Bond Trustee, in breach of these Terms and Conditions, has not convened a Holders' Meeting within 30 Banking Days after having received such notice, the requesting person may convene the Holders' Meeting itself. If the requesting person is a Holder, the Issuer shall upon request from such Holder provide the Holder with necessary information from the register kept by the CSD and, if no person to open the Holders' Meeting has been appointed by the Bond Trustee, the meeting shall be opened by a person appointed by the requesting person.

Issuer and the Issuer's auditors may attend the Holders' Meeting. The Holders' Meeting may decide that further individuals may attend. If a representative/proxy shall attend the Holders' Meeting instead of the Holder, the representative/proxy shall present a duly executed proxy or other document establishing its authority to represent the Holder.
Without amending or varying these Terms and Conditions, the Bond Trustee may prescribe such further regulations regarding the convening and holding of a Holders' Meeting as the Bond Trustee may deem appropriate. Such regulations may include a possibility for Holders to vote without attending the meeting in person.

The Bond Trustee shall instigate a Written Procedure no later than 5 Banking Days after receipt of a request from the Issuer or the Holder(s) (or such later date as may be necessary for technical or administrative reasons) by sending a communication to each such person who is registered as a Holder on the Record Date prior to the date on which the communication is sent.
