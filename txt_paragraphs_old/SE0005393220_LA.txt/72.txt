DECISIONS BY HOLDERS
A request by the Bond Trustee for a decision by the Holders on a matter relating to the Finance Documents shall (at the option of the Bond Trustee) be dealt with at a Holders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure.
Any request from the Issuer or a Holder (or Holders) representing at least 10 per cent, of the Adjusted Nominal Amount (such request may only be validly made by a person who is a Holder on the Banking Day immediately following the day on which the request is received by the Bond Trustee and shall, if made by several Holders, be made by them jointly) for a decision by the Holders on a matter relating to the Finance Documents shall be directed to the Bond Trustee and dealt with at a Holders' Meeting or by way a Written Procedure, as determined by the Bond Trustee. The person requesting the decision may suggest the form for decision making, but if it is in the Bond Trustee's opinion more appropriate that a matter is dealt with at a Holders' Meeting than by way of a Written Procedure, it shall be dealt with at a Holders' Meeting.
