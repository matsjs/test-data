21.4.8
A Holder (or Holders) representing at least 10 per cent, of the Adjusted Nominal Amount may, by notice to the Issuer (such notice may only be validly given by a person who is a Holder on the Banking Day immediately following the day on which the notice is received by the Issuer and shall, if given by several Holders, be given by them jointly), require that a Holders' Meeting is held for the purpose of dismissing the Bond Trustee and appointing a new Bond Trustee. The Issuer may, at a Holders' Meeting convened by it or by way of Written Procedure initiated by it, propose to the Holders that the Bond Trustee be dismissed and a new Bond Trustee appointed.
If the Holders have not appointed a successor Bond Trustee within 90 days after (i) the earlier of the notice of resignation was given or the resignation otherwise took place or (ii) the Bond Trustee was dismissed through a decision by the Holders, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Bond Trustee which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable company which regularly acts as bond trustee under debt issuances.
The retiring Bond Trustee shall, at its own cost, make available to the successor Bond Trustee such documents and records and provide such assistance as the successor Bond Trustee may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Bond Trustee under the Finance Documents.
The Bond Trustee's resignation or dismissal shall only take effect upon the appointment of a successor Bond Trustee and acceptance by such successor Bond Trustee of such appointment and the execution of all necessary documentation to effectively substitute the retiring Bond Trustee.
Upon the appointment of a successor, the retiring Bond Trustee shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the Finance Documents and remain liable under the Finance Documents in respect of any action which it took or failed to take whilst acting as Bond Trustee. Its successor, the Issuer and each of the Holders shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves under the Finance Documents as they would have had if such successor had been the original Bond Trustee.
In the event that there is a change of the Bond Trustee in accordance with this Clause 21.4, the Issuer shall execute such documents and take such actions as the new Bond Trustee may reasonably require for the purpose of vesting in such new Bond Trustee the rights, powers and obligation of the Bond Trustee and releasing the retiring Bond Trustee from its further obligations under the Finance Documents and the Agent Agreement. Unless the Issuer and the new Bond Trustee agrees otherwise, the new Bond Trustee shall be entitled to the same fees and the same indemnities as the retiring Bond Trustee.
