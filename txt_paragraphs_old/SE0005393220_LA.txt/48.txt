If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it under the Finance Documents on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from (but excluding) the due date up to (and including) the date of actual payment at a rate which is 2.00 percentage points higher than the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Bond Trustee or the CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
Redemption at maturity
The Issuer shall redeem all, but not only some, of the outstanding Bonds in full on the Final Redemption Date (or, to the extent such day is not a Banking Day, on the Banking Day following from an application of the Banking Day Convention) with an amount per Bond equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
The Group Companies' purchase of Bonds
Any Group Company may, subject to applicable law, at any time and at any price purchase Bonds. The Bonds held by a Group Company may at such Group Company's discretion be retained, sold or, if held by the Issuer, cancelled.
Early voluntary redemption by the Issuer (call option)
The Issuer may redeem all, but not only some, of the outstanding Bonds at any time prior to the First Call Date, at an amount equal to 100.00 per cent, of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest, plus the Applicable Premium.
The Issuer may redeem all, but not only some, of the outstanding Bonds in full on any Banking Day falling after the First Call Date but before the Final Redemption Date. The Bonds shall be redeemed at the Call Option Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
