FORCE MAJEURE AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
The Issuing Agent shall have no liability to the Holders if it has observed reasonable care. The Issuing Agent shall never be responsible for indirect damage with exception of gross negligence and wilful misconduct.
Should a Force Majeure Event arise which prevents the Bond Trustee/Security Agent or the Issuing Agent from taking any action required to comply with the Finance Documents, such action may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed.
The provisions in this Clause 26 apply unless they are inconsistent with the provisions of the Financial Instruments Accounts Act which provisions shall take precedence.
GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

Any dispute or claim arising in relation to these Terms and Conditions shall, subject to Clause 27.3, be determined by Swedish courts and the District Court of Stockholm shall be the court of first instance.
