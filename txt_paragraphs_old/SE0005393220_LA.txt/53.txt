Upon a permitted disposal of shares in Group Companies, or of all or substantially all of the Issuer's or another Group Company's assets, or operations, where the fair market value of such assets disposed of during any financial year exceeds in aggregate 5.00 per cent, of the Group EBITDA according to the latest Financial Report (the "Threshold"), the proceeds from such disposal (less reasonable costs incurred in connection with the disposal) in excess of the Threshold, shall within 12 months of the disposal either (A) be reinvested in the business of the Group or (B) used to repurchase Bonds on the market. If any proceeds from such disposal (less reasonable costs incurred in connection with the disposal) in excess of the Threshold, have not been used for reinvestments in the business of the Group and/or repurchases of Bonds over the market within 12 months of the disposal (the "Remaining

12.7 12.8 12.8.1
Amount"), the Issuer shall have the right and the obligation to repay the total Nominal Amount with an amount equal to such Remaining Amount. Any such repayment of the total Nominal Amount shall be made as partial repayments of all outstanding Bonds by way of reducing the Nominal Amount of each Bond pro rata. The repayment shall be made on the next possible Interest Payment Date after the 12 months period of the disposal, and the Issuer shall give not less than 20 Banking Days' notice of the repayment to the Bond Trustee and the Holders. The repayment per Bond shall equal the repaid percentage of the Nominal Amount (rounded down to the nearest EUR 100) plus (i) a premium on the repaid amount amounting to 5.00 per cent, of the Nominal Amount to be repaid, or such lower amount as is set forth in the Call Option Amount for the relevant period, and (ii) accrued but unpaid Interest on the repaid amount.
