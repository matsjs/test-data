obtain information directly from the debt register kept by the CSD in respect of the Bonds.
The Issuer may not revoke any such power of attorney unless directed by the Bond Trustee or unless consent thereto is given by the Holders.
At the request of the Bond Trustee, the Issuer shall promptly instruct the Issuing Agent to obtain information from the debt register kept by the CSD in respect of the Bonds and provide it to the Bond Trustee.
RIGHT TO ACT ON BEHALF OF A HOLDER
If any person other than a Holder wishes to exercise any rights under the Finance Documents, it must obtain a power of attorney (or, if applicable, a coherent chain of powers o f attorney), a certificate from the authorised nominee or other sufficient proof of authorisation for such person.
A Holder may issue one or several powers of attorney to third parties to represent it in relation to some or all of the Bonds held by it. Any such representative may act independently under the Finance Documents in relation to the Bonds for which such representative is entitled to represent the Holder and may further delegate its right to represent the Holder by way of a further power of attorney.
The Bond Trustee shall only have to examine the face of a power of attorney or other proof o f authorisation that has been provided to it pursuant to Clause 8.2 and may assume that it has been duly authorised, is valid, has not been revoked or superseded and that it is in full force and effect, unless otherwise is apparent from its face.
PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE BONDS
Any payment or repayment under the Finance Documents, or any amount due in respect of a repurchase of any Bonds, shall be made to such person who is registered as a Holder on the Record Date prior to the relevant due date, or to such other person who is registered with the CSD on such date as being entitled to receive the relevant payment, repayment or repurchase amount.
