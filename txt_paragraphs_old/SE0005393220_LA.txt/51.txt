Any Bonds repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to this Clause 11.6 may at the Issuer's discretion be retained, sold or cancelled.
So long as any Bond remains outstanding, the Issuer undertakes to comply with the special undertakings set forth in this Clause 12.
Distributions
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of its Subsidiaries, (i) pay any dividend on shares, (ii) repurchase any of its own shares, (iii) redeem its share capital or other restricted equity with repayment to shareholders, (iv) repay or pay interest under any shareholder loans, (v) grant any loans, or (vi) make any other similar distribution or transfers of value (Sw. värdeöverföringar) to the Issuer's, or the respective Subsidiary's, direct and indirect shareholders or the Affiliates of such direct and indirect shareholders (i)-(vi) above are together and individually referred to as a "Restricted Payment"), provided however that any such Restricted Payment can be made, if no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such Restricted Payment, by (i) the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries if such Restricted Payment is made to the Issuer or any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries and, if made by a Subsidiary which is not wholly-owned, is made on a pro rata basis (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the granting of the Intercompany Loans), (ii) the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries if such Restricted Payment consists of payment of interest or capital in relation to Existing Shareholder Loans and the Vendor Note and is made in immediate connection with the Bond Issue, (iii) the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries if such Restricted Payment consists of payment of interest or principal in relation to Shareholder Loans and such payment is financed through the issuance of equity securities or the raising of another Shareholder Loan, and (iv) the Issuer, if such Restricted Payment consists of a group contribution (Sw. koncernbidrag), provided that no cash or other funds are transferred from the Issuer as a result thereof (i.e., the group contributions are merely accounting measures) and provided that such distribution is subsequently converted into a shareholder's contribution to the Issuer as soon as practically possible.

Listing of Bonds
The Issuer shall ensure that the Bonds are listed at the corporate bond list on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, or if such admission to trading is not possible to obtain or maintain, admitted to trading on another Regulated Market, not later than 12 months after the Issue Date and shall take all measures required to ensure that the Bonds, once listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable), continue being listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) for as long as any Bond is outstanding (however, taking into account the rules and regulations of NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) and the CSD (as amended from time to time) preventing trading in the Bonds in close connection to the redemption of the Bonds). Upon any Subsequent Bond Issue, the Issuer shall promptly, but not later than 10 Banking Days after the relevant issue date, procure that the volume of Bonds listed is increased accordingly.
