B.2 The Conversion Right cannot be separated from the Bond.
B.4 In order to exercise a Conversion Right, the Bondholder shall deliver to the Paying Agent (via its Account Managers) a duly completed, irrevocable and signed exercise notice.
Request for conversion takes place by the Bondholder notifying his Account Managers of the number of Bonds which shall be converted. The Account Managers shall then promptly forward the request to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent shall carry the conversion into effect at the Conversion Date.
Conversion will be effected by a set-off o f the total nominal value of the Bonds to be converted against the issuing of the whole number of Shares resulting from dividing the total nominal value of the Bonds to be converted by the Conversion Price. Any excess amount beyond the whole number of Shares converted by the Bonds shall fall to the Issuer, unless the Conversion Date falls in an ex-period for a Payment Date and/or the Maturity Date, then interest due shall be paid to the relevant Bondholder.
Interest accrued since the latest Interest Payment Date but not due on a Conversion Date, shall not be paid in cash nor kind to the Bondholders, but shall accrue to the Issuer.
B.5 The Issuer is responsible for ensuring that:
(a) the share capital increase is registered in the company register as soon as possible,
(b) the Remaining Bonds is being written down within the Conversion Date, and
(c) Shares issued upon conversion are registered in the Securities Depository on the Conversion Date.
