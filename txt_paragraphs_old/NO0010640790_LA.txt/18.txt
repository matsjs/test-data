a) The first USD 7.3 million in Bonds (in net cash proceeds) shall be settled by delivery of the Bonds kept in escrow for the Bondholders in NEC04 and NEC05, on a pro rata basis, against payment of par value to these Bondholders.
c) The next USD 13.7 million (in net cash proceeds) shall be settled against delivery of the Bonds kept in escrow for the Bondholders in NEC02, on a pro rata basis, against payment of par value to these Bondholders,
