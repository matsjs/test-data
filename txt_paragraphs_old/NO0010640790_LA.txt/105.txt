C.12 If the Conversion Date in relation to the conversion of any Bond shall be after any consolidation or sub-division as is mentioned in clause C .l, or after the record date or other due date for the establishment of entitlement for any such issue, distribution, grant or offer (as the case may be) as is mentioned in clauses C.2, C.3, C.4, C.5 or C.9, or after any such issue or grant as is mentioned in clause C.6 and C.7, in any case in circumstances where the relevant Conversion Date falls before the relevant adjustment becomes effective under this clause C (such adjustment, a "Retroactive Adjustment"), then the Issuer shall (conditional upon the relevant adjustment becoming effective) procure that there shall be issued or delivered to the converting Bondholder, such additional number of Shares (if any) (the "Additional Shares") as, together with the Shares issued or to be issued or delivered on conversion of the relevant Bond (together with any fraction of a Share not so issued), is equal to the number of Shares which would have been required to be issued or delivered on conversion of such Bond if the relevant adjustment (more particularly referred to in the said provisions of this clause C) to the Conversion Price had in fact been made and become effective immediately prior to the relevant Conversion Date. Additional Shares will be delivered to Bondholders not later than 10 Banking Days following the date the relevant Retroactive Adjustment becomes effective (the "Reference Date").
C .l3 No adjustment will be made to the Conversion Price where Shares or other Securities (including rights, warrants and options) are issued, offered, exercised, allotted, appropriated, modified or granted to, or for the benefit of, employees or former employees (including Directors holding or formerly holding executive office or the personal service company of any such person) or their spouses or relatives, in each case, o f the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any associated company or to trustees to be held for the benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to any employees' share or option scheme.
C.l 4 On any adjustment, the resultant Conversion Price, if not an integral multiple of USD 0.001, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of USD 0.001. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price where such adjustment (rounded down if applicable) would be less than one per cent, of the Conversion Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any amount by which the Conversion Price has been rounded down, shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and such subsequent adjustment shall be made on the basis that the adjustment not required to be made had been made at the relevant time. Prior to the Reverse Share Split, any reference in this Clause C .l4 to "USD 0.001" should be read as "USD 0.0001".
Notice of any adjustments to the Conversion Price shall be given by the Issuer to Bondholders and the Loan Trustee promptly after the determination thereof.
