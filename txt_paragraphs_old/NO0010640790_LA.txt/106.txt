Notice of any adjustments to the Conversion Price shall be given by the Issuer to Bondholders and the Loan Trustee promptly after the determination thereof.
Norsk Tillitsmaim ASA
Execution Version
The Conversion Price shall not in any event be reduced to below the nominal value of the Shares and the Issuer undertakes that it shall not take any action, and shall procure that no action is taken, that would otherwise result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price to below such nominal value.
C.15 If changes are made in the share capital other than those mentioned above, which are unfavourable to the Bondholders compared to the Shareholders, the Loan Trustee and the Issuer shall agree on a new Conversion Price. This also applies to other transactions, which are unfavourable to the Bondholders.
C.16 If the Conversion Price is below par value of the Shares, par value of the Shares still applies, and the Issuer shall upon conversion pay the Bondholders the difference between the par value of the Shares and the Conversion Price.
C.17 If an adjustment of the Conversion Price requires a conversion to USD, the exchange rate shall be the Exchange Rate on the date triggering such adjustments. For the avoidance of doubt, when calculating weighted averages over several days, the Exchange Rate should be applied on each relevant day.
C. 18 For the sake of clarity, no adjustment shall be made for the issue of Warrants to the NEC06 lenders (Warrants to subscribe for 7,500,000 shares pre the Reverse Share Split at NOK 0.28 per share) or an exercise of such Warrants.
