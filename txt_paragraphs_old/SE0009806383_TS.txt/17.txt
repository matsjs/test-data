History Prime Living was founded in February 2009 in connection to the acquisition of the properties Ferdinand 8 and 10 in Spånga, Stockholm. The Company has since then developed a revolutionary concept with a production method based on steel modules with standardized fast linking strongholds for lifting and shipping. Prime Living specializes in utilizing the advantages that comes with prefabrication of residential units and has developed installation and connections on the building site which shortens construction times and minimizes production errors. The company has always strived to control the entire value chain of the modular concept. In line with this, in 2016 Prime Living established a new division, Prime Living Industries. The division handles all aspects of turnkey projects, from design to procurement and construction of residential modules. Prime Living has currently offices in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö.
Production The residential modules have a steel frame and are produced in an external factory in south of China through a cooperation between Prime Living and state-owned Chinese actors. Prime Living contributes with concept, competence and volume, while the Company's cooperation partners deals with the local production with specially worked out control functions. The system complies in every aspect with building regulations, energy requirements and accessibility rules. At the same time, the production is carried out at a significantly lower cost than in Sweden. Representatives from Prime Living or its general contractor are present during the production to ensure that the quality is in accordance with Swedish standards. The modules are being shipped by boat from China and transported to the most suitable port. In our markets the distances are relatively short between the port and construction site, which means that Prime Living usually can initiate the installation of the modules within a few hours after the arrival of the boat. The modules are provided with so called container feet, which makes shipping, lifting and installation standardized. The installation on site will be carried out by a specialized installation team to minimize construction time, and thus costs. The standardized construction process means in that the installation team repeats the same construction, which makes them highly specialized. The container feet of the modules makes it easy to disassemble and move the modules, which simplifies both reuse of modules and recycling of the steel.
Advantages o f module construction The accommodations are built with module construction, which the Company believes has many advantages.
· FAST - Short project times since the finished modules are transported isolated and fully equipped.
· MOVABLE - The system is fully modular, which means that land with shorter, temporary lease, can be
utilized.
· QUALITY - The prefabrication implies that the quality is ensured in the factory.
