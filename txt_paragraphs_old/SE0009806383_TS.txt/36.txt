"Issuer" means Prime Living AB (publ), reg. no. 556715-7929, having its registered address at Box 5317, 102 47 Stockholm, Sweden.
"Loan to Value" means, expressed as a percentage, the ratio of:
(a) the Net Interest Bearing Debt of the Group; to
(b) the aggregate market value of the Properties as set out in the latest valuations delivered under these Terms and Conditions; and
(c) an amount equal to the costs and expenses paid in relation to any on-going value enhancing investments in the Properties and any costs and expenses paid in relation to any value enhancing investments in the Properties completed since the latest valuation.
"Make Whole Amount" means an amount equal to the sum of:
(a) the present value on the relevant record date of 100 per cent, of the Nominal Amount as if such payment originally should have taken place on the Final Redemption Date; and
(b) the present value on the relevant record date of the remaining interest payments (excluding accrued but unpaid interest up to the relevant record date) up to and including the Final Redemption Date (assuming that the Interest Rate for the period from the relevant record date to the Final Redemption Date will be equal to the Interest Rate in effect on the date on which notice of redemption is given to the Bondholders);
both calculated by using a discount rate of 50 basis points over the comparable Swedish Government Bond Rate on the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which the applicable notice of redemption is given (i.e. comparable to the remaining duration of the Bonds until the Final Redemption Date) and where "relevant record date" shall mean a date agreed upon between, the Agent, the CSD and the Issuer in connection with such repayment.
