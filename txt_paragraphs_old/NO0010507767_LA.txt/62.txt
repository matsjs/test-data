(c) if the consideration or price determined pursuant to (a) or (b) above (or any component thereof) shall be expressed hi a currency other than Norwegian Kroner it shall be converted into Norwegian Kroner at such rate o f exchange as may be determined in good faith by an Independent Financial Adviser to be the spot rate ruling at tire close o f business on the date of the first public announcement o f the terms o f issue of such Securities (or if no such rate is available on that date, the equivalent rate on the immediately preceding date on which such rate is available); and
14.12 If the Conversion Date in relation to the conversion of any Bond shall be after any consolidation or sub-division as is mentioned in clause 14.1, or after the record date or other due date for the establishment of entitlement for any such issue, distribution, grant or offer (as the case may be) as is mentioned in clauses 14.2,14.3,14.4,14.5 or 14.9, or after any such issue or grant as is mentioned in clause 14.6 and 14.7, in any case in circumstances where the relevant Conversion Date falls before the relevant adjustment becomes effective under clause 14 (such adjustment, a "Retroactive Adjustment"), then the Borrower shall (conditional upon the relevant adjustment becoming effective) procure that there shall be issued or delivered to the converting Bondholder, such additional number o f Shares (if any) (the "Additional Shares") as, together with the Shares issued or to be issued or delivered on conversion of the relevant Bond (together with any fraction of a Share not so issued), is equal to the number of Shares which would have been required to be issued or delivered on conversion o f such Bond if the relevant adjustment (more particularly referred to in the said provisions of clause 14) to the Conversion Price had in fact been made and become effective immediately prior to the relevant Conversion Date. Additional Shares will be delivered to Bondholders not later than 10 Banking Days following the date the relevant Retroactive Adjustment becomes effective (the "Reference Date").

employees (including Directors holding or formerly holding executive office or the personal service company o f any such person) or their spouses or relatives, in each case, o f the Borrower or any o f its Subsidiaries or any associated company or to trustees to be held for the benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to any employees' share or option scheme.
14.14 On any adjustment, the resultant Conversion Price, if not an integral multiple o f USD 0.01, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of USD 0.01. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price where such adjustment (rounded down if applicable) would be less than one per cent, of the Conversion Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any amount by which the Conversion Price has been rounded down, shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and such subsequent adjustment shall be made on the basis that the adjustment not required to be made had been made at the relevant time.
Notice of any adjustments to the Conversion Price shall be given by the Borrower to Bondholders and the Loan Trustee promptly after the determination thereof.
The Conversion Price shall not in any event be reduced to below the nominal value of the Shares and the Borrower undertakes that it shall not take any action, and shall procure that no action is taken, that would otherwise result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price to below such nominal value.
