Interest accrued since the latest Interest Payment Date shall be calculated and falls due and will be paid by way of converting the due interest amount into Shares together with the conversion o f the principal amount.
13.5 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bonds held by any relevant Bondholder may not be converted to the extent that following conversion such Bondholder(s) on a fully consolidated basis would be the beneficial owner o f thirty-three and one third (33 1/3) percent or more of the outstanding Shares of the Borrower. For the purpose of calculating the beneficial ownership of relevant Bondholders), the Conversion Shares shall be aggregated with the total beneficial ownership o f such Bondholder(s) on a fully consolidated basis, including any rights to shares (including but not limited to futures, forwards, call- or put options, TRS-agreements and other derivates) if the Norwegian Securities Trading Regulation relating to take-over bids has been amended to include such rights to shares at the time of conversion. Each Bondholder shall decide if conversion o f its Bonds can be effected.
13.6 The Borrower is responsible for ensuring that:
(a) the share capital increase is registered in the company register as soon as possible,
(b) the Remaining Loan is being written down within the Conversion Date, and
(c) Shares issued upon conversion are registered in the Securities Depository on the Conversion Date.
I f the share capital increase is not registered in the Company Register at the Conversion Date, die Borrower shall ensure that the shares following the conversion shall be temporarily registered in the Securities Depository (with temporary ISDSf).
13.7 Shares issued upon conversion give rights in the Borrower as o f the registration of the share capital increase in the Company Register, unless the general meeting of the Borrower has resolved differently.
