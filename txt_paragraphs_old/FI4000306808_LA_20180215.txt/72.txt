EXECUTION COPY
(c) Funds that the Agent receives (directly or indirectly) in connection with the accelera tion of the Bonds or the enforcement of the Transaction Security constitute escrow funds and must be held on a separate interest-bearing account on behalf of the Bond holders and the other interested parties. The Agent shall arrange for payments of such funds in accordance with this Clause 18 (Allocation o fProceeds) as soon as reasonably practicable.
(d) If the Issuer or the Agent shall make any payment under this Clause 18 (Allocation o f Proceeds), the Issuer or the Agent, as applicable, shall notify the Bondholders of any such payment at least fifteen (15) Business Days before the payment is made. Such no tice shall specify the Record Date, the payment date and the amount to be paid. Not withstanding the foregoing, for any Interest due but unpaid the Record Date specified in Clause 10(a) (Payment in respect o f the Bonds) shall apply.
DECISIONS BY BONDHOLDERS
(a) A request by the Agent for a decision by the Bondholders on a matter relating to the Finance Documents shall (at the option of the Agent) be dealt with at a Bondholders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure.
(b) Any request from the Issuer or a Bondholder (or Bondholders) representing at least ten (10) per cent. of the Adjusted Nominal Amount (such request may only be validly made by a Person who is a Bondholder on the Business Day immediately following the day on which the request is received by the Agent and shall, if made by several Bond holders, be made by them jointly) for a decision by the Bondholders on a matter relat ing to the Finance Documents shall be directed to the Agent and dealt with at a Bond holders' Meeting or by way a Written Procedure, as determined by the Agent. The Per son requesting the decision may suggest the form for decision making, but if it is in the Agent's opinion more appropriate that a matter is dealt with at a Bondholders' Meet ing than by way of a Written Procedure, it shall be dealt with at a Bondholders' Meet ing.
