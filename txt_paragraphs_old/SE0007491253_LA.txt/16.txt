The Issuer may, at one or more occasions, issue Subsequent Bonds amounting to in total up to the difference of SEK 500,000,000 and the aggregate Nominal Amount of the Initial Bonds, provided that items (a) and (c) of the Maintenance Test are met (calculated pro forma including such issue). Subsequent Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to these Terms and Conditions and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the Interest Rate, the Nominal Amount, the Final Redemption Date shall apply also to Subsequent Bonds, which also otherwise shall have the same rights as the Initial Bonds. The price of Subsequent Bonds may be set at a discount or at a higher price than the Nominal Amount. The maximum total nominal amount of the Bonds (the Initial Bonds and all Subsequent Bonds) may not exceed SEK 500,000,000.
The Bonds are denominated in SEK and each Bond is constituted by these Terms and Conditions.
By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Holder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to these Terms and Conditions and by acquiring Bonds each subsequent Holder confirms these Terms and Conditions.
STATUS OF THE BONDS
The Bonds constitute direct, general, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu with all direct, general, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and without any preference among them.
