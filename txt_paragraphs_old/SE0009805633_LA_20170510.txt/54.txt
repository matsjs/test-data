20. Appointment and Replacement of the Agent
20.1 Appointment of Agent
(a) By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Bondholder appoints the Agent to act as its agent in all matters relating to the Bonds and the Finance Documents, and authorises the Agent to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent, unless such consent is specifically required by these Terms and Conditions), and confirms the appointment under the Intercreditor Agreement of the Agent to act on its behalf, in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Bonds held by such Bondholder including any legal or arbitration proceeding relating to the perfection, preservation, protection or enforcement of the Transaction Security, and agrees that the rights, obligations, role of and limitations of liability for the Agent in its capacity as security agent are further regulated in the Intercreditor Agreement.
(b) By acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Bondholder confirms the appointment and authorisation for the Agent to act on its behalf, as set forth in Clause 20.1(a). The appointment of the Agent shall also constitute an appointment of the Agent as the representative (Da: repræsentant) of each Bondholder under and in accordance with Chapter 2a of the Danish Security Trading Act (Da: værdipapirhandelsloven).
(c) Each Bondholder shall immediately upon request provide the Agent with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent), that the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents. The Agent is not under any obligation to represent a Bondholder which does not comply with such request.
