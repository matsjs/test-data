12. Incurrence Test
(a) The Incurrence Test is met if:
(1) the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA is not greater than:
(A) 4.00 from the First Issue Date until (and including) the second anniversary of the First Issue Date;
(B) 3.75 from the second anniversary of the First Issue Date until (and including) the third anniversary of the First Issue Date; and
(C) 3.50 from the third anniversary of the First Issue Date until (and including) the Final Maturity Date; and
(ii) no Event of Default is continuing or would occur upon the incurrence of Financial Indebtedness or the Restricted Payment (as applicable).
(b) The calculation of the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no more than two (2) months prior to the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness or the making of a Restricted Payment. The Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date so determined, but include the new Financial Indebtedness provided it is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt).
