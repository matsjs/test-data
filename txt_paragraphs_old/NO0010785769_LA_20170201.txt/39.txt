The Parent irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to indemnify the Guaranteed Parties upon request in accordance with Clause 10.2 (Claims under the Guarantee) against any cost, loss or liability suffered by the Guaranteed Parties if any of the Guaranteed Obligations for whatever reason is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal. The amount of the cost, loss or liability shall be equal to the amount which the Guaranteed Parties would otherwise have been entitled to recover.
The Parent undertakes to pay any stamp duty that may become payable in connection with the Guarantee.
Claims under the Guarantee
The Agent may make a claim under the Guarantee by sending a written request to the Parent specifying the amount demanded, and the bank and account to which it shall be paid. The Agent shall in the request certify that the requested amount is due and payable as a part of the Guaranteed Obligations and that it has not been paid by the Issuer (where it shall be noted that the Agent will solely rely upon information it may have received from the CSD, the Paying Agent, the Noteholders or other third parties). No other evidence of the amount due shall be necessary to claim under the Guarantee.
