The notice is irrevocable but may, at the Issuer's discretion, contain one or more conditions precedent. Upon fulfilment of the conditions precedent (if any), the Issuer is bound to redeem the Notes in full at the applicable amount on the specified Redemption Date. If the notice contains conditions precedent, the Issuer must no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Redemption Date either confirm or retract the notice.
