(1) Sales in the period include the contracts that were included in the sale of the energy company Enerpar-Energias do Parana Ltda. in Brazil. Gains and losses related to the realised volume from contracts in level 3 are recognised in the income statement within Other gains and losses.
The fair value of commodity contracts recognised in the balance sheet is calculated by using quotes from actively traded markets when available. Otherwise, price forecasts from acknowledged external sources are used. Commodity contracts that fail to meet the own-use exemption criteria in IAS 39 are recognised in the balance sheet and valued on the same principle as financial contracts. Some of these are long-term energy contracts. In calculating the fair value of em bedded derivatives, valuation techniques are used in the absence of observable market inputs. Em bedded currency options are calculated using a Black 76 valuation model, where some input assumptions have been made in absence of an active long-term option market.
The following table is presented in accordance with IFRS 7.27, showing the fair value of commodity contracts in level 3 given a change in assumptions to a reasonably possible alternative.
