All payments made by or on behalf of the Exchange Notes Issuer or any Guarantors under or with respect to the Exchange Notes (whether or not in the form of Definitive Registered Notes) or any Exchange Note Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Exchange Notes Issuer or any Guarantor is then incorporated or organized, engaged in business or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision thereof or therein or (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the Exchange Notes Issuer or any subsequent Guarantor (including, without limitation, the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent) or any political subdivision thereof or therein (each of (1) and (2), a ``Tax Jurisdiction'') will at any time be required to be made from any payments under or with respect to the Exchange Notes or any Exchange Note Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, the Exchange Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the ``Additional Amounts'') as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder of Exchange Notes after such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; p r o v id e d , h o w e v e r, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:
(1) any Taxes that would not have been imposed or levied but for the existence of any present or former connection between the holder or the beneficial owner of the Exchange Notes and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being a citizen, national or resident of such Tax Jurisdiction for tax purposes or having been engaged in a trade or business, being, or having been, physically present in or having had a permanent establishment in such Tax Jurisdiction), other than the acquisition or holding of such Note, the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note or the Exchange Notes Indenture or under a Exchange Note Guarantee or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note or a Exchange Note Guarantee;
(2) any Taxes imposed or levied as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);
(3) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, personal property, transfer or similar Taxes;
(4) any Taxes withheld, deducted, imposed or levied on a payment to an individual that are required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive;
(5) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner of Exchange Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;
(6) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments made under, or with respect to, the Exchange Notes or with respect to any Exchange Note Guarantee;
(7) any Taxes imposed, levied or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of Exchange Notes to comply with any reasonable written request of the Exchange Notes Issuer (made at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request) to satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;
