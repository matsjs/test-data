Our operations in Australasia source most of their energy needs by purchasing electricity from third parties, with most energy consumption covered by long-term contracts. Each of our mills in Australasia purchases electricity through long-term contracts with fixed volumes and price, which expire between 2020 and 2023. In addition, our Albury mill purchases gas to produce steam under contract until 2016, and the gas needed for drying the LWC paper at the Boyer mill is sourced through a long-term contract to late 2018. Our Tasman operations also operate a geothermal energy plant commissioned in January 2013.
Wood
Wood purchases for our mills accounted for 13% of our total operating expenses as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Total wood consumption by our wholly-owned mills for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 4.2 million cubic meters at a total cost of NOK 1,610 million. We purchase our wood in Australia pursuant to long-term contracts with fixed volumes and price expiring in 2020. At our Boyer mill, approximately 69% of its forest supply is derived from its 20,000 hectares of forest assets. In Norway and continental Europe, wood is purchased pursuant to short- and medium-term contracts. In every country where we source wood, the area of land under forest is increasing.
Recovered paper
Recovered paper is an important fiber source for us. As of September 30, 2014, purchases of recovered paper accounted for 9% of our total operating expenses. In the year ended December 30, 2013, we consumed 1.1 million tons, of which 0.85 million tons was consumed in Europe. We purchase our recovered paper through short- to medium-term contracts, mostly from local producers. Their prices for recovered paper, which are largely driven by strong demand from China, has been stable in both 2013 and 2014.
Chemical pulp
As of September 30, 2014, purchases of chemical pulp accounted for 4% of our total operating expenses. Consumption of chemical pulp, which is used primarily in the production of magazine paper,
