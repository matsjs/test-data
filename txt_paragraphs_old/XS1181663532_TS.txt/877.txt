Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consists primarily of physical energy contracts. The fair value of commodity contracts is particularly sensitive to future fluctuations in energy prices. The fair value of embedded derivatives in physical contracts depends on currency and price index fluctuations.
Higher energy prices have a positive impact on fair value. Energy prices in New Zealand have increased in the short end of the price curve while the prices in the long end are virtually unchanged compared with the previous quarter.
Changes in the value of energy-/commodity contracts and embedded derivatives in contracts are presented in the income statement line Other gains and losses. Realised effects from financial energy contracts are also included in this accounting line.
