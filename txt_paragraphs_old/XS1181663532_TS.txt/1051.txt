The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on a parallel shift in the yield curve for each relevant currency to which Norske Skog is exposed. Following a 50 basis point downward/upward parallel shift in the yield curve in all interest rate markets to which Norske Skog is exposed, net earnings would have been NOK 1 million higher/lower at 31 December 2014 (NOK 2 million lower/higher at 31 December 2013). Change in net interest payments accounts for n Ok 1million, and the total change in market values of derivatives carried at fair value through profit or loss accounts for NOK 0 million.

8. FINANCIAL RISK AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING (Continued)
b) Currency risk
Transaction r is k - c a s h flo w h e d g e
The group has revenues and expenses in various currencies. The major currencies are NOK, EUR, USD, GBR AUD and NZD. Transaction risk arises because the group has a different currency split on income and expenses. Norske Skog calculates a 12-month future cash flow exposure in each currency on a rolling basis. The result of the hedging is included in Financial items in the income statement. Norske Skog does not use hedge accounting for the rolling cash flow hedge. The rolling cash flow hedge generated a gain of NOK 2 million in 2014 (loss of NOK 66 million in 2013). Over time, currency losses or earnings are expected to offset increased or reduced future gross operating earnings. The cash flow hedge program was closed during 2014.
T ranslation ris k -- n e t in v e s tm e n t h e d g e
The presentational currency of the Norske Skog group is NOK. Currency translation risk arises when the financial statements of subsidiaries, presented in local currencies, are translated into NOK. In order to reduce translation risk, assets and liabilities are allocated to the same currency. In addition to traditional debt instruments, all combined currency and interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts are also used for hedging net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Norske Skog's net investment hedging is carried out in accordance with IAS 39. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity and offset by translation differences from assets in subsidiaries. The gain or loss related to the ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the income statement. There was no ineffectiveness related to net investment hedge in 2014 or 2013. The effective portion recognised in equity was a loss of NOK 151million in 2014 (loss of NOK 243 million in 2013). The portion of the debt portfolio to which hedge accounting does not apply, was somewhat smaller in 2014 than in 2013. The Foreign exchange gains and losses from such liabilities are recognised in the income statement under Financial items.
