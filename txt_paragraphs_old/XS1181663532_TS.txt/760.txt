Luxembourg
Although there is no treaty between Luxembourg and the United States regarding the reciprocal enforcement of judgments, a valid, final and conclusive judgment against the Temporary Notes Issuer, obtained from a state or federal court of the United States, which judgment remains in full force and effect, may be enforced through a court of competent jurisdiction in Luxembourg, subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures (e x e q u a tu r) as set out in the relevant provisions of the Luxembourg New Civil Procedure Code. Pursuant to Luxembourg case law, the granting of e x e q u a tu r is subject to the following requirements:
(a) the U.S. judgment must be enforceable in the United States;
(b) the U.S. court awarding the judgment must have had jurisdiction both according to its own laws and to the Luxembourg conflict of jurisdictions rules;
(c) the U.S. court procedure must have been regular according to the laws of the United States and must not violate the rights of defence;
(d) the U.S. court must have applied the law which is designated by Luxembourg conflict of law rules, or, at least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying these rules (based on case law and legal doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be required for an exequatur to be granted by a Luxembourg court);
(e) the U.S. judgment must not contravene Luxembourg international public policy or must not have been given in proceedings of a tax or criminal nature; and
(f) the U.S. judgment must not have been rendered subsequent to an evasion of Luxembourg law
