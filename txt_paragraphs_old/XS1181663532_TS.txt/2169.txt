8. FINANCIAL RISK AND HEDGE ACCO UNTING (Continued)
Credit risk
Norske Skog makes a credit evaluation of all financial trading counterparties. The credit risk evaluation is based on credit rating and C D S (Credit Default Swap). Based on the evaluation, a limit on credit exposure is established for each counterparty. These limits are monitored continuously in relation to unrealised profit on financial instruments and placements. The maximum credit risk arising from financial instruments is represented by the carrying amount of financial assets in the balance sheet. This includes derivatives with positive market value except for em bedded derivatives. Em bedded derivatives are not subjected to credit risk, as there are no future cash flows associated with such derivatives.
Norske Skog's routines for credit managem ent of trade receivables and the authority to grant credit to customers are decentralised to the sales function. An integrated credit-assessment application is used to continuously monitor the development of overdue amounts.
9. DERIVATIVES Fair value of derivatives
The table below classifies financial instruments measured in the balance sheet at fair value, by valuation method. The different valuation methods are described as levels and are defined as follows:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
