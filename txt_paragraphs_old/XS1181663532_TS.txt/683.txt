· remuneration owed to employees.
Luxembourg insolvency law may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Temporary Notes Issuer during the hardening period (p e rio d e s u s p e c te ) (which is a maximum of 6 (six) months and 10 (ten) days) preceding the judgment adjudicating the insolvency proceedings, in particular, the granting of a security right for antecedent debt, the payment of debt not due (whether or not payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means) or of debt due by any means other than cash or bill of exchange or the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration. These transactions must be declared null and void, in all circumstances, at the request of the competent Luxembourg insolvency official (including any c o m m is s a ire , ju g e - c o m m is s a ire , liq u id a te u r o r c u ra te u r or similar official). Further, if the insolvency official demonstrates that (i) an adequate payment in relation to a due debt was made during the hardening period to the detriment of the general body of creditors, and/or (ii) the party receiving such payment knew that the company had ceased payments when such payment occurred, the insolvency official has the power, among other things, to invalidate such preferential transaction. Notwithstanding the above, a financial collateral arrangement under the Collateral Act entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the entry into force of reorganization measures is valid and binding against third parties or insolvency officials notwithstanding the hardening period if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the opening of such proceedings or of the taking of such measures or that it could not reasonably have been aware of them. Generally, if the insolvency official demonstrates that the Issuer has given a preference to any person by defrauding the rights of creditors generally, a competent insolvency official (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the power to challenge such preferential transaction (including the granting of security right with fraudulent intent) without limitation of time.
In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in an automatic termination of contracts except for personal (in tu itu p e rs o n a e ) contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its solvency were crucial. However, the insolvency official may choose to terminate certain onerous contracts. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue v is -a -v is the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the Temporary Notes Issuer's business and assets and the Temporary Notes Issuer's obligations under the Temporary Notes (as Temporary Notes Issuer).
Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation.
