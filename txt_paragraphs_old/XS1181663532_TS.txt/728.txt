If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company's management, it can be deemed to be a de facto manager of such company (d irig e a n t d e fa it). In such a case, Article L. 651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that, if judicial liquidation proceedings (liq u id a tio n ju d ic ia ir e ) have been commenced against the debtor, the creditor may be liable for bearing the excess of liabilities over the company's assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case may be, if it is established that their mismanagement contributed to the company's shortfall of assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part of the shortfall amount.
As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose claims arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings must file a proof of claim with the court-appointed creditors' representative (m a n d a ta ire ju d ic ia ir e ) within two months of the publication of the court order in the B u lle tin O ffic ie l d e s A n n o n c e s C iv ile s e t C o m m e rc ia le s (in an exception, the deadline begins upon the receipt of an individual notification for those creditors whose claims arose out of a published contract or who benefit from a published security interest); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Where the debtor has informed the creditors' representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of claim has been filed yet, such claim is deemed filed with the creditors' representative. Creditors are allowed to confirm a proof of claim made on their behalf. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed with the creditors' representative, save for a ratification by the creditor of a proof of claim made on its behalf, are barred, except with respect to very limited exceptions, from receiving distributions made in accordance with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limits and are preferential creditors under French law.
In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debts held by creditors affected by the opening of the relevant proceedings that took part in the conciliation negotiation are listed by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor (or, in its absence, its accountant) are thus deemed to have been filed. Although such creditors can file proofs of claim pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts of their claims as set forth on the list prepared by the debtor (within the two or four months' time limit). Those creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings (even though they would be party to the creditors' committee or the bondholders' general assembly) would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned legal time limit.
From the date of the court order commencing the insolvency proceedings (safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings), the company is prohibited from paying (i) debts outstanding prior to that date, subject to specified exceptions, which essentially concern the set-off of interrelated debts and payments made to recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business, provided that such payments are authorized by the bankruptcy judge and (ii) debts arising after the opening of the proceedings if such debts are not useful to the proceedings (post-opening, non-privileged debts). During this period, creditors may not pursue any legal action against the company with respect to any claim arising prior to the court order commencing the proceedings or, as the case may be, for the aforementioned post-opening, non-privileged debts if the objective of such legal action is:
· to obtain an order for or a payment of a sum of money by the company to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that the court fix the amount due); or
· to terminate a contract for the non payment of pre-petition amounts owed by the company; or
· to enforce the creditor's rights against any assets of the company, except where such asset, whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, is located in another Member State, in which case the rights in re m of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency procedure, in accordance with the terms of Article 5 of EU Insolvency Regulation 1346/2000.
Debts arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the business's activities during the observation period or are for the requirements of the proceedings, or are in consideration for a service rendered to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if such is not the case, they will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as the New Money Lien).
