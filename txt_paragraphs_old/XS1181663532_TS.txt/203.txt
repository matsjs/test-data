N e w s p rin t. Operating revenue from our Newsprint segment in 2013 decreased by 14.2% to NOK 8,701 million, compared to NOK 10,145 million in 2012. Total volume of newsprint sold in 2013 decreased by 12.2% to 2,001,000 tons, compared to 2,280,000 tons in 2012. The decrease in operating revenue for newsprint was primarily due to reduced capacity.
--E u ro p e . Operating revenue from our Newsprint segment in Europe decreased by 2.0% to NOK 4,437 million in 2013, compared to NOK 4,528 million in 2012, which reflected the impact of the closure and disposal of our Follum mill in Norway (March 2012) as well as lower European newsprint prices. Total volume of European newsprint sold by us in 2013 remained flat at 1,188,000 tons, compared to 1,187,000 tons in 2012. While aggregate demand for newsprint in Europe declined by 5.8% during 2013, demand for improved and other uncoated grades of newsprint increased by 0.6%. Sales prices for our newsprint in Europe (measured in Euro) were 5.0% lower in 2013 than in 2012.
-- O u ts id e E u ro p e . Operating revenue from our Newsprint segment outside Europe decreased by 27.6% to NOK 3,809 million in 2013, compared to NOK 5,263 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily attributable to the sales of our operations in Chile, Brazil and Thailand and the closure of one newsprint paper machine at Tasman in New Zealand in January 2013. Total volume of newsprint sold by us outside of Europe in 2013 declined from 1,093,000 tons in 2012 to 813,000 tons in 2013. The decline in demand for newsprint in Australasia was 17.0% and reflected, to a large extent, strategic changes in the distribution of printed publications by leading publishers in Australasia. Sales prices for our newsprint outside of Europe decreased slightly in 2013 as compared to 2012.

M a g a z in e P a p e r. Operating revenue from our Magazine Paper segment in 2013 decreased by 20.2% to NOK 4,992 million, compared to NOK 6,254 million in 2012. Total volume of magazine paper sold by us in 2013 decreased by approximately 20.2% to 1,049,000 tons, compared to 1,308,000 tons in 2012. The decrease in operating revenue was primarily due to the sale of our Parenco facilities in the Netherlands and the closure of the Follum mill. Demand for magazine paper in Europe declined broadly with a 0.6% decrease in demand for uncoated mechanical paper and a demand decline of 6.4% for coated mechanical paper. Sales prices (measured in Euro) for magazine paper in Europe decreased slightly in 2013 compared to 2012, based on prices in Germany established by RISI.
O th e r A c tiv itie s . Operating revenue from Other Activities in 2013 decreased to NOK 313 million, compared to NOK 2,315 million in 2012. The decrease reflected less intercompany sales of energy and wood as responsibility for these operations was transferred from the corporate group to the mills during 2013. The decrease also reflected the impact of the sale in August 2012 of the Reparco global recovered paper business (whose results of operations were reported in this segment).
