Trustee

creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the La Haye Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of ``trust'' has not been generally recognized under French law. To the extent that the Security Interests in the Collateral created under the trust construct are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the Collateral securing the trustee rights.
Fraudulent conveyance
French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside insolvency proceedings, the ` `a c tio n p a u lie n n e '' provisions, which offer creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such person guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such person's or a third party's obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant person by the creditors' representative (m a n d a ta ire ju d ic ia ir e ) , the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (c o m m is s a ire a I 'e x e c u tio n d u p la n ), insolvency proceedings of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings, and may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person's insolvency proceedings, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such person's creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (a titre g ra tu it), in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance. If a court found that the granting of a guarantee by the French Guarantor involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defence under applicable law, then the granting of such guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Guarantee and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Guarantee could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the French Guarantor as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.
Germany
Insolvency
In the event of insolvency of a guarantor or a provider of collateral organized under the laws of Germany and/or having its centre of main interests in Germany (the ``German Providers'') any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law.
The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (In s o lv e n z o rd n u n g ), may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as Security Interests and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.
