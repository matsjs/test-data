December 2019 and is structurally senior to all remaining existing notes and notes issued in the exchange offer.

In January, prior to the offering of the SSN and the exchange offer, several changes in the Norske Skog corporate structure were made. Norske Skog AS was established as the issuer of the SSN, while Norske Skog Holding AS was established as the offeror of the exchange notes.
NET INTEREST-BEARING DEBT
Norske Skog has recognised an amount in the balance sheet as a result of the termination of a large part of the fair value hedge portfolio in the first half of 2009. A hedge reserve (deferred income) amounting to NOK 78 million is included in interest-bearing debt at 31 March 2015. The corresponding figure at 31 December 2014 was NOK 174 million.
The hedge reserve does not constitute any payment obligation for the group, but will be amortised in the income statement over the lifetime of the debt that has been hedged. The change in the hedge reserve this quarter is due to realisation of a part of the hedge reserve as a consequence of the exchange offer.
