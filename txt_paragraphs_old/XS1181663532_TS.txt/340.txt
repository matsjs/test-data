Our Albury mill is the youngest mill in the Australasian segment. Its single machine was commissioned in 1981 and produces standard newsprint. The mill underwent a significant rebuild in 2006, which included the addition of a shoe press. Total production capacity and utilization at our Albury mill were 270,000 tons and 91%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,2013, with an actual production of 246,000 tons of newsprint. Our Albury mill has a long-term power contract until 2022 for delivery of approximately 0.7 TWh of electricity annually, which is sufficient to cover all of its expected annual energy consumption. In addition, our Albury mill purchases gas to produce steam under a contract terminating in 2016. Prior to the termination of this contract, another gas supply agreement will need to be finalized, and preparations are being made for its negotiation. It is expected that any new gas supply arrangement will come at a greater cost than current arrangements. Gas prices in the eastern Australian market are rising and moving away from the domestic price of gas towards the international market price of gas (which has, in the past, been much higher than the domestic price paid). Albury benefits from a favorable location with low distribution costs to the major Australian metropolitan regions of Melbourne and Sydney. Albury produces newsprint using both wood and recycled fiber. Almost 90% of the mill's consumption of wood is supplied by medium-term contracts with terms varying from 2015 to 2018, 35% of the recycled paper is sourced directly from publishers' waste.
Boyer operations
Our Boyer mill was the first mill in our Australasian segment to commence newsprint production. It has two machines, one producing standard and improved newsprint, and one producing LWC magazine paper, using principally wood fiber, the majority of which we source from our own self-managed forests. The first machine, PM2, was commissioned in 1952 and rebuilt in 1991, and during the first quarter of 2014, was converted from newsprint to LWC production. The second machine, PM3, commenced production in 1969 and was rebuilt in 1989 and 1996. Boyer's total production capacity is 150,000 tons of newsprint and 140,000 tons of LWC. In order to achieve the conversion of the PM2 newsprint machine, we had to shut down the machine during the first quarter of 2014. Production of LWC was ramped up during the second quarter of 2014, resulting in a production loss of around 40,000 tons. The PM2 machine started up again in the first half of 2014 and the production of LWC is now running at full capacity. The utilization rate for the newsprint machine was 86% for the year ended December 31,2013. Our Boyer mill has a long-term power contract until 2020 for delivery of approximately 0.8 TWh of electricity annually, which is sufficient to cover all of its expected annual energy consumption. The gas needed for drying the LWC paper is sourced through a long-term contract to late 2018.
Tasm an o pe ra tion s
Our Tasman mill, located in New Zealand, has one paper machine that produces standard and improved newsprint grades using principally wood fiber. The machine, PM3, was rebuilt in 2006. Its total production capacity and utilization were 155,000 tons and 95%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,2013, with an actual production of 148,000 tons of newsprint. Our Tasman mill has a long-term power contract until 2023 for delivery of 0.64 TWh of electricity annually, which is sufficient to cover the annual energy consumption. In January 2013, our Tasman mill commissioned a NZD 43 million investment for the construction of a geothermal power plant to provide an additional source of energy for the mill. The geothermal energy plant is operated by the mill, producing and selling energy both to the mill and to the grid.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used to manufacture our products are energy, wood, recovered paper, chemicals and inorganic fillers and chemical pulp. The prices of these raw materials are subject to commodity price fluctuations. Due to competitive pressures and the fixed-price nature of our customer contracts, the prices of our products are not always correlated with increases and decreases in the cost of raw materials.
