· Change in fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedge on the group's fixed rate bonds will not influence the sensitivity calculation of either the income statement or equity. As a result of fair value hedge accounting, the changes in fair value of interest rate swaps recognised in the income statement are, to a large extent, offset by opposite changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item. Potential ineffectiveness stemming from retrospective effectiveness testing of the hedging relationship is regarded as insignificant to this analysis.
· Currency derivatives will only affect the sensitivity analysis to a very limited extent upon changes in the discount rate.
· Results are presented net of tax, using the Norwegian statutory tax rate of 28 per cent.
The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on a parallel shift in the yield curve for each relevant currency to which Norske Skog is exposed. Following a 50 basis point downward/upward parallel shift in the yield curve in all interest rate markets to which Norske Skog is exposed, net earnings would have been NOK 2 million higher/lower at 31 Decem ber 2011 (NOK 2 million lower/higher at 31 Decem ber 2010). Change in net interest payments accounts for n Ok 3 million, and the total change in market values of derivatives carried at fair value through profit or loss accounts for NOK - 1 million. Floating rate debt has decreased in 2011 due to repayments.
b) Currency risk
Transaction risk-- c a sh flo w h e d g e
The group has revenues and costs in various currencies. The major currencies are NOK, EUR, USD, GBP! AUD and NZD. Transaction risk arises because the group has a different currency split on income and expenses. Norske Skog calculates a 12-month future cash flow exposure in each currency on a rolling basis. The result of the hedging is included in Financial items in the income statement. Norske Skog does not use hedge accounting for the rolling cash flow hedge. The rolling cash flow hedge generated a loss of NOK 13 million in 2011 (gain of NOK 58 million in 2010). Over time, currency losses or earnings are expected to offset increased or reduced future gross operating earnings.
Translation risk-- n e t in v e s tm e n t h e d g e
The presentational currency of the Norske Skog group is NOK. Currency translation risk arises when the financial statements of subsidiaries, presented in local currencies, are translated into NOK. In order to reduce translation risk, assets and liabilities are allocated to the same currency. In addition to traditional
