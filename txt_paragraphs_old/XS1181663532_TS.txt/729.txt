Debts arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the business's activities during the observation period or are for the requirements of the proceedings, or are in consideration for a service rendered to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if such is not the case, they will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as the New Money Lien).
In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however, the above rules only apply to the creditors that are subject to the accelerated safeguard proceedings and the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings respectively (see above).
The debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors (or in its absence, its accountant). Although such creditors can file proofs of claims pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the two or four months' time limit). Those creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceeding (but who would be impacted by the proceedings) would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned legal time limits.
Contractual provisions that would accelerate the payment of the company's obligations upon the occurrence of the opening of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings are not enforceable under French law. The opening of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a company's obligations unless the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a plan for the sale of the business (p la n d e c e s s io n ) is ordered by the court (three months, renewable once), in which case the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the plan for the sale of the business or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. Contractual provisions pursuant to which the opening of the proceedings constitutes an event of default are not enforceable against the debtor, as well as, according to a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n°12-22.909, ``contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization proceedings'' (which should also apply in case of safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings).
The court-appointed administrator may elect to terminate ongoing contracts (c o n tra ts e n c o u rs ) which he or she believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. On the contrary, he or she may require the continuation of such contracts provided that the company fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations, or may decide not to continue them. During reorganization proceedings, when the ongoing contract involves the payment of a sum of money, this payment must be made in cash, unless the administrator obtains extended payment deadlines from the contractual partner of the debtor has been deleted; the administrator is under an obligation to verify that by continuing the contract he or she does not risk creating a foreseeable damage for the contractual partner.
The court can also set a time period during which the assets that it deems necessary to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.
If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business in judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings with a temporary continuation of the business, the proceeds from the sale will be allocated for the payment of creditors according to their ranking.
If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the company, the court will appoint a liquidator to sell the assets of the company and settle the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. However, in practice, if a plan for the sale of the business is under consideration, the court will usually appoint a judicial administrator to manage the company and organize such sale of the business.
French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferential creditors, including employees, officials appointed by the insolvency court as required by the regulations relating to insolvency proceedings, creditors who, as part of the approved conciliation agreement, have provided new money or goods or services, certain secured creditors in the event of judicial liquidation proceedings, post-petition creditors, the French State, other pre-petition secured creditors and pre-petition unsecured creditors.
