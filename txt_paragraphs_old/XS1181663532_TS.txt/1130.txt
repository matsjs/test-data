In addition to the benefit obligation funded through insurance plans, the group has unfunded benefit obligations, of which Norske Skog Walsum GmbH is the largest. The defined benefit scheme at Norske Skog Walsum GmbH was curtailed at the level it had at 31 December 2010, meaning there is no increase in the obligation as a result of salary increases or the time worked for the company after this date. The majority of employees covered by the defined benefit scheme at Norske Skog Walsum are in their late fifties and sixties. Number of retired people is 183. The unfunded obligations also include estimated future obligations relating to the former Norwegian early retirement scheme, pensions to former owners of subsidiaries as well as pensions for senior management and directors. Obligations relating to senior management pensions are partly funded through a supplementary retirement plan with a life insurance company.
