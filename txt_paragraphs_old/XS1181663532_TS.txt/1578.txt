The discount rate applied for the pension schemes in Norway for 2013 is based on the interest rate for covered bonds. Subsidiaries can deviate from these assumptions if local conditions require this. The discount rates applied vary from 3.3% to 3.6%. For Norske Skog Walsum GmbH, the discount rate used is 3.5%. From 2013 Norske Skog has used the new mortality table in Norway (K2013).
