(6) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments made under, or with respect to, the Exchange Notes or with respect to any Exchange Note Guarantee;

In addition to the foregoing, the Exchange Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the holder of Exchange Notes for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise or property Taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties and interest related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction (or any jurisdiction if such Taxes are required to be paid in connection with the enforcement of the Exchange Notes, the Exchange Notes Indenture or any other document referred to therein following the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Exchange Notes) on the execution, delivery, issuance, or registration of any of the Exchange Notes, the Exchange Notes Indenture, any Exchange Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein, or the enforcement of any of the Exchange Notes.
If the Exchange Notes Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Exchange Notes or any Exchange Note Guarantee, each of, the Exchange Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agents on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the Exchange Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer's Certificate(s) must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee and the Paying Agents shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
The Exchange Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make or cause to be made all withholdings and deductions required by law and will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Exchange Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Exchange Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Exchange Notes Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. Upon request, copies of Tax receipts or other evidence of payments, as the case may be, will be made available by the Trustee to the holders or beneficial owners of the Exchange Notes.
Whenever in the Exchange Notes Indenture, the Exchange Notes, or in this ``Description of the Exchange Notes'' there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Exchange Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Exchange Notes or any Exchange Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Exchange Notes Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Exchange Notes, and will apply, m u ta tis m u ta n d is , to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Exchange Notes Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment on the Exchange Notes (or any Exchange Note Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.
