The market for publication paper in Europe is highly competitive. According to PPPC, we currently provide 13% of newsprint, 6% of coated mechanical paper and 7% of uncoated mechanical paper capacity in Europe. Our principal competitors in Europe include UPM Kymmene Corporation, Stora Enso Oyj, Holmen AB, Cartiere Burgo SpA. Newsprint and magazine paper are generally subject to the same supply and demand trends, although newsprint is still approximately 80% consumed by newspapers and printed in cold set. However, a growing share of newsprint is being printed in heat set
for free standing advertising. Magazine paper is more exposed to advertising trends and printed in a variety of printing methods. Advertising content typically comprises a larger proportion of magazine publications than newspapers and magazine paper has a larger share going to direct commercial usage, such as door drop. Depending on the capacity utilization of the production facilities of North American paper companies, as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar, our newsprint products sold in Europe also compete with exports to Europe from North America, where our primary competitor is Resolute Forest Products. North American market share (by volume) of the newsprint market in Europe has declined from approximately 7% in 2000 to approximately 2.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.
Publication Paper Australasia Publication Paper Australasia accounted for 25% of our operating revenue, 32% of our gross operating earnings and 24% of our total production capacity as of the nine months ended September 30, 2014. We have three mills in Australasia, two in Australia and one in New Zealand, with a total production capacity of 715,000 tons. Each of the three mills has one newsprint machine, contributing to a total regional newsprint capacity of 575,000 tons (or 19% of our total production capacity). As of April 1,2014, after the conversion of one paper machine at our Boyer mill from newsprint to coated mechanical, we had 140,000 tons of magazine paper capacity in the region (or 19.6% of our total production capacity in the region).

The majority of the raw material needed for our operations in Australasia is procured under medium- and long-term contracts, with expiry as late as 2023, depending on location and type of material supplied. Materials required vary from mill to mill as further described below. A lb u ry : Albury is currently the only newsprint mill to utilize recovered paper within the Australasian region. It consumes approximately 100,000 tons of recycled paper, of which about 35% is publishers' waste, with the balance purchased on the spot market. Approximately 415,000 cubic meters of wood are also used at Albury, with 80% being supplied under medium-term contracts (with expiry dates ranging up to 2018). The balance of Albury's wood needs is purchased on the spot market. B o y e r: Boyer owns and manages 20,000 hectares of forest assets that supply the majority (approximately 65%) of its total wood fiber requirements. The balance of its wood fiber requirements are purchased under long-term supply contracts with expiry ranging from 2015 to 2022. Approximately 560,000 cubic meters of wood are used at Boyer. The Boyer mill purchases its main coating chemicals for the production of magazine paper from a supplier that recently built a new chemical plant at our mill site, in connection with the start-up of our magazine production in 2014. T asm a n: Tasman benefits from relatively low cost wood fiber, of which approximately 335,000 cubic meters are consumed per year. Long-term contracts for the supply of logs are in place, with expiry between 2020 and 2029. Woodchip supply contracts are for between three to five years.
