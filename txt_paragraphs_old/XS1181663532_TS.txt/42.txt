The Exchange Notes Issuer
The Transactions
As part of our strategy to continue to actively manage our indebtedness, upon the Escrow Release, we used the proceeds from the Offering of the Senior Secured Notes to address a portion of the short-term and medium-term maturities of the Parent's outstanding Existing Notes, for working capital purposes and to pay the fees and expenses associated with the Transactions. The Parent's outstanding Existing Notes mature in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2033. Concurrently with this Offering, the Exchange Notes Issuer offered the eligible holders of each series of the Parent's outstanding Existing Notes to exchange each series of Existing Notes for newly-issued Exchange Notes and, if applicable to such series, cash, pursuant to the terms of the Proposed Exchange Offers. The Exchange Notes Issuer also solicited consents from the eligible holders of each series of the Parent's outstanding Existing Notes through its Proposed Consent Solicitations. The Exchange Notes were issued by the Exchange Notes Issuer on February 24, 2015.

The Escrow Release and Special Mandatory Redemption Prior to the closing of the Offering of the Temporary Notes, the Issuer deposited the Pre-Funded Amount in the Escrow Account held in the name of the Temporary Notes Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Concurrently with the closing of the Offering of the Temporary Notes, and after consummation of the Proposed Exchange Offers and Proposed Consent Solicitations and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, the Initial Purchasers deposited the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow Account which, together with the Pre-Funded Amount, comprised the Escrow Funds secured in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Temporary Notes. Following the completion of the Proposed Exchange Offers and the Proposed Consent Solicitations, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer exchanged 290.0 million aggregate principal amount of Temporary Notes for Senior Secured Notes.
