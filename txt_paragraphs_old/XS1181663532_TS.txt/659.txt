The taxable gain or deductible loss is calculated for each Note and is, in broad terms, equal to the sales price less the Norwegian Notes holders' cost price of the Note, including costs incurred in relation to the acquisition or realization of the Note. Any gain received in foreign currency when realizing Notes is converted to Norwegian kroner when calculating the taxable gain.
