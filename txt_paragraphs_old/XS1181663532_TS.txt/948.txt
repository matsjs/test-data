Emission Rights There is no accounting standard or interpretation in IFRS regarding the accounting treatment for emission allowances or renewable energy certificates. Received allowances are recognised in the balance sheet as intangible assets at the market value on the date the rights are granted. The difference between fair value and the nominal amount paid for the rights is recognised in the balance as a government grant (deferred income). Emissions are recognised in the income statement as Cost of materials, and the government grant (deferred revenue) is recognised concurrently with emission costs. Unused credits (deferred income) and used allowances are netted against the carrying amount of intangible asset recognised in the balance sheet, when the individual contracts for emission allowances fall due for settlement. If the received allowances are sufficient to cover the company's emissions, there will be no net cost or net income in gross operating earnings. If it is necessary to acquire additional allowances on the open market, a provision is made based on actual emissions. If the number of allowances received exceeds actual consumption, the surplus is sold in the market. The gain/loss from the sale is presented as Other gains and losses.
New and amended interpretations and standards adopted by the group The following standards are mandatory for the first time for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 (the new standards adopted by the group, has not had a significant impact on the financial statements):
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements IFRS 10 builds on the existing principles that define the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control. The standard has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2014. It has not had a significant impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements
IFRS 11 removes the option for jointly controlled entities to use proportionate consolidation. Instead, the equity method of accounting must be used. The standard specifies two main categories of joint control: joint ventures and joint operations. For joint ventures, joint control is recognised in accordance with the equity method, but for joint operations, the parties shall recognise their rights in the assets and liabilities included in the collaboration. The standard has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2014. It has not had a significant impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities
The standard contains disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint ventures, associated companies, special purpose entities and other off balance sheet entities. The standard has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2014. It has not had a significant impact on the financial statements.
