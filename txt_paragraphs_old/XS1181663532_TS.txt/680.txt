 super-priority claims (claims that arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidator's costs and obligations of the estate);
 tax claims (such as withholding tax and value-added tax within certain limitations);
 ordinary unsecured claims (all other claims unless subordinated, including unsecured debt, trade creditors and indemnity claims); and
 subordinated claims (including interest incurred after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, claims subordinated by agreement, liquidated damages and penalty claims).
Pursuant to the Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions carried out in the three to twelve month period (and, in respect of transactions in favor of related parties, up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings, such as extraordinary payments of certain creditors, security established for existing debt and transactions at an undervalue. The bankruptcy estate may also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently which in an improper manner increase the debtor's debt, favor one or more creditors at the expense of others or deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors' claims, in which case the time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to ten years.
Solvent enforcement
Enforcement of security normally requires that the pledgee or chargee files an application to the enforcement authorities for the enforcement of the security. Certain types of security may, however, be enforced without the involvement of the enforcement authority or a court, typically security established pursuant to the Financial Collateral Act and charges over monetary claims. A provision granting the secured party such right of enforcement is typically included in any security agreement between the pledgor/chargor and the secured party.
Enforcement of a guarantee claim against a solvent guarantor will in principal require a final, legally binding judgment by a court (unless the guarantee is made as an enforceable promissory note). Thereafter the creditor may apply to the enforcement authorities for enforcement of his or her claim against the assets of the guarantor.
