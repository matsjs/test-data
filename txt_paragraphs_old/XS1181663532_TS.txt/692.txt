Guarantees--liability to be set aside
A ``transaction'' for the purposes of the voidable transaction legislation is given a wide meaning and includes a guarantee given by a body. Under Australian law, a guarantee given by a company may also be set aside on a number of other grounds. For example, a guarantee may be unenforceable against a guarantor if the directors of the guarantor did not comply with their duties to act in good faith for the benefit of the guarantor and for a proper purpose in giving the guarantee. The issue is particularly relevant where a company provides a guarantee in relation to the obligations of another member of its corporate family, as is the case for the guarantees given by the Australian Guarantors with respect to the Notes. However, a director of a wholly-owned subsidiary is taken to act in good faith in the best interests of the subsidiary if the subsidiary's constitution expressly authorizes the director to act in the best interests of the holding company, the director acts in good faith in the best interests of the holding company and the subsidiary is not insolvent at the time the director acts and does not become insolvent because of the director's act.
In determining whether there is sufficient benefit, all relevant facts and circumstances of the transaction need to be considered by the directors, including the benefits and detriments to the Australian Guarantor in giving the guarantee, and the respective benefits to the other parties involved in the transaction.
Whether a guarantee entered into in breach of directors' duties can be avoided against a party relying on the guarantee depends on certain factors, including the state of knowledge of that party, and whether the party knew of or suspected the breach. Under Australian law, a person is entitled to assume that the directors have properly performed their duties to the company unless that person knows or suspects that the assumption is incorrect.
Voidable transactions--consequences for the Noteholders
With respect to the Australian Guarantors, Noteholders will need to be mindful of the following:
· the security granted to the Noteholders may be at risk of being subject to an order that the new security is a voidable transaction, should one or more of the Subsidiary Guarantors have an administrator or liquidator appointed to it within the relevant period(s) noted above following the grant of security for repayment of the Notes;
· if any of the guarantees from an Australian Guarantor is avoided, it is possible that Noteholders would be left with a claim solely against the Issuer and the other Subsidiary Guarantors and payments received from the relevant Australian Guarantor may need to be repaid; and
