In Australia and New Zealand, we are the only domestic producer of publication paper and currently provide 83% of newsprint and account for nearly 37% of the coated mechanical paper market in the region based on sales volume. We face competition from companies that import paper, mainly from newsprint producers in Korea and Indonesia and magazine producers in Japan and Europe. Given the structure of the Australian publishing market, with few, large players, the ability of any one supplier to dictate pricing is more limited than would otherwise be the case in the face of relatively limited supply.
