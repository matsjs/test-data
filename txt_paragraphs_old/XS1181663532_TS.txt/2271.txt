Restructuring provision
The restructuring provision of NOK 363 million at 31 Decem ber 2011 is classified in the balance sheet as current liabilities. In the fourth quarter of 2011, it was decided to shut down the paper production at Norske Skog Follum. Total provisions related to the closure were NOK 248 million at 31 Decem ber 2011, of which NOK 131 million related to severance payments and NOK 117 million was other expected costs related to the shut down of the operations and clearing of the site. Another material item was a provision of NOK 59 million related to a cost reduction programme at Norske Skog Walsum. For further information see Note 16 Restructuring expenses.
Dism antling provision
Provisions related to future dismantling costs arising from a future closing down of production facilities amounted to NOK 102 million at 31 Decem ber 2011, compared to NOK 92 million at 31 Decem ber 2010. The total amount is classified as non-current and will only be realised at the time of a future closing down of any of the Norske Skog production units. The provision is the net present value of the future estimated costs, calculated using a long-term risk-free interest rate. The periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised in the income statement under Financial items. The opposite entry for dismantling provision and change in provision estimates is Property, plant and equipment.
Discount rates and assumptions included as part of the best estimate will impact the future carrying value of the dismantling provision. To illustrate the sensitivity, a reduction in the future discount rate of one percent point would increase the provision by approximately NOK 10 million, with a corresponding increase in future depreciation on property, plant and equipment.
