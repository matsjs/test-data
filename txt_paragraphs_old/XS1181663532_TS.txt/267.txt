All amounts presented in the table above are notional amounts. Total interest-bearing liabilities will therefore differ from booked total amounts due to bond discount/premiums, hedge reserve and unrealized effects of fair value hedging. Floating rate exposure is calculated without accounting for potential future refinancing.
