Equalization of the Senior Secured Creditors
The Intercreditor Agreement generally provides that if, for any reason, any Senior Liabilities remain unpaid after the relevant enforcement date and the resulting losses are not borne by the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors in the proportions which their respective exposures at the enforcement date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors at the relevant enforcement date (or, in the case of Recoveries resulting from the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the Transaction Security or a transaction in lieu thereof, in a manner reflecting the order of priority contemplated under the caption ` `-- A p p lic a tio n o f P ro c e e d s -- O rd e r o f A p p lic a tio n " ), the Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors (subject, in the case of amounts owing to the applicable trustee, to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) will make such payments among themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions (or, as the case may be, to otherwise reflect the order of priority contemplated under the caption `-- A p p lic a tio n o f P r o c e e d s -- O r d e r o f A p p lic a tio n " ).
Debt Refinancing
The Intercreditor Agreement permits any of the liabilities under certain of the Debt Documents to be refinanced, replaced, exchanged, extended, supplemented, increased or otherwise restructured in whole or in part from time to time including by way of Permitted Super Senior Financing Debt, Permitted Senior Financing Debt and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt or the issue of additional Senior Secured Notes and/or Senior Notes) (each a ``Debt Refinancing''). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment to or replacement of the then current Secured Debt Documents and/or take such other action as is required by the Parent in order to facilitate such a Debt Refinancing, including changes to, the taking of, or release and retake of, any guarantee or security, subject to certain conditions. At the option of the Parent, a Debt Refinancing may be made available on a basis which is senior to, p a r i p a s s u with or junior to any of the other liabilities, shall be entitled to benefit from all or any of the Transaction Security, may be made available on a secured or unsecured basis (subject to certain restrictions) and may be effected in whole or in part by way of a debt exchange, non-cash rollover or other similar or equivalent transaction, in each case unless otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing Agreements. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, each agent, each Secured Party and each Primary Creditor agrees that it shall co-operate with the Parent, each other member of the Group and each Agent in order to facilitate any Debt Refinancing (including by way of, at the request and cost of the Parent, executing any document or agreement and/or giving instructions to any person).
Required Consents
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, it and/or a security document may be amended or waived only with the written consent of:
(i) if any Permitted Super Senior Financing Debt has been incurred and the relevant amendment or waiver (the ``Proposed Amendment'') is prohibited by the terms of the relevant Permitted Super Senior Financing Agreement, the Super Senior Creditor Representative in respect of that Permitted Super Senior Financing Debt (if applicable, acting on the instructions of the Majority Permitted Super Senior Financing Creditors)
