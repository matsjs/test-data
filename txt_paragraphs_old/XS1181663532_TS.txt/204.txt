M a g a z in e P a p e r. Operating revenue from our Magazine Paper segment in 2013 decreased by 20.2% to NOK 4,992 million, compared to NOK 6,254 million in 2012. Total volume of magazine paper sold by us in 2013 decreased by approximately 20.2% to 1,049,000 tons, compared to 1,308,000 tons in 2012. The decrease in operating revenue was primarily due to the sale of our Parenco facilities in the Netherlands and the closure of the Follum mill. Demand for magazine paper in Europe declined broadly with a 0.6% decrease in demand for uncoated mechanical paper and a demand decline of 6.4% for coated mechanical paper. Sales prices (measured in Euro) for magazine paper in Europe decreased slightly in 2013 compared to 2012, based on prices in Germany established by RISI.
