Provisions are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised within Financial items.
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivables for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the group's activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the group. The group's revenue consists almost exclusively of the sale of goods, and the principle for recognition of revenue is the same for newsprint and magazine paper.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer. This will depend upon the buyer's delivery terms and will be in the range from the finalisation of the production to delivery of the goods to the buyer.
The group's terms of delivery are based on Incoterms 2010, which are the official rules for the interpretation of trade terms issued by the International Cham ber of Commerce. The timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on these delivery terms. The group's sales are covered by the following main categories of terms:
· ``D'' terms, where the group delivers the goods to the purchaser at the agreed destination, usually the purchaser's premises. The point of sale is when the goods are delivered to the purchaser. If the customer is invoiced before delivery of the goods purchased, revenue is only recognised if the customer has taken over a significant part of the gain and loss potential related to those goods.
· ``C '' terms, where the group arranges and pays for the external transport of the goods, but the group no longer bears any responsibility for the goods once they have been handed over to the transporter in accordance with the terms of the contract. The point of sale is when the goods are handed over to the transporter contracted by the seller.
· ``F'' terms, where the purchaser arranges and pays for the transport. The point of sale is when the goods are handed over to the transporter contracted by the purchaser.
