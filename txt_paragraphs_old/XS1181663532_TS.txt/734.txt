In the event of insolvency of a guarantor or a provider of collateral organized under the laws of Germany and/or having its centre of main interests in Germany (the ``German Providers'') any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law.
The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.
Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court e x o ffic io , but require that the debtor (In s o lv e n z s c h u ld n e r) and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (A n tra g a u f E r o ffn u n g d e s In s o lv e n z v e rfa h re n s ). Insolvency proceedings under German law with respect to a debtor incorporated or established as a German limited liability company (G e s e lls c h a ft m it b e s c h ro n k te r H a ftu n g ), a German stock corporation (A k tie n g e s e lls c h a ft) a European law stock corporation (S o c ie ta s E u ro p a e a , or SE) or any other corporation or partnership not having an individual as a personally liable shareholder, can be initiated by

either the debtor or the creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (U b e rs c h u ld u n g ) or illiquidity (Z a h lu n g s u n fa h ig k e it) of the debtor. A debtor is illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due. A debtor is considered over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets unless a continuation of the business is predominantly likely. Whether the debtor's liabilities exceed the value of its assets must be assessed on the basis of an over-indebtedness balance sheet to be drawn up on the basis of the liquidation values. The continuation of the business is predominantly likely if -- as a decision to be taken by the company's management at its own discretion -- it is more likely than not (>50%) that within, as a rule of thumb, the current and the subsequent financial year, the company will be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due. If a German limited liability company, a German stock corporation (A k tie n g e s e lls c h a ft), a European law stock corporation (S o c ie ta s E u ro p a e a , or S E ), any other limited liability company or any company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management of such company is obliged to file for insolvency without undue delay (o h n e s c h u ld h a fte s Z o g e rn ), however, at the latest within 21 days after illiquidity or over-indebtedness have occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, the debtor is entitled, but not obliged, to file for insolvency proceedings if it unlikely to be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due in the future ( d ro h e n d e Z a h lu n g s u n fa h ig k e it).
If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted but not yet illiquid it may also file for preliminary ``debtor-in-possession'' moratorium proceedings (``S c h u tz s c h irm v e rfa h re n " ) unless -- from a third party perspective -- there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (v o rla u fig e r S a c h w a lte r) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). The court may also resolve other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which ideally will be implemented in ``debtor-in-possession'' proceedings (E ig e n v e rw a ltu n g ) after main insolvency proceedings have been opened.
The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition (whether it aims for debtor-in-possession moratorium proceedings as outlined above or at ordinary insolvency proceedings), the insolvency court may and usually take preliminary measures to secure the insolvency estate (In s o lv e n z m a s s e ) during the preliminary proceedings (In s o lv e n z e ro ffn u n g s v e rfa h re n ). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor's assets other than immovable assets during these preliminary proceedings and will, in almost all cases, appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (v o rla u fig e r In s o lv e n z v e rw a lte r), unless the debtor has applied for so-called ``debtor-in-possession'' proceedings (E ig e n v e rw a ltu n g ) in which event the court will only appoint a preliminary trustee (v o rla u fig e r S a c h w a lte r) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. The duty of the preliminary administrator is, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the insolvency estate (In s o lv e n z m a s s e ), to verify the existence of a reason for the opening of insolvency proceedings (In s o lv e n z e ro ffn u n g s g ru n d ) and to assess whether the debtor's net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings.
During preliminary insolvency proceedings a ``preliminary creditors' committee'' (v o rla u fig e r G la u b ig e ra u s s c h u s s ) can be appointed by the court if the debtor satisfies two of the following three requirements (in the financial year prior to the insolvency filing): a balance sheet total in excess of 4,840,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted), revenues of at least 9,680,000 in the 12 months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing and/or fifty or more employees in the yearly average. The requirements apply to the respective entity without taking into account the assets of other group companies. The preliminary creditors' committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator ( v o rla u fig e r In s o lv e n z v e rw a lte r) or an insolvency administrator (In s o lv e n z v e rw a lte r), orders for ``debtor-in-possession'' proceedings (A n o rd n u n g d e r E ig e n v e rw a ltu n g ), and the appointment of a preliminary trustee ( v o rla u fig e r S a c h w a lte r).
The court orders the opening (E ro a ffn u n g s b e s c h lu s s ) of formal insolvency proceedings (eroaffnetes In s o lv e n z v e rfa h re n ) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there is a reason for the opening of insolvency proceedings (i.e. over-indebtedness and/or (pending) illiquidity) and if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third
