· ranked pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness (other than senior indebtedness) of that Subsidiary Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee;
· effectively subordinated to any existing or future secured indebtedness (including the Senior Secured Notes) or obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness.
In addition, no enforcement action with respect to the Guarantees (or any future Guarantee of the Exchange Notes, if any) may be taken unless (subject to certain limited exceptions): (i) any enforcement action has been taken with respect to senior debt (provided the Trustee and Holders of the Exchange Notes will be limited to taking the same action); (ii) an insolvency event has occurred in relation to the Issuer; (iii) with respect to any enforcement action on a Subsidiary Guarantor, an insolvency event has occurred with respect to the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor; (iv) there is a default on the Exchange Notes outstanding after a period of 179 days after the date on which the Security Agent or Senior Secured Notes Trustee with respect to senior debt delivers written notice of such default; (v) the expiry of any other standstill period outstanding at the date the standstill period referred to in (iv) above commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy); (vi) a default has occurred resulting from a failure to pay principal on the Exchange Notes at maturity or (vii) the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes have given their consent to the proposed action. See ``Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement" .
Upon any distribution to the creditors of a Subsidiary Guarantor in a liquidation, administration, bankruptcy, moratorium of payments, dissolution or other winding-up of such Subsidiary Guarantor, the Holders of senior debt of such Subsidiary Guarantors will be entitled to be paid in full before any payment may be made with respect to its Guarantee. As a result, Holders of the Exchange Notes may receive less, ratably, than the Holders of senior debt of the Subsidiary Guarantors, including the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes, and may not receive payment in respect of the Guarantees.
A Guarantee will terminate and be released upon, among other things, the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the relevant Guarantor, the designation of such Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary, the legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction or discharge of the Exchange Notes and in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. See ``Description of the Exchange Notes--Note Guarantees--Note Guarantees Release" .

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement contains significant restrictions with respect to payments of the Exchange Notes, including payments by the Issuer. If there is a payment default under the Senior Secured Notes, or if a senior payment stop notice is issued following an non-payment event of default under the Senior Secured Notes, then payments will not be permitted to be made in respect of the Exchange Notes unless the payment is made by the Issuer and funded directly or indirectly with amounts which have not been received by the Issuer from its subsidiaries.
In some circumstances, for instance where payments were received on the Exchange Notes in breach of the Intercreditor Agreement, Holders would be required to turn over such payments to the Security Agent for redistribution. In addition, although the Holders of the Exchange Notes are generally entitled to enforce their claims against the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Notes Indenture, nevertheless the Intercreditor Agreement places limits on enforcement to the extent it would prejudice the enforcement by senior creditors of their security granted by the Issuer. See ``Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement" .
As of September 30, 2014, after giving effect to the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations and assuming 100% participation therein, we would have had an aggregate principal amount of outstanding financial liabilities (excluding derivative liabilities) that ranked senior to the Guarantees of 260 million.
