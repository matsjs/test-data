Energy constitutes our largest operating expense, and we are focused on reducing energy consumption. Energy accounted for 21% of our total operating expenses as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Of the amount spent on energy, 53% was related to electricity expenses. Approximately 85% of our electricity consumption is purchased under long-term contracts for fixed volumes and price expiring in 2020, which were entered into in Norway, France, Australia and New Zealand. We are constantly working on different energy saving programs, including optimization of steam supply, whereby less steam is used for making electricity when the price of purchasing electricity is low. This strategy also reduces the use of natural gas and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment. Several of our business units have also changed their operational patterns to exploit 24-hour fluctuations in electricity prices. In addition to reducing our energy consumption, we have reduced our exposure to fluctuations in energy prices by entering into long-term supply contracts. See

In Norway, long-term contracts with fixed volumes and price expiring in 2020 cover most of the energy consumption of our Skogn and Saugbrugs mills. Along with other members of an industrial consortium, we signed a long-term electricity contract in 2010, which expires in 2030, covering about one-third of Golbey's energy consumption. The remaining energy demand of Golbey is covered by energy purchases via a French regulated tariff structure called ARENH. Our operation in Bruck in Austria owns a natural gas-fired co-generation plant, which gives us an arbitrage opportunity between gas and electricity prices. Our operations in Germany are set up in a way that enables us to take advantage of the sometimes large spread between day and night electricity prices. Our exposure to spot prices in electricity and gas is mainly in continental Europe.
