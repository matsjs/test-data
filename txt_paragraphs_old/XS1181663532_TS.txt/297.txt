Raw Materials and Other Key Inputs
Energy (including electricity)
Energy is a key input for the paper and packaging industry. In addition to providing energy to run paper machines, a significant amount of energy is used in the mechanical pulp process where wood is chipped in large grinders that are run by electronic motors. Steam is also used in the thermo-mechanical pulp process, which is generated from other processes that also require the use of energy.
Pulp
Pulp for paper making can be either mechanically or chemically produced. Mechanical pulp is manufactured by grinding wood usually at site using electricity and steam. Chemical pulp, which is often purchased on the open market, is manufactured using a chemical process where fibers are separated from lignin and other wood residuals. The majority of our pulp is mechanical and is manufactured rather than purchased from the market.
Chemical pulp prices have followed an upward trend since the end of 2002. After steep declines in the price of chemical pulp from 2008 to 2011, prices increased from 2012 to the first half of 2014. Because we use mostly mechanical pulp in our operations, and given recent closures of certain mills that used chemical pulp, our exposure to such price changes in minimal.
Recovered Paper
In addition to pulp, another important source of fiber for the paper industry is recovered paper. Recovered paper is primarily used in the production of newsprint, containerboard and paperboard as a cheaper alternate to virgin fiber. Two of the larger sources of recovered paper are recycled corrugated containers and newspapers. Recovered paper prices have remained largely stable since 2012, within a price range of 120 - 125 per ton.
