New standards, interpretations and am endm ents to existing standards Listed below are new standards, interpretations and changes to published standards that are not yet mandatory, and for which early adoption is permitted. These have not been early adopted in 2011:
Items in the statement of comprehensive income that will be reclassified to profit or loss at a future point in time must be presented separately from items that will never be reclassified. The am endm ent is effective for annual periods beginning 1 July 2012 or later, but has not yet been approved by the EU.
IA S 19 E m p lo y e e b en efits (a m e n d m e n t)
The change means that all actuarial gains and losses shall be recognised in other comprehensive income as they occur (i.e. elimination of the corridor approach), all past service costs shall be recognised immediately, and that interest cost and expected return on plan assets shall be replaced with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability (asset). The am endm ent is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2013 or later, but has not yet been approved by the EU.
IA S 2 7 S e p a ra te fin a n c ia l statem en ts (revised)
The rules for consolidated financial statements are replaced by the new IFRS 10 and IFRS 12. What remains of IAS 27 is limited to accounting for subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates in separate financial statements. The changes are effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2013 or later, but have not yet been approved by the EU. The changes are not expected to have a significant impact on the separate financial statements.
