The Exchange Notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount (``OID'') for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Exchange Notes are treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. investors in the Exchange Notes will be subject to tax on OID (as ordinary income) as it accrues, in advance of the cash attributable to that income (and in addition to stated interest).
