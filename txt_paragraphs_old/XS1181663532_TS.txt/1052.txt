The presentational currency of the Norske Skog group is NOK. Currency translation risk arises when the financial statements of subsidiaries, presented in local currencies, are translated into NOK. In order to reduce translation risk, assets and liabilities are allocated to the same currency. In addition to traditional debt instruments, all combined currency and interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts are also used for hedging net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Cumulative currency translation differences of NOK 1 million were reclassified from equity to the income statement in 2014 as a result of the divestments of Norske Skog Polska Sp. z.o.o. and Norske Skog Czech & Slovak Republic spol. s.r.o.. Cumulative currency translation differences of NOK 39 million were reclassified from equity to the income statement in 2013 as a result of the divestments of Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. in Brazil and Norske Skog (Thailand) Co. Ltd.
