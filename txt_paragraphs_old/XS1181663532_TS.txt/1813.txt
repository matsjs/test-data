Moreover, Norske Skog monitors and manages financial risk based on internal policies and standards set forth by corporate management and approved by the board of directors. These written policies provide principles for the overall risk management as well as standards for managing currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments. Compliance with policies and standards is continuously monitored. There were no breaches of these policies during 2012 or 2011.
a) Interest rate risk
The goal of interest rate risk management is to secure the lowest possible interest rate payments over time within acceptable risk limits. In the current challenging situation in the publication paper market, Norske Skog has secured most of the interest rate payments by primarily paying fixed interest rates on its loan obligations.
