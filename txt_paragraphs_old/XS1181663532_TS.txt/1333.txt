Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consists primarily of physical energy contracts. The fair value of commodity contracts is particularly sensitive to future fluctuations in energy prices. The fair value of embedded derivatives in physical contracts depends on currency and price index fluctuations.
Higher energy prices have a positive impact on fair value. Energy prices in New Zealand are virtually unchanged compared with the previous quarter.
The energy contracts in Norway are nominated in EUR. These contracts contain embedded derivatives that are recognised at fair value in accordance with IAS 39 F in a n c ia l in s tru m e n ts -- re c o g n itio n a n d m e a s u re m e n t. NOK has strengthened against EUR during the quarter, which has had a positive effect on the fair value of the embedded derivatives.
A decrease in estimates of consumer price indices has a positive impact on fair value. Consumer price indices, which affect the fair value, show only small changes compared with the previous quarter.
Changes in the value of energy-/commodity contracts and embedded derivatives in contracts are presented in the income statement line Other gains and losses. Realised effects from financial energy contracts are also included in this accounting line.
Gains and losses on level 3 financial instruments recognised in the income statement, line item Other gains and losses, amounted to NOK 96 million in the third quarter (NOK - 2 7 million in the second quarter).
