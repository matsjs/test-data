Our operations in Australasia generally sell their newsprint products to newspaper publishers and commercial printers of preprint advertising, whose products are inserted into newspapers or delivered by other means. The principal markets for our Australasian newsprint are Australia and New Zealand, with approximately 30% of our Australasian production exported to the Pacific Islands and other Asian markets. Our magazine products from Boyer are generally sold to major catalogue, insert and flyer printers, more than 85% of which are delivered in Australia.
Our publication paper in Australia and New Zealand is sold directly to our customers by our Australasian sales force. With effect from the second half of 2013, we entered into new contracts with durations of seven years with our two largest customers, News Limited and Fairfax Media Limited. Both long-term contracts provide for annual price adjustment in the first two to five years, while the remaining period is determined with reference to U.S. dollar pricing of the relevant publication paper product. In 2014, approximately 55% of our Australasian deliveries were covered by these long-term newsprint agreements. The magazine contracts are mainly negotiated every three months with the Australian catalogue and advertising customers.
