The group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. See Note 9 for more information.
f) P e n s io n s
The present value of the pension obligation depends on several input factors that are determined by means of a number of actuarial assumptions. The assumptions used in calculating the net pension expense (income) includes the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will affect the carrying value of the pension obligation.
New and am ended interpretations and standards adopted by the group The group has adopted the following new and am ended IFRSs in 2011:
IA S 1 P re se n ta tio n o f fin a n c ia l statem en ts (a m e n d m e n t)
The change means that it is no longer required to show all items that are included in comprehensive income in the statement of changes in group equity. These may instead appear as a single sum. The group has previously presented the statement of changes in equity in accordance with the am ended standard, and the change has therefore not affected the presentation in the financial statements.
