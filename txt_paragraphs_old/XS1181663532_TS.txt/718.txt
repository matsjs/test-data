In the event of a breach of the agreement, any party to the agreement can petition the court for its termination. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims and Security Interests, except amounts already paid to them.

Court-administered proceedings may be initiated:
· in the event of safeguard proceedings, upon petition by the debtor only (for accelerated safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below); and
· in the event of judicial reorganization or liquidation, upon petition by the debtor, any creditor or the public prosecutor.
O p en ing
The debtor may file for safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings at any time it is facing difficulties that it cannot overcome. Regular safeguard proceedings can only be opened, if the debtor is not insolvent (e n e ta t d e c e s s a tio n d e s p a ie m e n ts ) whereas accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings may be opened as long as it was not insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of conciliation.
It is required to petition for the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings (if recovery is possible) or judicial liquidation proceedings (if recovery is manifestly not possible) within 45 days of the date upon which the insolvency (date de cessation des paiements) occurred. If it fails to do so (or if it fails to file for conciliation alternatively), its directors and officers may be subject to civil liability. Creditors of the company do not attend the hearing before the court at which the opening of safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is requested. The same applies for the hearing before the court at which the opening of reorganization or liquidation proceedings is requested, save for the creditor having requested it, as the case may be.
