Non-current assets held for sale
Norske Skog did not have any non-current assets held for sale at 31 December 2014.
Assumptions applied when calculating the recoverable amount
PPE and intangible non-current assets are written down to their recoverable amount when this is lower than the carrying value of the asset. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from an asset or cash-generating unit. Norske Skog applies the value in use approach when calculating recoverable amount for its cash-generating units.
