Total financial items amounted to a loss of NOK 117 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to a loss of NOK 629 million for the year ended December 31,2011. The decrease in loss is primarily due to the effects of the appreciation of the Norwegian kroner against other major currencies in 2012 on the value of debt denominated in such non-NOK currencies. Other financial income in both 2011 and 2012 reflects the gain on purchases of our debt securities.
Income taxes
We recognized a tax income of NOK 69 million in 2012 compared to a tax income of NOK 588 million in 2011. The reduced income taxes were primarily due to reduced loss before income tax, an increase in tax losses not recognized and reduced recognition of tax assets in 2012.
Net profit/loss Net loss for the year was NOK 2,781 million in 2012 compared to a net loss of NOK 2,545 million in 2011.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity risk management
We are exposed to liquidity risk in a scenario where our cash flow from operating activities is not sufficient to cover payments of financial liabilities. In order to effectively mitigate liquidity risk, our risk management strategy focuses on maintaining sufficient cash and securing available financing through committed credit facilities. Managing liquidity risk is centralized on a Group level.
