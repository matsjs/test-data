France
A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (e x e q u a tu r) in France before the relevant civil court (T rib u n a l d e G ra n d e In s ta n c e ) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter.
Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment):
 such U.S. judgment was issued by a court that had jurisdiction over the case;
 such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules (o rd re p u b lic in te rn a tio n a l), both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights;
 such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law (i.e., the parties did not submit the dispute to a foreign court in order to maliciously avoid the application of French law);
 such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France; and
 in addition, please note that a clear position has not yet been established in French case law as to whether proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the foreign judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as this judgment may have an impact on enforcement in France of the foreign judgment.
