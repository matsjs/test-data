2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
The group's terms of delivery are based on Incoterms 2010, which are the official rules for the interpretation of trade terms issued by the International Chamber of Commerce. The timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on these delivery terms. The group's sales are covered by the following main categories of terms:
· ``D'' terms, where the group delivers the goods to the purchaser at the agreed destination, usually the purchaser's premises. The point of sale is when the goods are delivered to the purchaser. If the customer is invoiced before delivery of the goods purchased, revenue is only recognised if the customer has taken over a significant part of the gain and loss potential related to those goods,
· ``C'' terms, where the group arranges and pays for the external transport of the goods, but the group no longer bears any responsibility for the goods once they have been handed over to the transporter in accordance with the terms of the contract. The point of sale is when the goods are handed over to the transporter contracted by the seller,
· ``F'' terms, where the purchaser arranges and pays for the transport. The point of sale is when the goods are handed over to the transporter contracted by the purchaser.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. This is the interest rate that gives a net present value of the cash flow from the loan that is equal to its carrying value.
