A violation of Austrian capital maintenance rules by an Austrian Guarantor would result in the invalidity of the relevant transaction between the Austrian Guarantor and the shareholder (or between the Austrian Guarantor and a third party if the transaction has been undertaken by an Austrian Guarantor for the benefit of its shareholder e.g. by providing an upstream or cross stream guarantee for the financing to the parent company).
Irrespective of considerations of Austrian capital maintenance rules, the recoverability under certain Guarantees granted by the Australian Guarantor may be limited owing to the subordination and other factors.

The Austrian Act on Equity Replacements (Federal Law Gazette No. 92/2003 as last amended by Federal Law Gazette No. 58/2010; E ig e n k a p ita le rs a tz g e s e tz ) contains detailed provisions regarding specific circumstances in which shareholder loans are considered as company equity. In particular, loans granted by a shareholder in a financial crisis (i.e. the subsidiary is insolvent, over-indebted or the requirements of a business reorganization procedure are met) are deemed to be equity replacing. In a financial crisis, equity replacing shareholder loans may not be repaid and any security interest granted in connection with such loans may not be enforced. This means that in insolvency proceedings, respective claims are subordinated (i.e. there is no right for separation (A u s s o n d e ru n g s re c h t) or a right for separate satisfaction (A b s o n d e ru n g s re c h t)). A shareholder is, according to the Austrian Act on Equity Replacements, (i) a shareholder with controlling participation, (ii) a shareholder with a participation of at least 25%, and (iii) any person not holding a participation in the company but having a controlling influence ( b e h e rr s c h e n d e r E in flu s s ).
Furthermore, a person granting a loan/credit to a company is to be considered as shareholder if (i) it holds participation or other rights in a third person which has a controlling influence regarding the company granted the loan/credit, (ii) it indirectly holds at least 33% of the participation rights in the company granted the loan/credit or (iii) it holds controlling direct or indirect participation rights in a company which holds at least 25% of the participation rights in the company granted the loan/credit.
Prior to the enactment of the Act on Equity Replacements the Austrian Supreme Court had developed even stricter rules on equity replacing shareholder loans compared to the rules stipulated in the Austrian Act on Equity Replacements. In this context, it is uncertain whether the rules on equity replacing shareholder loans also apply to (controlling) atypical pledgees (a ty p is c h e P fa n d g la u b ig e r) and/or under what specific circumstances a secured lender may qualify as atypical pledgee.
