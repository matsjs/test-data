Taxes on income and capital gains
Non-Resident holders of Temporary Notes
Non-resident holders of Temporary Notes, not having a permanent establishment, a permanent representative, or a fixed place of business in Luxembourg to which the Temporary Notes or income therefrom are attributable, are not subject to Luxembourg income taxes on income accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Temporary Notes nor on capital gains realised on the disposal or redemption of the Temporary Notes.
Non-resident holders who have a permanent establishment, a permanent representative, or a fixed place of business in Luxembourg to which the Temporary Notes are allocable, are subject to Luxembourg corporate income tax and municipal business tax on interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts and on any gains realised upon the sale or disposal of the Temporary Notes.

If held in the context of carrying on an enterprise, any interest income, whether paid or accrued, and any capital gain or foreign exchange result whether realised or accrued, derived from the Temporary Notes is subject to Luxembourg income taxes (income tax levied at progressive rates and municipal business tax). The 10% withholding tax levied is credited against their final tax liability.
If held in the context of managing private wealth, interest income received is subject to income tax at progressive rates unless the 10% withholding tax or the 10% tax applied. Furthermore, capital gains realised upon disposal of Temporary Notes are taxable if realised within six months from their acquisition or if their disposal precedes the acquisition of the Temporary Notes. Upon redemption of the Temporary Notes, Luxembourg resident individuals must include the portion of the redemption price corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest in their taxable income, unless the 10% withholding tax or the 10% tax has been levied.
