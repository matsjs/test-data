Uncoated mechanical paper
In 2013, Western European SC paper capacity declined by a record 6.3%. A total of 325,000 tons of capacity reductions were driven by three closures. In contrast, other uncoated mechanical paper capacity (which includes Uncoated Mechanical Improved (``UMI'') and Uncoated Mechanical Others (``UMO''), as defined by PPPC) rose marginally, as a 150,000 ton increase in the UMI category was almost completely offset by a 125,000 ton drop in the UMO segment. Recently, UPM announced its intention to permanently close down a paper mill in Finland in the first quarter of 2015 with 235,000 tons of uncoated mechanical paper capacity, corresponding to 3.1% of Western European uncoated mechanical capacity compared to year-end 2013 capacity.
