We expect our past investments, when coupled with our renewed focus on key customer geographies, in Europe, where our customers are concentrated in the region's four largest economies, and in Australasia, where we are the leading producer, will enable us to benefit from anticipated improvements in the market for our products. In particular, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from any future declines in aggregate publication paper production capacity, any future increases in publication paper prices and any future improvements in publication paper mill utilization rates.
