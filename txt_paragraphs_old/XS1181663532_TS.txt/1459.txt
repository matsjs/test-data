Expected useful life
Norske Skog has conducted sensitivity analyses with respect to changes in expected useful life of the group's paper machines. If the expected useful life of all the group's paper machines is reduced by one year, the annual depreciation charge will increase by around NOK 100 million.
In connection with the year-end closing process for 2013, Norske Skog performed a review of the expected remaining useful lives of PPE. No changes in useful life will be made in 2014 compared to those applied in 2013. Due to the fact that the level of depreciation in 2013 exceeded purchases of PPE, the future annual depreciation amount is expected to decrease.
