Coated mechanical paper
Global coated mechanical paper capacity (adjusted for idled machines) has declined at an average annual rate of 4.1% per year from 2008 to 2013. In 2013, the decline was 4.3% as compared to 2012, largely driven by a 7.1% reduction in North American capacity and a 3.8% reduction in Western Europe capacity. During 2014, Stora Enso closed two machines with an aggregate capacity of 520,000 tons. Furthermore, UPM recently announced its intention to permanently close down a paper mill in Finland in the first quarter of 2015, which will remove an additional 225,000 tons of coated mechanical paper capacity from the market. The combined impact of Stora Enso's closures and UPM's announced closure correspond to a 8.7% reduction of Western European capacity compared to year-end 2013 capacity. In contrast, the conversion of one of our machines at our Boyer mill in Australasia from newsprint to coated mechanical paper in the second quarter of 2014 increased annual capacity by 140,000 tons. The Boyer mill is the only producer of coated mechanical paper in the region.
