The carrying value of the provision is the best estimate made by measuring the expected value of the specific obligations, discounted to present value using a long-term risk-free interest rate when the time value of money is material. Changes in factors included in the expected value will impact the carrying value of the obligation. To illustrate the sensitivity, a reduction in the future discount rate by one percentage point would increase the provision by approximately NOK 27 million. Changes in accounting estimates not related to assets are classified as operating items in the income statement, and the periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised within Financial items.
