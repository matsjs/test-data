The losses from divestment of business activities, property, plant and equipment of NOK 178 million in 2013 related primarily to losses of NOK 218 million incurred in the divestment of the Pisa operations in Brazil, which were partly offset by gains of NOK 49 million from the sale of the Singburi operations in Thailand and adjustments for the reclassification of certain of these losses and gains upon the loss of control of these companies. We also recognized a gain of NOK 23 million from the sale of non-production related property, which further offset these losses. We also included a loss of NOK 26 million in relation to input VAT on transaction costs incurred upon the divestments of mills in South Korea and China in previous years.
Impairments
We recognized no impairment charges in 2013 compared to NOK 2,086 million in 2012. The 2012 impairment charges related primarily to the revaluation of our operations at our Tasman and Walsum facilities following the decision to close one newsprint machine at our Tasman facility and the closure of one magazine paper machine at our Walsum facility.
Operating earnings
We recognized operating earnings of negative NOK 1,111 million in 2013 compared to operating earnings of negative NOK 2,663 million in 2012. The primary reason for the decrease in losses in 2013 compared to 2012 was the impact of significant impairment charges recognized in 2012.
