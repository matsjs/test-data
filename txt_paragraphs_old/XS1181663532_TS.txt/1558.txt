Total debt listed in the repayment schedule may differ from booked debt. This is due to premiums or discounts on issued bonds, hedge reserves and fair value of hedging. At 31 Decem ber 2013, the financial statements included a discount of NOK 86 million (discount of NOK 85 million at 31 Decem ber 2012). Premiums or discounts on issued bonds are amortised in the income statement over the lifetime of the issued bonds. See Note 6 for loans secured by mortgage.
NET INTEREST-BEARING DEBT
As a result of the termination of a large part of the fair value hedge portfolio in the beginning of 2009, an amount was reclassified in the balance sheet. A hedge reserve (deferred income) amounting to NOK 185 million is included in interest-bearing debt as at 31 Decem ber 2013 (NOK 196 million at 31 Decem ber 2012). The hedge reserve does not constitute any payment obligation for the group, but will be amortised in the income statement over the term of the debt that has been hedged (i.e. until 2033).
At 31 Decem ber 2013, the group's holding of own bonds amounted to NOK 170 million of Norwegian bonds (NOK 163 million at 31 Decem ber 2012). The group's holding of own bonds in foreign currency amounted to USD 42 million and EUR 132 million at 31 Decem ber 2013 (USD 42 million and EUR 132 million at 31 Decem ber 2012). These holdings are deducted from interest-bearing debt in NOK.
