(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders, cash in euros, non-callable Euro Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euros and non-callable Euro Government Obligations, in amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee or such entity for cancellation for principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;
(2) the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and
(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be.
In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied; p ro v id e d that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).
Judgment Currency
Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in euros which is made to or for the account of any holder or the Trustee in lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the ``Judgment Currency''), whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the liquidation of the Issuer or any Guarantor, shall constitute a discharge of the Issuer or the Guarantor's obligation under the Indenture and the Notes or Note Guarantee, as the case may be, only to the extent of the amount of euros with such holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, could purchase in the London foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Judgment Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first Business Day following receipt of the payment in the Judgment Currency. If the amount of euros that could be so purchased is less than the amount of euros originally due to such holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall indemnify and hold harmless the holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, from and against all loss or damage arising out of, or as a result of, such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in the Indenture or the Notes, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any holder or the Trustee from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.
Concerning the Trustee
The Issuer shall deliver written notice to the Trustee within 30 days of becoming aware of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in transactions with the Issuer and any Guarantor; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee.
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.
