In te re s t rate s e n s itiv ity analysis
In accordance with IFRS 7 F in a n c ia l in s tru m e n ts --d is c lo s u re s , an interest rate sensitivity analysis is presented showing the effects of changes in market interest rates on interest costs and interest income, as well as equity where applicable. The analysis is based on the following assumptions:
· Floating rate debt is exposed to changes in market interest rates, i.e. the interest costs or interest income associated with such instruments will fluctuate based on changes in market rates. These changes are accounted for in the sensitivity analysis. The result is based on the assumption that all other factors are kept constant.
· Changes in market rates on fixed rate debt will only affect the income statement if they are measured at fair value. Thus, fixed rate instruments recognised at amortised cost will not represent an interest rate risk as defined by IFRS 7. Such instruments will therefore not have any influence on the sensitivity analysis.
