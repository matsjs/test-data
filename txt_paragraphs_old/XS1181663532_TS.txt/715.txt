Under French law, a company is considered to be insolvent (e n e ta t d e c e s s a tio n d e s p a ie m e n ts ) when it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with its available assets taking into account available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.
A French company facing difficulties without being cash flow insolvent (or for less than 45 days in the case of conciliation proceedings) may request the opening of court-assisted proceedings (m a n d a t a d h o c or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor's main creditors and stakeholders e.g. agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness. These proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor company itself, in its sole discretion. M a n d a t a d h o c and conciliation are informal and confidential (subject to the below) proceedings carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (m a n d a ta ire a d h o c or c o n c ilia te u r, whose name can be suggested by the debtor) itself under the supervision of the President of the relevant court (usually the Commercial Court), which do not involve any stay of the claims nor pending proceedings. As a consequence, creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the company to recover their claims, but, in practice, they usually accept to do so for the duration of the proceedings. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period (in conciliation proceedings the President of the court), as set forth above and below. In conciliation proceedings, the decision would be taken after having heard the conciliator (Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code).
M a n d a t a d h o c and conciliation proceedings may also be used at the request of the debtor and after the opinion of the participating creditors has been sought to prepare the sale of all or part of the business of the debtor with a view to implement such sale (p la n d e c e s s io n ) in a subsequent insolvency proceeding. To ensure transparency, the public prosecutor must be consulted on any offer formalized in the context of such conciliation proceeding.
Contractual provisions modifying the terms of an outstanding contract, by diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely by reason of the appointment of a m a n d a ta ire a d h o c or the opening of conciliation proceedings, or any request made to this end are deemed null and void.
Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result of the opening of a m a n d a t a d h o c proceedings or the opening of conciliation proceedings, make the debtor bear the fees of the creditor's counsel relating to such proceedings for the portion that would exceed three quarters of the total fee of the relevant counsel are null and void.
Mandat ad hoc proceedings
French law does not provide for any specific rule in respect of m a n d a t a d h o c proceedings, except that these proceedings (i) are confidential by law (save for their disclosure for statutory auditors if any) and (ii) may only be initiated by the debtor company itself, in its sole discretion. M a n d a t a d h o c proceedings are not limited in time and are informal proceedings carried out under the supervision of the president of the relevant court (usually the Commercial Court), which do not involve any stay of the proceedings.
A company that is facing any type of difficulties (but which is not insolvent; see ``--In s o lv e n c y Test" above) may request from the President of the court the appointment of a m a n d a ta ire a d h o c , whose name it can suggest. The m a n d a ta ire a d h o c 's duties are determined by the court. Such m a n d a ta ire a d h o c is usually appointed in order to facilitate negotiations with the debtor's main creditors but he cannot coerce the creditors into accepting any proposal. The agreement reached by the parties (if any) with the help of such m a n d a ta ire a d h o c can be reported by the latter to the president of the court but is not approved by the court. The restructuring agreement between the company and its main creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis; those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the arrangement.
