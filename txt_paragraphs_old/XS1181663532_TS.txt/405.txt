S u b o rd in a te d P a y m e n ts " above, but only to the extent that Payment is not funded from the proceeds of a payment received from a member of the Group which is otherwise prohibited under the preceding paragraph.
Unless each of the Subordinated Agents waives this requirement, (i) a new Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by a Senior Agent in reliance on a Senior Event of Default more than 60 days after the date that Senior Agent received notice of that Senior Event of Default.
The Senior Agents may only serve one Subordinated Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Senior Agents to issue a Subordinated Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances. No Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a Senior Event of Default which had been notified to the Agents at the time at which an earlier Subordinated Payment Stop Notice was issued.
Any failure to make a payment due under the Subordinated Finance Documents as a result of the issue of a Subordinated Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default (as defined in any Subordinated Finance Document, as applicable) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Subordinated Finance Document; or (ii) the issue of a Subordinated Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Subordinated Creditors.
