NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Restructuring expenses of NOK 118 million in 2012 consisted mainly of severance payments of NOK 105 million as a result of the decision to permanently close 160 000 tonnes of newsprint capacity at Norske Skog Tasman in New Zealand. Other restructuring expenses included NOK 17 million in relation to severance payments and other costs as a result of the ongoing downsizing at head office and changes in corporate management, NOK 8 million in relation to redundancies at Norske Skog Golbey in France, NOK 11 million related to severance payments and other costs following the closure of Norske Skog's shared service centre located in Antwerp in Belgium, and NOK 4 million related to planned redundancies at Norske Skog Skogn. These amounts were offset by the recognition of NOK 24 million income due to the release of provisions expensed in 2011 at Norske Skog Walsum (NOK 21 million) and Norske Skog Bruck (NOK 3 million), as a result of more employees working during the notice period than anticipated.
Restructuring expenses of NOK 387 million in 2011 consisted mainly of NOK 287 million relating to provisions for severance pay and other payroll-related costs (NOK 115 million), and direct closure costs (NOK 172 million) following the decision to shut down the paper production at Norske Skog Follum. Other restructuring expenses recognised in 2011 consisted of NOK 59 million in relation to provisions for severance pay in connection with a cost reduction programme at Norske Skog Walsum, NOK 26 million in relation to the implementation of the new group operating model in May 2011, severance pay and other costs of NOK 13 million at Norske Skog Logistics in Antwerp, NOK 3 million at Norske Skog Focus and NOK 10 million at the head office at Lysaker. There were also some smaller adjustments to restructuring provisions made in earlier periods.
