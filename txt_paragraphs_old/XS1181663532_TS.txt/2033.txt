2. ACCO UNTING PRINCIPLES (Continued)
The amendments relate to the measurement options for non-controlling interests, contingent consideration arising from business combinations prior to adoption of IFRS 3, and the accounting treatment of share-based payment awards. The amendments have not had any impact on the financial statements.
IFRIC 13-- C u s to m e r lo y a lty p ro g r a m m e s The interpretation concerns the measurement of points earned in customer loyalty programmes. The group does not have these types of programme, and the changes have therefore not had any impact on the financial statements.
IF R IC 14, IA S 19-- P re p a ym en ts o f a m in im u m fu n d in g re q u ire m e n t (am e n d m e n t)
The amendment permits a prepayment of future service cost to be recognised as an asset rather than a cost. The am endm ent has not had any impact on the financial statements.
IF R IC 19 E xtin gu ish in g fin a n c ia l liab ilities w ith e q u ity instru m en ts
The interpretation clarifies the accounting treatment when an entity renegotiates the terms of its debt with the result that the liability is extinguished by the debtor issuing its own equity instruments to the creditor. IFRIC 19 requires a gain or loss to be recognised in the income statement when a liability is settled through the issuance of the entity's own equity instruments. The group has not carried out this type of transaction, and the change has therefore not had any impact on the financial statements.
