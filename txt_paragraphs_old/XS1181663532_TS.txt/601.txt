and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates 25.0 million or more;
(7) except as permitted by the Exchange Notes Indenture (including with respect to any limitations), any Exchange Note Guarantee of the Parent Guarantor or a Significant Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor (or any group of Guarantors that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor) is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or the Exchange Notes Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor (or any group of Guarantors that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor) or any Person acting on behalf of any such Guarantor, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Exchange Note Guarantee; and
(8) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Exchange Notes Indenture with respect to the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of its Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.
In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to the Exchange Notes Issuer and any Guarantor, all outstanding Exchange Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Exchange Notes may declare all amounts in respect of the Exchange Notes to be due and payable immediately.
Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Exchange Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Exchange Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any.
Subject to the provisions of the Exchange Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Exchange Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Exchange Notes unless such holders have offered (and if accepted, provided) to the Trustee indemnity or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except (subject to the provisions described under ``-- A m e n d m e n t, S u p p le m e n t a n d W a iv e r" ) to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Exchange Notes Indenture or the Exchange Notes unless:
(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
(2) holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Exchange Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3) such holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense;
