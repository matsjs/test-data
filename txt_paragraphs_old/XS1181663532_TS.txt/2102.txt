NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
4. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQ UIPM ENT (Continued)
Norske Skog owns forests in Australia and Brazil. These assets are valued at fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs. Changes in value are reported in the income statement line Other gains and losses. Machinery and equipment is depreciated over a period from ten to 25 years. Buildings and other property are depreciated over a period from ten to 40 years. Fixtures and fittings are depreciated over a period from three to ten years. Land and plant under construction are not depreciated.
The difference between total additions and purchases of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets in the cash flow statement is due to capitalised allocated emission allowances, finance leases and accruals for payments. In 2011, acquisition costs of NOK 138 million and accumulated depreciation of NOK 65 million were reclassified from machinery to land and buildings. In 2010, NOK 140 million relating to a prior year reversal of dismantling provision was reclassified from land and buildings to machinery and equipment.
