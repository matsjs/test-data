(i) the relevant New York State court or federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City (or any appellate court with jurisdiction over any such court) (as the case may be) had jurisdiction over the defendant determined in accordance with the rules of private international law applied by the New Zealand courts (broadly, if the defendant has submitted or agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts or is resident or present in that jurisdiction);
(ii) the judgment of such court was (1) final and conclusive; (2) for a debt or definite sum of money; (3) not in respect of taxes, fines or penalties; (4) not obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to natural justice; and (5) not contrary to New Zealand public policy; and
(iii) service of process in relation to the proceedings in the relevant U.S. court were properly effected in accordance with New Zealand law.
In addition, subject to certain exceptions, enforcement in New Zealand courts of a U.S. court judgment must be sought within six years of the date the U.S. court judgment became enforceable in the United States.
There is doubt as to the enforceability in New Zealand courts of judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions predicated upon liability provisions of the United States federal or state securities laws where the action is not in respect of purely civil liability, i.e. it is, instead, in respect of a penalty or tax. More generally, however, it is not contrary to public policy to enforce a judgment merely because the cause of action on which it was obtained is not known to New Zealand law.
Insolvency proceedings
In New Zealand the usual processes for dealing with corporate insolvency are very similar to those in Australia. These processes are voluntary administration, liquidation, receivership, statutory management, creditors' compromises and creditors' schemes of arrangement, a summary of each of which is set out below.
