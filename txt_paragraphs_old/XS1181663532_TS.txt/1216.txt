25. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Norske Skog has continued the process related to simplification of the group's corporate structure in 2014. The simplification of the group's corporate structure in combination with changes in individual countries' tax laws could increase the group's tax exposure. However, due to completed reorganisations and tax assessments, the overall tax exposure has decreased during the last years.
