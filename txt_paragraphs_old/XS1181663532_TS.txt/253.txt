We actively monitor and manage our working capital requirements. Generally, our working capital requirements are seasonal and we experience slightly lower cash flow in the first half of the year due to the ramp up in working capital and production of inventories. The focus on optimizing our working capital has been a top priority and our working capital requirements have declined faster than other Group requirements since 2011. We have reduced our working capital requirements primarily through reductions in inventories and an improved control of accounts receivable. The release of working capital over the past three years has been a positive contributor to our cash flow.
