Operating expenses in 2012 decreased by 13.1% to NOK 15,108 million compared to NOK 17,390 million in 2011. The reduction in operating expenses in 2012 was primarily due to reduced capacity in the Group stemming from disposals and capacity closures as well as effects from cost initiatives.
C o s t o f m a te ria ls . Cost of materials decreased by 14.9% to NOK 9,564 million in 2012 from NOK 11,243 million in 2011 primarily due to reduced capacity following the closure of our Follum mill and the sale of our Bio Bio operations. As a percentage of operating revenue, cost of materials decreased from 59.5% of operating revenue in 2011 to 57.6% of operating revenue in 2012. This decrease in cost of materials relative to operating revenues primarily reflected lower per unit fiber prices in Europe, which

offset increases in per unit costs for wood and energy outside of Europe, as well as the effects of costs savings initiatives.
E m p lo y e e b e n e fit e x p e n s e s . Employee benefit expenses decreased by 10.8% to NOK 2,491 million in 2012 from NOK 2,793 million in 2011 primarily as a result of the closure of the Follum mill and the sale of our Bio Bio operations. As a percentage of operating revenue, employee benefit expenses increased slightly from 14.8% of operating revenue in 2011 to 15.0% of operating revenue in 2012, which reflected the net effect of slightly higher employee expenses at our newsprint operations outside of Europe offset by savings in employee expenses in our European Newsprint operating segment. We had 3,986 employees as of December 31, 2012 and 5,075 employees as of December 31, 2011.
O th e r o p e ra tin g e x p e n s e s . Other operating expenses, which primarily include maintenance expenses, administration, insurance, travel, operating leases and other miscellaneous expenses, decreased by 13.7% to NOK 1,252 million in 2012 from NOK 1,450 million in 2011 primarily due to the closure of the Follum mill and sale of our Bio Bio operations in Chile. As a percentage of operating revenue, other operating expenses were stable at 7.5% of operating revenue in 2012 as compared to 7.7% of operating revenue in 2011. The slight decrease in other operating expenses relative to operating expenses was primarily due to cost savings initiatives.
Gross operating earnings
Gross operating earnings (operating earnings before depreciation, restructuring expenses, other gains and losses and impairments) were NOK 1,485 million in 2012 compared to NOK 1,515 million in 2011, a decrease of 2.0%. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross operating earnings increased from 8.0% of operating revenue in 2011 to 9.0% of operating revenue in 2012. The lower gross operating earnings in 2012 were primarily due to weaker pricing for certain of our newsprint operations.
N e w s p rin t. Gross operating earnings from our Newsprint segment were NOK 1,252 million in 2012 compared to NOK 1,318 million in 2011, a decrease of 5.0%, principally due to weaker pricing for our newsprint sales from our Golbey and Tasman mills as well as effects of the disposal of our Bio Bio operations in Chile.
