Taking free rules under the PPS Act
In some circumstances, buyers and lessees can take free of Security Interests even where it is not in the ordinary course of the seller or lessor's business and the purchaser or lessee knows a security interest prohibiting the sale or lease exists. One example is where collateral which can be registered by serial number under the PPS Act (such as motor vehicles, watercraft, aircraft assets and certain intellectual property) is not registered by reference to that serial number (even if the security interest in this collateral is otherwise perfected).
Enforcement of the General Security Deed
Enforcement of Security Interests in Australia can generally be carried out by the holder of the security interest (or a person appointed by it) without court process. The General Security Deed will be able to be enforced following a declared default. Enforcement action may include taking possession of the secured property, exercising a power to sell the secured property or appointing a receiver or receiver and manager to manage and/or sell the secured property.
A receiver or receiver and manager appointed by a secured creditor will have certain powers which will be set out in the General Security Deed, as well as statutory powers, as discussed above.

Stamp duty
If the collateral the subject of the security is located in the State of New South Wales or taken to be located in the State of New South Wales for the purposes of applicable stamp duty legislation, an amount of mortgage duty will be payable on the relevant Security Documents on a proportional basis. To the extent that such stamp duty has not been paid (including any applicable penalties and interest), the Security Documents may not be enforceable in an Australian court and this may adversely affect the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security.
