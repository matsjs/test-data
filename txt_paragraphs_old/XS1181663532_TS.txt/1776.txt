Expected useful life
Norske Skog has conducted sensitivity analyses with respect to changes in expected useful life of the group's paper machines. If the expected useful life of all the group's paper machines is reduced by one year, the annual depreciation charge will increase by around NOK 150 million.
In connection with the year-end closing process for 2012, Norske Skog performed a review of the expected remaining useful lives of PPE. The outcome of the review was that the lifetimes of some of the group's paper machines were reduced with effect from 1 January 2013. The reduced useful lives were reflected in the cash flow horizon, resulting in impairments in the operating segments newsprint and magazine paper. Due to impairment losses recognised in 2012, the future annual depreciation will decrease.
