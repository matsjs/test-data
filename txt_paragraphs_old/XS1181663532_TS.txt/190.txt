Operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased by 9.9% to NOK 8,329 million, compared to NOK 9,241 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating expenses decreased from 94.3% of operating revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to 93.1% of operating revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.
