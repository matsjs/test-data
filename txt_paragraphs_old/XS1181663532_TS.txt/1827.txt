Norske Skog is exposed to liquidity risk in a scenario when the group's cash flow from operating activities is not sufficient to cover payments of financial liabilities. In order to effectively mitigate liquidity risk, Norske Skog's liquidity risk managem ent strategy focuses on maintaining sufficient cash, as well as securing available financing through committed credit facilities.
