(9) the payment of any dividend (or, in the case of any partnership or limited liability company, any similar distribution) by a Restricted Subsidiary to the holders of its Equity Interests (other than the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary) then entitled to participate in such dividends on no more than a pro rata basis;
(10) the payment of any Securitization Fees and purchases of Securitization Assets and related assets pursuant to a Securitization Repurchase Obligation in connection with a Qualified Securitization Financing;
(11) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Subordinated Indebtedness (1) upon a Change of Control to the extent required by the agreements governing such Subordinated Indebtedness at a purchase price not greater than 101% of the principal amount of such Subordinated Indebtedness (or such higher amount specified in any such agreements), but only if the Parent Guarantor shall have complied with its obligations under the covenants described under ``R e p u rc h a s e a t th e O p tio n o f H o ld e r s -- C h a n g e o f C o n tr o l" and the Parent Guarantor repurchased all Exchange Notes tendered pursuant to the offer required by such covenants prior to offering to purchase, purchasing or repaying such Subordinated Indebtedness or (2) if, following an Asset Sale Offer pursuant to which the Parent Guarantor shall have complied with its obligations under the covenant described under ``R e p u rc h a s e a t th e O p tio n o f H o ld e rs -- A s s e t S a le s ' and repurchased all Exchange Notes tendered pursuant to the offer required by such covenant prior to offering to purchase, purchasing or repaying such Subordinated Indebtedness; or
(12) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, other Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 5.0 million since the Issue Date.
The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. Unsecured Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be subordinate or junior to secured Indebtedness by virtue of its nature as unsecured Indebtedness.
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock
The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, ``incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; p r o v id e d , h o w e v e r , that the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock and the Restricted Subsidiaries may issue preferred stock, if on the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or such preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, the Parent Guarantor's Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent Guarantor's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or such preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a p r o fo rm a basis (including a p r o fo rm a application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Restricted Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor that are not Guarantors may not incur Indebtedness pursuant to this paragraph if, after giving p r o fo rm a effect to such incurrence or issuance (including p r o fo rm a application of the net proceeds therefrom), the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors (or the Exchange Notes Issuer) incurred or issued pursuant to this paragraph would exceed 25.0 million.
The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, ``Permitted Debt''):
(1) the incurrence by the Exchange Notes Issuer and any Guarantor of additional Indebtedness under Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) not to exceed 10.0 million, p lu s in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;
