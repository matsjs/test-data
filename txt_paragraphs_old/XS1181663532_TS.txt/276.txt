Provisions are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognized within financial items.

Residual value and dismantling provision The residual value of our production equipment is valued as the anticipated realizable value on our balance sheet date, after deducting the estimated costs relating to asset dismantling, removal and restoration. If the estimated costs exceed the estimated residual values, the net liability is added to the fixed asset cost in our balance sheet and a provision is recognized as a liability. We perform a review of the residual value of our production equipment at the end of each accounting year. Residual value is affected by short-term changes in the underlying assumptions, for example scrap metal prices. A change in the residual value could have an impact on future depreciation costs. The provision for dismantling costs is based on a number of assumptions made using management's best judgment. Pensions The present value of the pension obligation depends on several input factors that are determined by means of a number of actuarial assumptions. The assumptions used in calculating the net pension expense (income) includes the discount rate. Changes in these assumptions will affect the carrying value of the pension obligation.

The paper industry can be broadly divided into three segments: (i) printing and writing papers, consisting of newsprint and magazine paper (also referred to as ``publication paper'' or ``mechanical paper'') and wood-free paper; (ii) packaging and specialty papers, consisting various types of packaging, sack and label papers and (iii) tissue, consisting of various hygiene and personal care papers and products.
The charts below set forth the world's largest publication paper producers by capacity as of September 30, 2014. The list is dominated by Nordic, North American and Japanese participants. Most of these companies, unlike us, have major production capacity within other segments of the pulp and paper industry in addition to publication paper.
