Total debt listed in the repayment schedule may differ from booked debt. This is due to premiums or discounts on issued bonds, hedge reserves and fair value hedging. At 31 Decem ber 2012, the financial statements included a discount of NOK 57 million (discount of NOK 91 million at 31 Decem ber 2011). Premiums or discounts on issued bonds are amortised in the income statement over the lifetime of the issued bonds. See Note 6 for loans secured by mortgage.
As a result of the termination of a large part of the fair value hedge portfolio in the beginning of 2009, an amount was reclassified in the balance sheet. A hedge reserve (deferred income) amounting to NOK 196 million was included in interest-bearing debt as at 31 Decem ber 2012 (NOK 270 million at 31 Decem ber 2011). The hedge reserve does not constitute any payment obligation for the group, but will be amortised in the income statement over the term of the debt that has been hedged.
Total interest-bearing debt is impacted by unrealised currency effects on forward contracts and on cross currency swap contracts. This will also differ from booked debt. At 31 Decem ber 2012, this effect decreased debt by NOK 132 million (debt was decreased by NOK 84 million at 31 Decem ber 2011).
At 31 Decem ber 2012, the group's holding of own bonds amounted to NOK 163 million of Norwegian bonds (NOK 361 million at 31 Decem ber 2011). The group's holding of own bonds in foreign currency amounted to USD 42 million and EUR 132 million, respectively (USD 29 million and EUR 63 million at 31 Decem ber 2011). These holdings are deducted from interest-bearing debt in NOK.
