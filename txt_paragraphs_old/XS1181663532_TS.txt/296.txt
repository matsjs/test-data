Europe
In Europe, we remain among the top five producers in all grades in which we compete (measured in production capacity). In 2013, we were the fourth largest newsprint producer with 12.0% market share based on capacity, the fifth largest producer of coated mechanical paper with 8.0% market share and the fourth largest producer of uncoated mechanical paper with 8.0% market share (according to RISI data adjusted for recent closure announcements). North America remains a more consolidated market than Europe, except in relation to uncoated mechanical paper, which suggests that there is room for further consolidation in the publication paper markets.
Australasia
We are the sole newsprint producer in Australasia with an estimated 83% market share, based on our delivered volume and after taking imports into consideration. After the conversion of one of our two newsprint machines at the Boyer mill, which became fully operational in the second quarter of 2014, we also became the sole producer of coated mechanical paper in the region and expect to cover approximately 35% of demand by the end of 2014 (with the remainder being served by imports). We also supply approximately 150,000 tons of newsprint per annum to the broader Asian market through our trading partner, NorCell Asia.
