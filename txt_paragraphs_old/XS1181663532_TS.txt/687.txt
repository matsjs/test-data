Once an administrator has been appointed, the administrator must investigate the company's business, property, affairs and financial circumstances (and the directors are required to assist the administrator in doing this). Two meetings of creditors are held. The first is held within eight business days of the administrators' appointment. The purpose of that meeting is largely to confirm the appointment of the administrator, or to enable creditors to resolve to replace that administrator.
There is a risk that a Court may make an order under section 444F of the Australian Corporations Act preventing the secured creditor from realising or dealing with its secured interest if doing so would have a material adverse effect on achieving the purposes of a deed of company arrangement approved by creditors at the end of the administration. However, such an order will only be made if the secured creditor's interests will be adequately protected.
During the voluntary administration procedure, a statutory moratorium is imposed which prevents the enforcement of Security Interests against the company and its assets. There are exceptions to the moratorium which apply if the relevant security interest has been perfected within the meaning of the P e rs o n a l P ro p e rty S e c u ritie s A c t 2 0 0 9 of Australia (``PPS Act''), which is summarised below. In particular, a creditor that holds a security interest over the whole, or substantially the whole, of the property of the company is permitted to enforce its security interest within the 13 business day period from the commencement of the administration.
It is common for secured lenders to take security over the whole or substantially the whole of the property of Australian companies to avail themselves of this exception. However, it should be noted that under Australian law, the meaning of ``substantially the whole'' of a company's property remains unsettled. It will likely be interpreted under applicable state law and will be dependent upon particular
