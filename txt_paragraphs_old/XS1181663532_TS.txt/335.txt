contracts until 2023 for delivery of 0.8 TWh of electricity annually, which is sufficient to cover approximately 70% of its expected annual energy consumption. According to RISI, as of December 31, 2012, Skogn's position on the manufacturing cash cost curve for newsprint (assuming Frankfurt delivery) ranked it among the lowest in Europe.
Our Golbey mill, which we began operating in 1992, represented our first business outside of Norway. Its main product is standard newsprint with total production capacity and utilization of 615,000 tons and 95%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,2013, with an actual production of 582,000 tons. Golbey's machines are the newest and most productive of our mills. This productivity, along with sourcing agreements with local communities for recovered paper and sawmill partners for wood, has enabled Golbey to attain a leading cost position. According to RISI, as of December 31,2012, Golbey's manufacturing cash costs for newsprint was ranked among the lowest of European newsprint producers. Our Golbey mill, together with other members of an industrial consortium established by the top 30 French industrial energy consumers , has long-term power contracts for delivery of 0.36 TWh of electricity annually until 2030, which is sufficient to cover approximately one-third of the expected annual energy consumption of the mill. The remaining energy demand of Golbey is covered by energy purchases via a French regulated tariff structure called ARENH.

Our Bruck mill, which we acquired in 1996, was commissioned in 1953 and produces standard newsprint, using primarily mechanical pulp and recycled fiber. Its newsprint production capacity and utilization were 120,000 tons and 100%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,2013, with an actual production of 120,000 tons of newsprint. Bruck is served by its own power plant and can generate approximately 0.4 TWh of electricity, which is sufficient for its expected annual energy consumption. In addition to newsprint, Bruck also produces light-weight coated mechanical paper on a paper machine commissioned in 1989, which uses mechanical pulp produced from wood and recycled fiber and purchased chemical pulp in the manufacturing process. Its total magazine paper production capacity and utilization were 260,000 tons and 87%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, with an actual production of 226,000 tons of light-weight coated. However, following the closure of one machine at Walsum at the end of 2013, the production at Bruck's magazine machine has been increased to almost its full capacity. Bruck benefits from low cost on-machine coating technology and, according to RISI, Bruck's cash manufacturing costs (assuming Frankfurt delivery) for magazine paper was ranked among the lowest in Europe as of December 31, 2012.

Our Walsum mill, which is located in Germany, produces light-weight coated mechanical paper and has one paper machine, which uses mechanical pulp and purchased chemical pulp in the manufacturing process. The mill's total production capacity and utilization were 200,000 tons and 99%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,2013, after the permanent closure of one paper machine. The mill's favorable location on the Rhine River provides easy access to raw materials and sea freight. The mill consumes approximately 0.4 TWh of electricity annually, which is purchased from the market on a spot basis or pursuant to short-term contracts.
Australasia We have three publication paper mills in Australasia, which had a combined annual production capacity of 715,000 tons as of September 30, 2014. Our total production from our Australasian mills was 622,645 tons in 2013.
