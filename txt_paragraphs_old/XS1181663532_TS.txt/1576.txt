The defined benefit schemes in Norway cover people between 55 and 67 years of age, who were employed before 1 January 2011. The defined benefit obligations in Norway only encompass active members (a small number of people in early retirement until the end of 2015), since they leave the defined benefit scheme (having a paid-up policy) when they retire.
