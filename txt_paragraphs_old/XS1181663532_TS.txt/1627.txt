Norske Skog Pisa Ltda.
On 14 June 2013, Norske Skog signed an agreement for the sale of 51% of its shares in Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. in Brazil. The transaction was completed with effect from 27 June 2013. Following the transaction, Norske Skog was no longer the controlling owner of the mill, and Norske Skog Pisa was therefore deconsolidated from 27 June 2013. Norske Skog's remaining share of 49% has been accounted for as an associated company in accordance with the equity method. At the time of the initial divestment, Norske Skog had also agreed upon the terms of sale for the remaining 49% of its shares in Norske Skog Pisa. In January 2014, Norske Skog renegotiated the terms of the sale of the remaining stake, with an accelerated timeline, and a sales price of USD 37 million. The value of the investment in Norske Skog Pisa Ltda. at the end of December reflects the agreed sales price of USD 37 million (NOK 223 million). The sales proceeds will be received in the second quarter of 2014. The gain (loss) from the sale of the shares in Norske Skog Pisa Ltda., including the value adjustment at 31 December 2013, has been classified within the income statement line item Other gains and losses. See Note 16 for further information.
