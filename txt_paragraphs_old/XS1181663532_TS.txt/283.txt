Capacity Development Global overcapacity has been largely driven by demand decline and some capacity build-up in Asia over the past decade. As a result, and in order to maintain some market balance, capacity has been substantially reduced in North America, Western Europe, Japan and other traditional markets.
Historical closures From 2008 to 2013, capacity in newsprint, uncoated mechanical and coated mechanical papers was reduced by a total of approximately seven million tons, or 27% of 2008 total capacity. Over this period, we reduced our capacity by over 0.6 million tons, or 20% of our total capacity.
