portion of the vesting period. All changes in the liability are recognised in profit or loss for the period. The fair value of the liability is determined by applying an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions on which the cash-settled transaction was granted, and the extent to which the employees have rendered services to date. Norske Skog has made a fair value measurement of the liability using a Black & Scholes model for European call options with no dividends.
