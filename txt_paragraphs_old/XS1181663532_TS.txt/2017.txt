Impairment of non-financial assets
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Financial assets
The group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and financial assets available for sale. This classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired. Managem ent determines the classification of an investment at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.

This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. A financial asset is classified in this category if it was acquired principally for the purpose of short-term sale or if so designated by management. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
