All amounts presented in the table are notional amounts. Total interest-bearing liabilities will therefore differ from booked amounts due to bond discounts/premiums, hedge reserve, and unrealised effects from fair value hedging (see Note 11 Interest-bearing liabilities). Floating rate exposure is calculated without accounting for potential future refinancing.
