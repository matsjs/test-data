The Exchange Notes Issuer shall not be permitted to redeem the 2033 Notes pursuant to the provisions set forth in the first, second and fourth paragraphs of this section until all 2021 Notes are redeemed or repaid.
General
Unless the Exchange Notes Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Exchange Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.
Any redemption and notice may, in the Exchange Notes Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent.
Redemption for Changes in Taxes
The Exchange Notes Issuer may redeem the Exchange Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the holders of the Exchange Notes (which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in ` `-- S e le c tio n a n d N o tic e " ), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Exchange Notes Issuer for redemption (a ``Tax Redemption Date'') and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the Exchange Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Exchange Notes or any Exchange Note Guarantee, the Exchange Notes Issuer or relevant Guarantor is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts (but, in the case of the relevant Guarantor, only if such amounts cannot be paid by the Exchange Notes Issuer or another Guarantor who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and the Exchange Notes Issuer and/or the relevant Guarantors cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available (including, making payment through a Paying Agent located in another jurisdiction), and the requirement arises as a result of:
(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of these listing particulars (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date these listing particulars, such later date); or
(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official interpretation or application of such laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which amendment or change has not been publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of these listing particulars (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of these listing particulars, such later date).
In the case of Additional Amounts required to be paid as a result of the Exchange Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor conducting business other than in the place of its organization, such amendment or change must be announced and become effective on or after the date in which the Exchange Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, begins to conduct business giving rise to the relevant withholding or deduction.
