During preliminary insolvency proceedings a ``preliminary creditors' committee'' (v o rla u fig e r G la u b ig e ra u s s c h u s s ) can be appointed by the court if the debtor satisfies two of the following three requirements (in the financial year prior to the insolvency filing): a balance sheet total in excess of 4,840,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted), revenues of at least 9,680,000 in the 12 months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing and/or fifty or more employees in the yearly average. The requirements apply to the respective entity without taking into account the assets of other group companies. The preliminary creditors' committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator ( v o rla u fig e r In s o lv e n z v e rw a lte r) or an insolvency administrator (In s o lv e n z v e rw a lte r), orders for ``debtor-in-possession'' proceedings (A n o rd n u n g d e r E ig e n v e rw a ltu n g ), and the appointment of a preliminary trustee ( v o rla u fig e r S a c h w a lte r).

parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (A b w e is u n g m a n g e ls M a s s e ) following which the company will be deemed dissolved and put into liquidation.
Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, the right to administer and dispose over the business and assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator (In s o lv e n z v e rw a lte r) who is appointed by the insolvency court unless the so-called ``debtor-in-possession'' (E ig e n v e rw a ltu n g ) is ordered, in which event the court will only appoint a trustee (S a c h w a lte r) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. The creditors are only entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors' assembly (e rs te G la u b ig e rv e rs a m m lu n g ) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e. sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial.
The insolvency administrator has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor's assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession, the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor's operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the insolvency estate (M a s s e s c h u ld e n ) will be preferred to any liabilities created by the debtor (or a preliminary insolvency administrator/trustee prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (including secured debt, subject to rights of separate satisfaction (A b s o n d e ru n g s re c h te ) and other Security Interests). The insolvency administrator or trustee may, on the grounds of avoidance (In s o lv e n z a n fe c h tu n g ), also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (A u s s o n d e ru n g s re c h t) as opposed to a preferential right (A b s o n d e ru n g s re c h t)), wishing to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (In s o lv e n z o rd n u n g ). Any individual enforcement action (Z w a n g s v o lls tre c k u n g ) already brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once formal insolvency proceedings have been opened (and may be subject to such stay already prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, certain secured creditors have preferential rights (A b s o n d e ru n g s re c h te ) regarding the enforcement of their security interest. Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any moveable assets within its possession which are subject to preferential rights (A b s o n d e ru n g s re c h te ) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights (M o b ilia rp fa n d re c h te ) or transfers of title by way of security (S ic h e ru n g s u a b e re ig n u n g )) as well (ii) to collect any claims that have been assigned by way of security (S ic h e ru n g s a b tre tu n g e n ). In case that the enforcement right is vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (F e s ts te llu n g s k o s te n ) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (V e rw e rtu n g s k o s te n ) which, in aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds, and less German value added tax (U m s a tz s te u e r) at a rate of currently 19% thereon (if applicable), are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims.
The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (M a sse g la a u b ig e r) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings). Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate. Most other claims (In s o lv e n z fo rd e ru n g e n ), in particular claims of unsecured creditors unless they are subordinated as a matter of statutory law, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate of the debtor (In s o lv e n z m a s s e ) after all Security Interests and prior-ranking liabilities have been settled and paid. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (In s o lv e n z p la n ) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which requires, among others and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a

debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor of debt into a debt-to-equity swap if it does not consent to such debt-to-equity swap.
The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (A b s o n d e ru n g s re c h t) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, may then be required to compensate the creditor for the loss in value of such movable asset.
