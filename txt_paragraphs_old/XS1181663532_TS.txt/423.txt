(h) Where the Instructing Group is the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors may waive the requirement for an Advisor's Opinion where sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Enforcement Proceeds Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full.
(j) In the absence of written notice from a secured party or group of secured parties that are not part of the relevant Instructing Group that such secured part(y/ies) object to any enforcement of the Transaction Security on the grounds that such Enforcement Action does not aim to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective (an ``Objection''), the Security Agent is entitled to assume that such enforcement of the Transaction Security is in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective.
(k) If the Security Agent receives an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the Security Agent to rely on other advisers and/or exercise its own judgment in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), an Advisor's Opinion (or any equivalent opinion referred to in paragraph (g) above) to the effect that the particular action could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving the Security Enforcement Objective will be conclusive evidence that the requirement of paragraph (a) above has been met.
E xe rcise o f V oting R ights
To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each creditor (other than any Senior Secured Notes Trustee or Senior Notes Trustee) agrees with the Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the Security Agent. The Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this paragraph entitles any party to exercise or require any other creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement to exercise its power of voting or representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend the due date for payment or otherwise reschedule any of the liabilities owed to that creditor.
W aiver o f R ights
To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to require that the Transaction Security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the Transaction Security or of any other security interest, which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the secured obligations, is so applied.
S e cu rity H e ld b y O th e r C reditors
If any Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the Security Agent, then that creditor may only enforce that security in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing Group pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and for this purpose references to the Security Agent shall be construed as references to that creditor).
