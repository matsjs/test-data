For purposes of determining compliance with this ``In c u r r e n c e o f In d e b te d n e s s a n d Is s u a n c e o f P re fe rre d S to c k " covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (23) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Parent Guarantor, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant from time to time to reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant.
The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock or the requalification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness as of the Issue Date (including, without limitation, capital leases) due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred; p ro v id e d , however, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated in non-euro currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement with respect to the euro the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the euro-equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the euro-equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally incurred, except that to the extent that:
