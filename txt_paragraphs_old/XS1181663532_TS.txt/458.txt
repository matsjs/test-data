(7) any Taxes imposed, levied or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of Notes to comply with any reasonable written request of the Issuer (made at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request) to satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;
In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the holder of Notes for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise or property Taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties and interest related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction (or any jurisdiction if such Taxes are required to be paid in connection with the enforcement of the Notes, the Indenture or any other document referred to therein following the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes) on the execution, delivery,

issuance, or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein, or the enforcement of any of the Notes.
If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, each of, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agents on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer's Certificate(s) must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee and the Paying Agents shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make or cause to be made all withholdings and deductions required by law and will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. Upon request, copies of Tax receipts or other evidence of payments, as the case may be, will be made available by the Trustee to the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes.
Whenever in the Indenture, the Notes, or in this ``D e s c r ip tio n o f th e S e n io r S e c u r e d N o te s " there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, m u ta tis m u ta n d is , to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment on the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.
