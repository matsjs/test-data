(d) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious, it being acknowledged that, subject to the other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the time frame for the realization of value from the enforcement of the Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal will be determined by the Instructing Group, provided that it is consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective.
i. a proposed enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than shares in a member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds 5,000,000 (or its equivalent); or
ii. a proposed enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the shares in a member of the Group over which transaction security exists,
the Security Agent shall, upon instruction from the Instructing Group (unless it is incompatible with enforcement proceedings in a relevant jurisdiction) appoint an internationally recognized investment bank or a ``big four'' accounting firm or other reputable, third party independent professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets, in each case as selected by the Security Agent acting reasonably and in good faith (an ``Advisor''), to opine as expert that the proceeds received from any such enforcement are fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances (including the method of enforcement) (an ` Advisor's Opinion'').
(f) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint an Advisor or to seek the advice of an Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by these security enforcement principles or any other provision of the Intercreditor Agreement.
(g) The Advisor's Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation to any other enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met.

(h) Where the Instructing Group is the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors may waive the requirement for an Advisor's Opinion where sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Enforcement Proceeds Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full.
(i) In the event that an enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares referred to in paragraph (e)(i) or (e)(ii) above and such enforcement is conducted by way of ``public auction'', the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors shall be entitled to participate in such auction on the basis of equal information and access rights as other bidders and financiers in the auction. Nothing in this paragraph (i) shall require enforcement of the Transaction Security to take place by way of public auction.
