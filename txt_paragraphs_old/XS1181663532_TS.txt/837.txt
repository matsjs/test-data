From the first quarter of 2015, Norske Skog has changed its accounting practice for embedded derivatives in energy contracts in Norway. The new accounting policy is assessed to result in financial reporting that is more aligned to the rationale for requiring separation of embedded derivatives and will accordingly result in more relevant and less volatile information being presented to the users of the financial statements. In accordance with IAS 8 A c c o u n tin g P o lic ie s , C h a n g e s in A c c o u n tin g E s tim a te s , 2014 figures in the condensed consolidated income statement, condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed consolidated balance sheet and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows have been restated. The implementation effects of the amended practices are further described in Note 7.
Preparation of interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS implies use of estimates, which are based on judgements and assumptions that affect the application of accounting principles and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual amounts might differ from such estimates.

Intangible assets which have an indefinite useful life and goodwill are not subject to amortisation, but are tested annually for impairment. Property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from a cash-generating unit. Norske Skog applies a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) model for calculating the present value of future cash flows. Calculation of value in use requires use of estimates. There was no indication that further impairments or reversals of previous impairments should be made at 31 March 2015.

Commodity contracts that fail to meet the own-use exemption criteria in IAS 39 F in a n c ia l in s tru m e n ts -- re c o g n itio n a n d m e a s u re m e n t are recognised in the balance sheet and valued at fair value. Fair values of commodity contracts and embedded derivatives in commodity contracts which are not traded in an active marked, are assessed through valuation techniques. Norske Skog has one long-term energy contract in New Zealand. The electricity prices for long-term electricity contracts in New Zealand are not directly observable in the market for the whole contract length. Price forecasts from acknowledged external sources are used in the estimation of fair value. The group uses its judgement to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. See Note 9 in the annual financial statements for 2014 for more information regarding the calculation of fair value of derivatives.
