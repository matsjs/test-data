NORSKE SKOGINDUSTRIER ASA NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
9. DERIVATIVES (Continued)
The electricity prices for long-term electricity contracts in New Zealand are not directly observable in the market for the whole contract length. A change in the forecast to a reasonably possible alternative would change the fair value. For the energy contracts in New Zealand, a reasonably possible alternative at 31 December 2013 would be a downwards parallel shift of the long end of the forward curve of 2% (downwards shift of 3% in 2012).12
