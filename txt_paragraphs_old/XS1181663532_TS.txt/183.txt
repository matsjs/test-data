Europe. Operating revenue in our European segment decreased by 0.7% to NOK 6,720 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to NOK 6,764 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This decrease in operating revenue was principally due to lower sales volume attributable to the closure of one of two paper machines at the Walsum mill in December 2013, which was partly offset by improved pricing. Total volume of publication paper sold by us in Europe in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased by 8.4% to 1,502,000 tons, compared to 1,639,000 tons in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Demand for European publication paper fell 4.0% during the nine months ended September 30, 2014, which reflected a decline in demand for European newsprint of 5.1% and a decline in demand for European magazine paper of 3.2% as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, prices for European newsprint increased slightly while prices for European magazine paper decreased in the same period compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013, based on prices in Germany established by RlSl.
