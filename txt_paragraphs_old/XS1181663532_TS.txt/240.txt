Operating expenses in 2012 decreased by 13.1% to NOK 15,108 million compared to NOK 17,390 million in 2011. The reduction in operating expenses in 2012 was primarily due to reduced capacity in the Group stemming from disposals and capacity closures as well as effects from cost initiatives.
D is trib u tio n c o s ts . Distribution costs decreased by 7.9% to NOK 1,645 million in 2012 from NOK 1,786 million in 2011 primarily due to the closure of our Follum mill in Norway and the sale of our Bio Bio operations in Chile. As a percentage of operating revenue, distribution costs increased from 9.4% of operating revenue in 2011 to 9.9% of operating revenue in 2012. This increase in distribution costs relative to operating earnings was primarily due to changes in customer mix as our continuing operations (particularly our newsprint operations outside of Europe) increased their relative volume of exports as compared to local sales.
