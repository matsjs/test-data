· Australasia: in Australasia, we operate three mills, including two in Australia and one in New Zealand:
· Boyer (Australia): our Boyer mill has an annual production capacity of 150,000 tons of newsprint and 140,000 tons of LWC, which was partially converted in 2014 to produce coated mechanical paper.
· Tasman (New Zealand): our Tasman mill supplies all of New Zealand's newsprint and telephone directory requirements, with export production throughout Asia and the South Pacific. The mill has an annual production capacity of 155,000 tons of newsprint.
Publication Paper Industry Trends
Europe
We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from any price increases in the European publication paper sector. According to RISI forecasts, publication paper prices are expected to demonstrate a mixed development in 2015, with decreasing prices in the first half of the year, followed by increasing prices in the second half of the year. The price increases across all grades are expected to continue further in 2016. By the end of 2015, as compared to price levels at the end of 2014, Western European SC prices are expected to increase by 3.2%, LWC prices are expected to increase by 4.2% and newsprint prices are expected to decrease by 0.6%. In 2016, RISI expects average prices to increase by 5.1% in newsprint, 5.1% in SC and 5.9% in LWC from average 2015 price levels. We believe these forecasts imply that the publication paper sector is showing signs of stabilization from current pricing levels, despite somewhat mixed developments for 2015. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of print for publishers' revenue generation, publishers' investment in print sites, a stabilization of the decline of global publication paper demand and anticipated reductions in overcapacity will be factors that will influence positive pricing trends during the next few years.
According to PPPC, Western European newsprint demand declined by 4.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year period, 5.8% in 2013 and 10.6% in 2012. Uncoated mechanical paper demand declined by 5.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to the prior year period, and 1.6% in 2013 and 5.1% in 2012. Coated mechanical paper demand declined by 3.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to the prior year period, and 7.8% in 2013 and 8.9% in 2012. On the supply side, there have been significant capacity closures in recent years, with additional closures set to occur during the first quarter of 2015 following UPM Kymmene Corporation's (``UPM'') announced closure of approximately 800,000 tons of publication paper capacity in November 2014 and previous announcements of approximately 580,000 tons of capacity closure by other industry players, including Stora Enso Oyj (``Stora Enso''). We believe these industry dynamics are factors that could contribute to higher utilization rates and a potential improvement in the pricing environment in Europe.
Australasia
Similar to Europe, through September 30, 2014, the rate of decline of newsprint demand in Australasia fell to 6.1%, compared to 17.1% in 2013 and 11.9% in 2012. In response to reduced demand, we have significantly reduced newsprint capacity in the region by permanently closing one of our two paper machines at our Tasman mill in 2013, which had an annual newsprint capacity of 160,000 tons, and converting one of the paper machines at our Boyer mill from newsprint to coated mechanical, reducing newsprint capacity in the region by an additional 120,000 tons while adding 140,000 of LWC capacity.
