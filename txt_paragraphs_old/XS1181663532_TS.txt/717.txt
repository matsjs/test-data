The conciliator acting as ``m a n d a ta ire a I 'e x e c u tio n d e I 'a c c o r d " may monitor the implementation of the conciliation agreement, when the conciliation agreement is approved by the Court.
The conciliation agreement can also be approved by the court upon the debtor's request. The approval by the Court, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, will make the existence of the conciliation proceedings public (not the content of the agreement--save for the information of the employees' representatives if any) will have the following specific consequences:
· creditors who provided new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity) in the course of conciliation proceedings leading to an approved conciliation agreement or in application of an approved conciliation agreement will have priority of payment over all pre-proceeding and post-proceeding claims (other than certain pre-proceeding employment claims and post-proceeding procedural costs) (the ``New Money Lien''), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; and
· in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, the payment date of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not be rescheduled without their holders' consent;
· in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of the c e s s a tio n d e s p a ie m e n ts and therefore the commencement date of the suspect period cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval of the agreement by the court.
A third party having granted a guarantee (s u re te p e rs o n n e lle ) or a security interest (s u re te re e lle ) can benefit from the grace periods granted to the debtor during conciliation proceedings as well as from the provisions of the approved or acknowledged agreement.

In the event of a breach of the agreement, any party to the agreement can petition the court for its termination. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims and Security Interests, except amounts already paid to them.
Conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported by a large majority of creditors without reaching unanimity, will be a mandatory preliminary step of the accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.
