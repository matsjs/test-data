Insolvency proceedings (In s o lv e n z v e rfa h re n ) must be opened by the competent court upon application by the debtor or a creditor whenever a company is (i) illiquid (z a h lu n g s u n fa h ig ), i.e., unable to pay its debts in due time, (ii) or is over-indebted in terms of insolvency law (in s o lv e n z re c h tlic h u b e rs c h u ld e t), i.e., when the liabilities exceed its assets at liquidation values (re c h n e ris c h e U b e rs c h u ld u n g ) and the company has a negative prospect for its continued existence (n e g a tiv e F o rtb e s te h e n s p ro g n o s e ). In addition, restructuring proceedings (S a n ie ru n g s v e rfa h re n ) may also be initiated, if the risk of the debtor's inability to pay its debts is at least imminent (d ro h e n d e Z a h lu n g s u n fa h ig k e it) and the debtor files an application for the opening of such proceedings.
Restructuring plans intend to discharge the debtor from a part of its debts (up to 80%) and to enable the debtor to continue its business activities. A qualified simple majority of unsecured creditors has to approve the restructuring plan. Qualified simple majority means a simple majority (in number) of unsecured creditors present at the hearing, representing more than 50% of the total sum of these unsecured creditors' claims present at the hearing. If the restructuring plan is accepted by the creditors, confirmed by the court and fulfilled by the debtor, the latter is released from the rest of its debts. If the debtor files qualified documents together with a restructuring plan offering a quota of at least 30% in its application for the opening of insolvency proceedings, the debtor is entitled to self administration under supervision of a restructuring administration (S a n ie ru n g s v e rfa h re n m it E ig e n v e rw a ltu n g u n te r A u fs ic h t e in e s V e rw a lte rs ). If the realization of a restructuring plan fails, the insolvency proceeding will be continued as bankruptcy proceedings.
Unless the debtor meets the requirements for self administration, the debtor is not any longer in the position to dispose assets subject to insolvency (In s o lv e n z m a s s e ) as of the opening of insolvency proceedings. The opening takes effect as of 12:00 a.m. of the day following the publication of the receiving order in the official insolvency data base (www.edikte.justiz.gv.at). Legal acts of the debtor in relation to the debtor's assets take no effect towards the creditors after the initiation of insolvency proceedings. Unless the debtor meets the requirements for self administration, the court appoints an insolvency administrator (In s o lv e n z v e rw a lte r) along with its decision on the opening of the insolvency proceedings, and, if it deems this necessary in view of the size of the debtor's business, a creditors' committee (G la u b ig e ra u s s c h u s s ) to assist the insolvency administrator. After the opening of insolvency proceedings without self administration (bankruptcy proceedings or restructuring proceedings) only the insolvency administrator is entitled to act on behalf of the debtor's estate.
The insolvency administrator's main task is to administer and realize the assets of the debtor's estate effectively. According to Austrian insolvency law, the insolvency administrator shall continue the debtor's business in order to enable a potential reorganization of the debtor's business either by realizing the debtor's restructuring plan (which he may also apply for during the bankruptcy proceedings) or by selling the debtor's business. If neither a restructuring plan nor the sale of the debtor's business is possible, the insolvency administrator will break up the company and the bankruptcy proceedings will ultimately lead to the sale and distribution of the debtor's assets and the debtor will remain liable for its residual debts. If the debtor meets the requirements for self administration, the debtor is monitored by a restructuring administrator (S a n ie ru n g s v e rw a lte r) appointed by the court to whom certain transactions are reserved.
Unsecured creditors (In s o lv e n z g la u b ig e r) must file their claims with the competent court within the time period set out in the court order on the opening of insolvency proceedings (usually two months). At the examination hearing (P ru fu n g s ta g s a tz u n g ), which is held by the competent court, the insolvency administrator must declare whether he acknowledges or contests a claim filed by unsecured creditors. If

the insolvency administrator acknowledges a creditor's claim, the creditor is entitled to participate in the insolvency proceeding, which means that such creditor will receive the quota that is distributed to the unsecured creditors. If a creditor's claim is contested by the insolvency administrator, the creditor must assert its claim in civil proceedings in order to maintain its right to participate in the insolvency proceedings.
Claims of unsecured creditors in insolvency proceedings, which were created before the opening of the proceedings, rank p a r i p a s s u . Taxes, social security contributions, wages and salaries are not, as such, privileged or preferential claims under Austrian insolvency law. Claims which lawfully arose against the debtor's estate after the opening of the proceedings, so called privileged claims (M a s s e fo rd e ru n g e n ) or claims which are secured by collateral (e.g., by a mortgage, a pledge over bank accounts or shares, an assignment of receivables for security purposes or a security transfer of moveable assets), so called preferential claims (A b s o n d e ru n g s re c h te ), enjoy priority in insolvency proceedings. Creditors of preferential claims have a right to preferential satisfaction from the proceeds of the realization of the assets serving as collateral, thereby excluding unsecured creditors. However, such secured creditors may participate in the pro rata distribution only to the extent that the proceeds from the realization of the collateral issued to them did not cover their claims or if they have waived their right to preferential treatment. Secured creditors do not have a voting right on the restructuring plan to the extent their claim is covered by security.
The costs of the insolvency proceedings and certain liabilities accrued during insolvency proceedings rank prior to all other claims. Creditors with a right of separation of assets (A u s s o n d e ru n g s b e re c h tig te ), such as creditors with retention of title, remain unaffected by the opening of insolvency proceedings though they may be barred from exercising their rights for a maximum period of six months following the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the exercise of such rights would endanger the carrying on of the debtor's business and the interdiction does not cause severe personal or economic damage to the secured creditor. The same applies for secured creditors of preferential claims
