In certain jurisdictions in which Security Interests are being provided in favor of the Senior Secured Notes, including Austria, France and Germany, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the relevant security documents and/or the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of ``parallel debt'' obligations in favor of the Security Agent, and the Security Interests in such jurisdictions will secure the parallel debt only, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The parallel debt construct has not been tested in court in certain of these jurisdictions and to the extent that the Security Interests in the Collateral created under the parallel debt construct are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the Security Interests in the Collateral. See ``Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests" .
The security documents allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing

the Senior Secured Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee or Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.
There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes under which the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will be released automatically, without your consent or the Trustee or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent.
Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will be released automatically, including:
· a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the asset sale covenant of the Indenture;
· with respect to Collateral held by a Guarantor, upon the release of such Guarantor from its Guarantee; and
· in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement.
