The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in ``-- S e le c tio n a n d N o tic e " ), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a ``Tax Redemption Date'') and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, the Issuer or relevant Guarantor is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts (but, in the case of the relevant Guarantor, only if such amounts cannot be paid by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and the Issuer and/or the relevant Guarantors cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available (including, making payment through a Paying Agent located in another jurisdiction), and the requirement arises as a result of:
(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official interpretation or application of such laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which amendment or change has not been publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of these listing particulars (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of these listing particulars, such later date).
In the case of Additional Amounts required to be paid as a result of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor conducting business other than in the place of its organization, such amendment or change must be announced and become effective on or after the date in which the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, begins to conduct business giving rise to the relevant withholding or deduction.
The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantees were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect
173
that there has been such amendment or change which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it.
The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.
The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.
For the avoidance of doubt, the implementation of European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive will not be a change or amendment for such purposes.
