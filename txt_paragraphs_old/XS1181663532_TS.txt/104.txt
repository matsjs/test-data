The indenture and fiscal agency agreements governing the Parent's Existing Notes contain, and the indentures governing the Notes and the Exchange Notes will contain, certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could cause an acceleration of all of our debts.
