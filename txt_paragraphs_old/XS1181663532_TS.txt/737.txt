Hardening periods and fraudulent transfer
In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a German Provider, which would most likely be based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the guarantee or security interest provided by that entity could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator (In s o lv e n z v e rw a lte r) under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung).
Under these rules, an insolvency administrator (or in the event of debtor-in possession proceedings, the trustee (S a c h w a lte r)), may challenge acts (R e c h ts h a n d lu n g e n ) and transactions ( R e c h ts g e s c h a fte ) that are deemed detrimental to the insolvency estate and have been effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings. Such challengeable transactions can include payments under any guarantee or security or the granting of any guarantee or security interest. In the event that a transaction is successfully challenged, the beneficiaries of such guarantee (such as the holders of Notes) or such security interest would be under an obligation to repay the amount already received under the relevant security or guarantee, or to waive the guarantee or security interest. In particular, a transaction detrimental to the insolvency estate may be challenged according to the German Insolvency Code in the following cases:
 any act (R e c h ts h a n d lu n g ) or transaction (R e c h ts g e s c h a ft) granting a creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain security (S ic h e ru n g ) or satisfaction for a debt (B e frie d ig u n g ) can be avoided if such act was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid (z a h lu n g s u n fa h ig ), which means such debtor was unable to pay its debt when due and the creditor had knowledge thereof, or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed and the creditor had knowledge of such illiquidity or of the filing of such petition (or knowledge of circumstances which imperatively suggesting such cash flow insolvency);
 any act (R e c h ts h a n d lu n g ) or transaction (R e c h ts g e s c h a ft) granting a creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction can be avoided if such act was effected in the month prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; if such act was effected in the second and third month prior to the filing, it can be avoided if at the time of such act (i) the debtor was cash illiquid, or (ii) the creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental to the creditors of the debtor (or knowledge of circumstances which imperatively suggesting such detrimental effects);
 any transaction (R e c h ts g e s c h a ft) effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors of the debtor, or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable if it was entered into, can be avoided if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid and the other party to the transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the debtor and the other party to the transaction had knowledge of either the debtor's illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction;
 any act by the debtor without adequate consideration (e.g. whereby a debtor grants security for a third party debt) might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (u n e n tg e ltlic h ); a gratuitous transaction can be avoided if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor;
