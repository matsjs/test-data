NORSKE SKOG GROUP NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
25. CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT Norske Skog's objective when managing capital is to maximise return on equity within the limits set by the group's external debt financing. In order to improve the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. The group monitors its capital structure on the basis of interest coverage ratio (EBITDA / net interest expense) and the debt ratio (net interest-bearing debt / EBITDA). The group was within the limits for the key figures as at 31 Decem ber 2011. For more information see Note 11. The strategy for managing capital was changed in 2011, as a result of new loan covenants. Previously, the capital managem ent was monitored on the basis of gearing, which was calculated as net interest bearing debt divided by equity.
26. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Norske Skog is an international com pany that, through its ongoing business operations, will be exposed to litigation and claims from public authorities and contracting parties. At the end of 2011, the group is in dialogues with tax authorities in Norway and Australia regarding previously completed transactions. The ongoing simplification of the group's corporate structure, and changes individual countries' tax laws, could increase the group's tax exposure. The group's assessment is that sufficient provisions have been made for the aforementioned conditions.
27. RELATED PARTIES All transactions with related parties are conducted in accordance with the arm 's length principle. Some of Norske Skogindustrier ASA's shareholders are forest owners delivering forestry products to the group's production units in Norway. A former board member, Halvor Bjørken, is a forest owner who supplies wood to the group on normal standardised terms. Bjørken left the board of directors during 2011.

Bhd. purchases recovered paper from Reparco companies in the Norske Skog group.
