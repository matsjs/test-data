was approximately 140,000 tons in 2013. In Europe, chemical pulp for magazine production is sourced both through a common group contract and by local suppliers at Bruck and Walsum. The contract pricing is subject to a monthly adjustment with reference to a third-party reference price. The price for chemical pulp increased in 2013 and 2014, largely as a result of strong demand in China.
Transportation
Raw materials
Recycled fiber is a globally traded commodity, but environmental considerations apply when we are purchasing this material. Trucks are the predominant method we use for transporting raw materials to our mills, representing approximately 78% of inward transport in 2013. Ship and train deliveries of raw materials to our mills accounted for 14% and 8%, respectively, of inward transport in 2013.
Finished products
We typically transport our products by various means, including by sea, truck and rail. We ship products from our Norwegian mills primarily using coastline ports that are equipped with modern deep sea docks. Products from our other European mills are transported and distributed on the European continent primarily by truck and by rail. Paper produced by our operations in Australasia is mostly sold in the country in which it is produced and is generally transported by ship, truck and rail. The volume exported to Asia is transported by ship.
For the year ended December 31,2013, 41% of our finished products (by volume) were transported to customers via trucks, while ship and rail transport represented 35% and 24%, respectively, of outward transport.
