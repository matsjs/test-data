No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the issuance of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See ` `R is k

secured by the Collateral, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture and the Security Documents, which provide, among other things, that the obligations under certain Hedging Obligations and the Notes are secured equally and ratably by a first-priority Security Interest; however, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of Notes will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after certain super senior priority obligations, including certain Hedging Obligations, have been paid in full. See ``D e s c r ip tio n o f O th e r In d e b te d n e s s -- In te rc r e d ito r A g r e e m e n t." In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness.

Security Documents
Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer's and the Guarantors' payment obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent and, in relation to the Australian and New Zealand security documents, security trustee for the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the holders of Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as an agent and, in relation to the Australian and New Zealand security documents, security trustee, of the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.
