Albury operations
Our Albury mill is the youngest mill in the Australasian segment. Its single machine was commissioned in 1981 and produces standard newsprint. The mill underwent a significant rebuild in 2006, which included the addition of a shoe press. Total production capacity and utilization at our Albury mill were 270,000 tons and 91%, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,2013, with an actual production of 246,000 tons of newsprint. Our Albury mill has a long-term power contract until 2022 for delivery of approximately 0.7 TWh of electricity annually, which is sufficient to cover all of its expected annual energy consumption. In addition, our Albury mill purchases gas to produce steam under a contract terminating in 2016. Prior to the termination of this contract, another gas supply agreement will need to be finalized, and preparations are being made for its negotiation. It is expected that any new gas supply arrangement will come at a greater cost than current arrangements. Gas prices in the eastern Australian market are rising and moving away from the domestic price of gas towards the international market price of gas (which has, in the past, been much higher than the domestic price paid). Albury benefits from a favorable location with low distribution costs to the major Australian metropolitan regions of Melbourne and Sydney. Albury produces newsprint using both wood and recycled fiber. Almost 90% of the mill's consumption of wood is supplied by medium-term contracts with terms varying from 2015 to 2018, 35% of the recycled paper is sourced directly from publishers' waste.
