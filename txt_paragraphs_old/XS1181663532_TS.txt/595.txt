The Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if (1) such designation would not cause a Default and (2) the Exchange Notes Issuer would, at the time of such designation, have been permitted to incur at least 1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant under the caption ``--In c u rre n c e o f In d e b te d n e s s a n d Is s u a n c e o f P r e fe r r e d S to c k " . If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption ``-- R e s tric te d P a y m e n ts ' or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Parent Guarantor. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Parent Guarantor may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer's Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption ``-- R e s tric te d P a y m e n ts " . If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Exchange Notes Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption ``--In c u r r e n c e o f In d e b te d n e s s a n d Is s u a n c e o f P re fe rre d S to c k " , the Parent Guarantor will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; p ro v id e d that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption ``--In c u r r e n c e o f In d e b te d n e s s a n d Is s u a n c e o f P r e fe r r e d S to c k " , calculated on a p r o fo rm a basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
