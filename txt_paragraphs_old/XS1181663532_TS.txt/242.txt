Gross operating earnings (operating earnings before depreciation, restructuring expenses, other gains and losses and impairments) were NOK 1,485 million in 2012 compared to NOK 1,515 million in 2011, a decrease of 2.0%. As a percentage of operating revenue, gross operating earnings increased from 8.0% of operating revenue in 2011 to 9.0% of operating revenue in 2012. The lower gross operating earnings in 2012 were primarily due to weaker pricing for certain of our newsprint operations.
--E u ro p e . Gross operating earnings from our Newsprint segment in Europe were NOK 365 million in 2012 compared to NOK 387 million in 2011, a decrease of 5.7%, principally due to weaker newsprint sales pricing from our Golbey mill and the reclassification of our Parenco mill operations within our Magazine Paper segment. As a percentage of segment operating revenues, gross operating earnings from our European Newsprint segment increased from 6.4% of operating revenues in 2011 to 8.1% of operating revenues in 2012 as a result of improvements in employee expenses and lower per unit costs of materials (fiber and energy) in Europe.
-- O u ts id e E u ro p e . Gross operating earnings from our Newsprint segment outside Europe were NOK 879 million in 2012 and NOK 915 million in 2011, a decrease of 3.9%, principally due to the sale of our Bio Bio operations in Chile and weaker pricing for sales of newsprint from our Tasman operations. As a percentage of segment operating revenue, gross operating earnings of our non-European Newsprint segment increased from 16.1% in 2011 to 16.7% in 2012, which reflected the generally improved pricing for non-European newsprint sales, which were offset by higher per unit material (energy and wood) and per unit distribution costs.
M a g a z in e P a p e r. Gross operating earnings of our Magazine Paper segment were NOK 349 million in 2012 and NOK 291 million in 2011, an increase of 19.9%, reflecting contributions from Saugbrugs following the fire in 2011 which more than offset the negative impacts of the Follum mill closure and reclassification of the Parenco operations within our Magazine Paper segment. As a percentage of segment operating revenues, gross operating earnings from our Magazine Paper segment increased to 5.6% of operating revenues in 2012 from 4.6% of operating revenues in 2011. The increase in gross operating earnings relative to operating revenue reflected the reduced per units costs of wood and energy for our Magazine Paper operations in 2012, which were offset by slightly reduced pricing for magazine paper over the same period.
O th e r A c tiv itie s . Gross operating earnings from our Other Activities segment were negative NOK 116 million in 2012 and NOK 95 million in 2011, primarily due to higher costs for corporate functions, including costs in connection with the relocation of the former head office.

Depreciation
Depreciation decreased by 43.6% to NOK 935 million in 2012 compared to NOK 1,658 million in 2011. As a percentage of operating revenue, depreciation decreased from 8.8% of operating revenue in 2011 to 5.6% of operating revenue in 2012. The decrease in depreciation expense in 2012 was primarily due to NOK 1,969 million of impairment charges recorded in 2011.
