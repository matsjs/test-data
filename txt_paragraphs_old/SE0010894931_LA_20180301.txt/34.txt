The Issuer will make the following information available to the Bondholders by way of press release and by publication on the website of the Group:
(b) as soon as the same become available, but in any event within two (2) months after the end of each quarter of each financial year, the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Group and the unconsolidated financial statements of the Issuer or the year-end report (bokslutskommunike) (as applicable) for such period prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles; and
(c) any other information required by the Swedish Securities Markets Act (lag (2007:582) om vardepappersmarknaden) and the rules and regulations of the Regulated Market on which the Bonds are admitted to trading;
(d) as soon as practicable following a cancellation of Bonds by the Issuer, the Total Nominal Amount.
The Issuer shall immediately notify the Bondholders and the Agent upon becoming aware of the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, a Delisting Event or a Listing Failure. A notice may be given in advance of the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, conditioned upon the occurrence of such Change of Control Event, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for a Change of Control Event.
When the financial statements and other information are made available to the Bondholders pursuant to Clause 10.1.1, the Issuer shall send copies of such financial statements and other information to the Agent. Together with the financial statements, the Issuer shall submit to the Agent a Compliance Certificate. The Compliance Certificate shall for the purpose of confirming that the financial undertakings set out in Clause 12 (Financial Undertakings) have been met, include figures and the basis on which the Equity Ratio and the Interest Coverage Ratio have been calculated. Such Compliance Certificate shall also be delivered by the Issuer to the Agent within 30 calendar days of the Agent's reasonably request.
The Issuer shall immediately notify the Agent (with full particulars) upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any event or circumstance which constitutes an Event of Default, or any event or circumstance which would (with the expiry of a grace period, the giving of notice, the making of any determination or any combination of any of the foregoing) constitute an Event of Default, and shall provide the Agent with such further information as it may reasonably request in writing following receipt of such notice. Should the Agent not receive such information, the Agent is entitled to assume that no such event or circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Agent does not have actual knowledge of such event or circumstance.
