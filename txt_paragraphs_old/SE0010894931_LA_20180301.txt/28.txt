INTEREST
Each Initial Bond carries Interest at the Interest Rate calculated on the Nominal Amount
from (but excluding) the First Issue Date up to (and including) the relevant Redemption
Date. Any Subsequent Bond will carry Interest at the Interest Rate calculated on the
Nominal Amount from (but excluding) the Interest Payment Date falling immediately prior
to its issuance up to (and including) the relevant Redemption Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, interest under these Terms and Conditions shall never be calculated as being an
amount less than zero (0).
