By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Bondholder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Bondholder confirms such agreement.
Provided that no Event of Default is continuing or would result following the expiry of a grace period, the giving of notice, the making of any determination (or any combination of the foregoing) or from such issue, the Issuer may, at one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Bonds. Subsequent Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate, the Nominal Amount and the Final Maturity Date applicable to the Initial Bonds shall apply to Subsequent Bonds. The price of the Subsequent Bonds may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal Amount. Each Subsequent Bond shall entitle its
9 (33)
holder to Interest in accordance with Clause 8.1, and otherwise have the same rights as the Initial Bonds.
2.5
The Bonds constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of
the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu and without any preference among them,
and at least pari passu with all other direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured
obligations of the Issuer other than those mandatorily preferred by law.
