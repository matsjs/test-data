10.4 Non-listing Put Option
Upon the occurrence of a Non-listing Put Option Event, each Bondholder shall have the
right to require that the Issuer redeems its Bonds (a "Non-listing Put Option") at a
price of 101% of par value (plus accrued and unpaid interest), provided that no such
put option have effect if, in the reasonable opinion of the Bond Trustee, the failure to
list the Bonds is due to circumstances outside the control of the Issuer and which the
Issuer could not reasonably be expected to avoid or overcome.
(b)
The Non-listing Put Option must be exercised within fifteen (15) days after the Issuer
