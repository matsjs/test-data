The Bondholders' Meeting represents the supreme authority of the Bondholders
decisions altering the terms and conditions of the Bonds, including, but not limited to,
any reduction of principal or interest and any conversion of the Bonds into other
capital classes.
(b)
The Bondholders' Meeting cannot resolve that any overdue payment of any instalment
shall be reduced unless there is a pro rata reduction of the principal that has not fallen
due, but may resolve that accrued interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced
without a corresponding reduction of principal.
