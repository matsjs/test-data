12.1 Guarantee and indemnity (a) Each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally:
(i) guarantees to the Bond Trustee punctual performance by each Obligor of all that Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;
(ii) undertakes with the Bond Trustee that whenever an Obligor does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document, the Guarantor shall immediately on demand (Nw. pakravsgaranti) pay that amount, and the Guarantor shall have no right of defence, reservation or objection to such demand for payment by the Bond Trustee and no conflict or dispute of whatsoever nature between the Bond Trustee and the Obligors shall have an impact on the Guarantor's obligation to pay under the guarantee set out in this Clause 12 (Guarantee); and
(iii) agrees with the Bond Trustee that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify the Bond Trustee immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as a result of an Obligor not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been
30/55
payable by it under any Finance Document on the date when it would have been due. The amount payable by the Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the amount it would have had to pay under this Clause 12 (Guarantee) if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a guarantee.
12.2 Continuing guarantee This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by the Obligors under the Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
12.3 Reinstatement If any discharge, release or arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations of an Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by the Bond Trustee in whole or in part on the basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored in insolvency, liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then the liability of each Guarantor under this Clause 12 (Guarantee) will continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.
