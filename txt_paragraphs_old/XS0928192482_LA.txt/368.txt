> it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether under Italian law a security can be created and perfected (i) in favor of creditors which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a trustee in respect of notes on behalf of the noteholders, since there is no established concept of ``trust'' or ``trustee'' under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a trustee as agent or trustee for holders of the notes under security interests on Italian assets is debatable under Italian law;
> in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the subject matter of the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas or shares.

Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer
Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called "claw-back" or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise to the revocation, inter alia, of payments or grants of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions include transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy in comparison to the rules applicable in the United States and the United Kingdom. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner.
Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant obligor enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the collateral and the guarantees or the parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such obligor under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the "suspect period"). The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby the creditor must prove his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any claw back action during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm's length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the bankruptcy trustee must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to enforce any claw back action. If challenged successfully, the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.
Please also note that, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (referred to as "privilegiati") are given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor's property in respect to the claims of other creditors. Such claims are classified either as (i) general privileges or liens (privilegi generali) which apply only in respect of all personal property of the debtor, or (ii) special privileges or liens (privilegi speciali), which apply only in respect of particular (immovable or movable) property of the debtor. Some of these claims have statutory priority and would therefore be preferred to the claims of the holders of the Additional Notes in case of insolvency proceeding. Such claims include, for example, courts costs, mandatory social security contributions and credits of the government for taxes.
In any case, it should be noted that: (i) under article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions for no consideration are ineffective vis-a-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration, and (ii) under article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-a-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency.
