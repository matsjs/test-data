(ii) the Net Cash Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "all or substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person.

Impairment of Security Interests
The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Liens with respect to the Collateral in favor of the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes (the "Security Interest") (it being understood that, subject to the paragraph below, the incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall not be deemed to materially impair the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral) and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below), any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral (except Permitted Collateral Liens).
Notwithstanding the foregoing (a) nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any Security Interest in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement or the Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) the Security Interest and the related Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) if, contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Security Agent, either: (1) a solvency opinion in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an independent financial advisor, accounting firm, appraiser or investment bank of international standing which confirms the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, replacement, supplement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets); (2) a certificate from the board of directors or officer of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Security Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, replacement, supplement, modification or release; or (3) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, replacement, supplement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or released and replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement.
In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release and replacement without the need for instructions from the holders of the Notes.
