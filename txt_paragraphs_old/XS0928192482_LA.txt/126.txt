Employee benefits
Employee benefits decreased by 13.0 million, or 5.8%, to 209.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to 222.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease primarily resulted from lower wage costs due to reduced headcount in manufacturing and logistics and in several support functions, as well as the divestment of Leda in 2012.

This decrease primarily resulted from a reduction in sales and marketing costs due to improvements in the centralization and efficiency of our marketing strategy (involving a common product launch approach and common web development).
