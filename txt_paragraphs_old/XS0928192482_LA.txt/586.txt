The management of the Group actively monitors and evaluates such factors to respond appropriately when required.
Under the related party loans the Group has to pay a fixed interest rate until December 31, 2011. After that the interest rate is based on euribor added with margin and thus the Group is exposed to interest rate risk, which will be managed in line with the Group Treasury policy.
