Permitted payments Prior to an acceleration event or enforcement of the Collateral, the Intercreditor Agreement will permit payments to be made by the Debtors under the Revolving Facility Agreement, the Indenture and any Pari Passu Debt documentation (provided that such payments are permitted under such documents) and does not limit or restrict any payment by any Debtor in the ordinary course of business. The Intercreditor Agreement also permits payments to lenders of Intra-Group Liabilities, provided that there has been no acceleration or enforcement of the Collateral. Payments may be made in respect of Structural Liabilities to the extent not prohibited by the Revolving Facility Agreement, the Indenture and the Pari Passu Debt documentation. There are also restrictions on payments to Hedge Counterparties except for certain specified permitted payments.
The Debtors may no longer make payments in respect of the Credit Facilities Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities or the Pari Passu Debt after an acceleration event or enforcement of the Collateral unless in accordance with the enforcement proceeds waterfall described below under "--Application o fproceeds."
An acceleration event includes the relevant creditor representative exercising any or all of its rights under the acceleration provisions of the Revolving Facility Agreement (which includes placing on demand of liabilities thereunder), the Indenture or the Pari Passu Debt documentation.

The giving of this notice triggers a 20-day consultation period during which time the creditor representatives for each of the creditor classes must discuss the proposals in good faith with a view to co-ordinating the proposed instructions.
A creditor representative is not obliged to consult as described above (or shall only be obliged to consult for a shorter period) if:
> the Collateral has become enforceable as a result of a bankruptcy event;
> the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as defined below) or the Majority Senior Creditors (as defined below) determine in good faith, that to do so and thereby delay enforcement could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (A) the Security Agent's ability to enforce any of the Collateral or (B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the Collateral in any material respect; or
