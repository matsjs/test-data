So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or their respective nominees) will be considered the holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.
DEFINITIVE REGISTERED NOTES Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered form (the "Definitive Registered Notes"): > if Euroclear and Clearstream notify the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a successor
depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or > if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture.
In such an event, the registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream or the Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in "Notice to investors'' unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.
REDEMPTION OF GLOBAL NOTES In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants' accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than 100,000 principal amount at maturity, or less, may be redeemed in part.

PAYMENTS ON GLOBAL NOTES Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest, additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the principal paying agent. The principal paying agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.
Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (i.e., Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer nor the Trustee or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for: > any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on
account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; > payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or > Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.
