16. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Sanitec financial risk management is conducted according to the Treasury Policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors. The objective of treasury is to secure sufficient funding for operational needs, to provide financial services to Group companies, to minimize the costs of financing, to manage financial risks (currency, interest rate, liquidity and funding, credit and operational treasury risks) and to provide to the management relevant information on the financial position and risk exposures of Sanitec. The Group companies are responsible for hedging their financial risks according to the Treasury Policy and instructions from Group Treasury.
Liquidity risk
Management aims to maintain an optimal amount of liquidity to fund the business operations of the Group at all times while minimizing interest costs. Liquidity is considered to be the sum of cash and cash equivalents and available committed credit facilities. As of the end of the year 2012, cash and cash equivalents amounted to 215.7 million (161.3 million) and the aggregate of unutilized overdraft facility was 0.3 million (0.5 million). In addition, Sanitec group has access to a committed  50 million revolving credit facility, which was unutilized both at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Further information on credit facilities is given in note 15 Loans and interest bearing liabilities.
Credit risk
Group Treasury evaluates and monitors financial counterparty risk. The Group minimizes this risk by limiting its counterparties to a limited number of major banks and financial institutions, by monitoring their performance, and by working within agreed counterparty limits.
