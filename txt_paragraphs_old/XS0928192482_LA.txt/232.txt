(d) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to an individual that are required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive;
(e) Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner of Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;
(f) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to, the Notes or with respect to any Guarantee;
(g) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of Notes, following the Issuer's written request addressed to the holder or beneficial owner (and made at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request), to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;
(h) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors to the holder if such holder is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had such holder been the sole beneficial owner of such Note;
(i) any withholding or deduction required to be made from a payment pursuant to sections 1471-1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as of the issue date (or any amended or successor version), and any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing or any agreements entered into pursuant to section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or
(j) any combination of items (a) through (i) above.
In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, will also pay and indemnify the holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Guarantee or any other document referred to therein (other than a transfer of Notes other than the initial resale by the initial purchasers), or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, (limited, solely in the case of taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (a) through (e), (g) or (h) above or any combination thereof), or any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Notes or any Guarantee.
If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, each of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer's Certificate(s) must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the paying agents to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
