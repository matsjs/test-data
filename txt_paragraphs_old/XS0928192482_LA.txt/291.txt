(a) if the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has incurred any Debt since the beginning of such period that remains outstanding or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is an incurrence of Debt or both, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Net Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after giving effect on a pro forma basis to such Debt as if such Debt had been incurred on the first day of such period and the discharge of any other Debt repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged with the proceeds of such new Debt as if such discharge had occurred on the first day of such period; provided however, that the pro forma calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall not give effect to (i) any Debt incurred on the date of determination pursuant to the provisions described in clause (2) under the caption "--Certain covenants--Limitation on Debt" or (ii) the discharge on the date of determination of any Debt to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds incurred pursuant to the provisions described in clause (2) under the caption "-- Certain covenants--Limitation on Debt;"
(c) if, since the beginning of such period, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or otherwise) shall have made an Investment in any Restricted Subsidiary (or any Person which becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) or an acquisition of assets, including any acquisition of an asset occurring in connection with a transaction causing a calculation to be made hereunder, which constitutes all or substantially all of an operating unit of a business, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Net Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (including the incurrence of any Debt) as if such Investment or acquisition occurred on the first day of such period; and
(d) if, since the beginning of such period, any Person (that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period) shall have made any Asset Sale or any Investment or acquisition of assets that would have required an adjustment pursuant to clause (b) or (c) above if made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary during such period, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Net Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Asset Sale or Investment or acquisition occurred on the first day of such period.
If any Debt bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest expense on such Debt shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Debt for a period equal to the remaining term of such Interest Rate Agreement).
For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Income Taxes, Consolidated Net Interest Expense and Consolidated Adjusted Net Income, calculations will be as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer.
"Consolidated Leverage" means, with respect to any Person, the sum of the aggregate outstanding Debt of that Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries and the aggregate liquidation preference of any preferred equity issued by a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, as of the relevant date of calculation.
"Consolidated Leverage Ratio" of the Issuer means, as of the date of determination, the ratio of (a) the Consolidated Leverage of the Issuer to (b) the aggregate Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the period of the most recent four consecutive quarters for which financial statements are available; provided that the pro forma calculation of Consolidated Leverage shall not give effect to
