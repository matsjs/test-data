Leasing agreements
Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and rewards, are classified as operating leases. Rental payments under operating leases are recognized as expenses when incurred.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or average cost method for finished goods and the average cost method for raw materials. Cost includes direct manufacturing, labor and materials, variable overhead and allocable portion of production and project administration overheads. Costs associated with assets produced for internal use are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

Financial assets and liabilities
Financial instruments are classified in accordance with the IAS 39 to the following groups: financial assets at the fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets and loans and receivables. Sanitec has no held-to-maturity investments as of the financial year-end date.
Financial assets at the fair value through profit or loss contain liquid instruments such as commercial papers and derivative assets that do not qualify as hedges in accordance with IAS 39 hedge accounting.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. In Sanitec this group contains trade receivables and other loan receivables arising from commercial operations and other current investments such as bank deposits. These items are reported as current or non-current in the balance sheet depending on their maturity. All items in this class are originally measured at cost and provisions for impairments are established, where there is objective evidence that Sanitec cannot collect all amounts due according to the original terms of loans and receivables.
