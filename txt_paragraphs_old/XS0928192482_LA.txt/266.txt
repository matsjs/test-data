(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma basis, no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing;
(d) Except to the extent any Liens are amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or otherwise released and retaken in accordance with the second paragraph of the "Impairment of Security Interests" covenant, the Liens on the Collateral will remain in full force and effect securing the Notes and the Guarantees, as applicable; and
(e) the Issuer or the Surviving Entity will have delivered to the Trustee, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with this covenant.
A Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Guarantee and the Indenture as described under "--The Guarantees") will not, directly or indirectly (other than in connection with a transaction that does not constitute an Asset Sale or a transaction that is permitted by the covenant described under the caption "--Limitation on the sale of certain assets"): (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation), or (2) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of such Guarantor and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:
(a) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and
(b) either:
(i) the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee, the Indenture and the Security Documents to which such Guarantor is a party pursuant to a supplemental indenture reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and to the Security Agent; or
(ii) the Net Cash Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture.
Nothing in the Indenture will prevent and this covenant will not apply to (i) any Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with, merging into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or (iii) the Issuer from consolidating with, merging into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Guarantor. In addition, clause (c) above will not apply to any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of the Issuer with or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction for tax reasons.
