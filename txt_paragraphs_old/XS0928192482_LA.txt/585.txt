EVALUATION OF MARKET RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
In the process of production, distribution, sales and marketing of bathroom ceramics and bath and shower products the Group is subject to customary market risks, which relate to the supply of materials, demand of products, competition, legal environment and other such factors beyond control of the Group. The management of the Group actively monitors and evaluates such factors to respond appropriately when required.
The main borrowings of the Group are related party loans from Sofia IV S.a r.l., who has borrowed from Sofia III S.a r.l., who in turn has borrowed under a senior credit facility. The related party loans of Sanitec Group and Sofia IV S.a r.l. are linked to the terms and conditions of the senior credit facility taken by Sofia III S.a r.l. This senior credit facility is subject to regularly reported restrictive covenants but according to the credit facility agreement, the covenant restrictions, excluding the liquidity covenant, are not applicable before September 30, 2011. Thus, a negative development of profitability or cash flow may restrict the debt service capability of the Group or may restrict the Group from meeting the covenants in the future.
