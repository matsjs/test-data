Net sales in ceramics sanitaryware totalled 546.5 million and sales in ceramics complementary products totalled 206.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to 551.7 million and 219.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Sales in ceramics sanitaryware remained relatively stable primarily due to the combination of a continued strong average selling price and adjustments to our product mix towards products with a higher average selling price, which was offset by lower volumes driven by weak markets in South Europe and the exiting of unprofitable businesses in the United Kingdom and France. The main areas of growth were North Europe and East Europe (Russia and Ukraine in particular) with volumes, average selling price and product mix effects showing positive momentum compared to the prior year. Net sales of ceramics complementary products decreased for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to the divestment of Leda; a decline in shower sales, primarily in Central Europe; and generally lower ceramics sanitaryware volumes, which resulted in lower sales of bundled ceramics sanitaryware products. This was partially offset by growth in net sales of ceramics complementary products in our East Europe and Rest of World regions.
Other operating income
Other operating income decreased by 4.0 million, or 42.6%, to 5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to 9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease primarily resulted from a lower gain from sales of assets as well as lower income from the re-invoicing of transportation and marketing costs and similar items related to our sales.
Materials and services
Materials and services decreased by 5.5 million, or 1.6%, to 344.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to 349.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease primarily resulted from purchasing initiatives and increased sourcing from low-cost facilities, as well as the divestment of Leda during 2012, which resulted in lower purchases of aluminium. The decrease also resulted from an overall decrease in volumes.
