Research and development costs are normally expensed as other operating expenses for the financial year they incur. If the criteria for commercial and technical feasibility in accordance with IAS 38 have been met, development costs are capitalized and amortized during the expected economic life of the underlying technology.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. Land and water areas are not depreciated.
Depreciation on plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets according to plan as follows:
Buildings.................................................................................................................................... Heavy production machinery and equipment........................................................................ Light production machinery and equipment......................................................................... Other machinery and equipment............................................................................................. Land............................................................................................................................................
20--40 years 10--20 years
8--10 years 3--5 years
No depreciation
Expected useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date and if they differ significantly from previous estimates, the remaining depreciation periods are changed accordingly.
Subsequent improvement costs related to an asset are included in the carrying value of such asset or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when future economic benefits associated with the costs are probable and the related costs can be separated from normal maintenance costs. Regular maintenance costs are recognized as expenses for the period.
