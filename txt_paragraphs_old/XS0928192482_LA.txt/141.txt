Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011
Our net working capital decreased by 11.8 million, or 28.3%, to 29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to 41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This change primarily resulted from lower sales in the last quarter of 2012, leading to lower receivables compared with the prior year.
Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010
Our net working capital decreased by 5.8 million, or 12.2%, to 41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Liquidity arrangements
Liquidity is considered to be the sum of cash and cash equivalents and available committed credit lines. As of December 31, 2012, the aggregate of the unutilized committed revolving credit facility was 50.0 million (at parent company level available for the company to use) and cash and cash equivalents amounted to 215.7 million. We seek to manage liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash and available funding.
Following the completion of this Offering, our primary sources of liquidity will remain cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility in addition to cash on our balance sheet. Our ability to meet future working capital, capital expenditure and restructuring and debt service requirements will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control.
