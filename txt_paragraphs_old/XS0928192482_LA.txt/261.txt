(b) pay any Debt owed to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;
(d) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;
provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill period to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Debt incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.
(2) The provisions of the covenant described in paragraph (1) above will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:
(a) the Notes (including Additional Notes), the Indenture, the Revolving Facility Agreement and the security documents related thereto or by other indentures or agreements governing other Debt incurred by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary ranking equally with the Notes; provided that the encumbrances or restrictions imposed by such other indentures or agreements are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than the encumbrances or restrictions imposed by the Indenture;
(b) any agreements with respect to Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of "--Limitation on Debt," and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that such encumbrances or restrictions are not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the holders of the Notes than is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the board of directors or a member of senior management of the Issuer);
(c) any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the board of directors or a member of senior management of the Issuer);
(d) customary non-assignment and similar provisions in contracts, leases and licenses entered into in the ordinary course of business;
(e) any agreement or other instrument of a Person (including its Subsidiaries), acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in effect at the time of such acquisition (but not created in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired (including its Subsidiaries);
