Limitation on transactions with Affiliates
(a) such transaction or series of transactions is on terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could have been obtained in a comparable arm's length transaction with third parties that are not Affiliates (as determined in good faith by the board of directors or a member of senior management of the Issuer);
(b) with respect to any transaction or series of related transactions involving aggregate payments or the transfer of assets or provision of services, in each case having a value greater than 10.0 million, the Issuer will deliver a resolution of its board of directors (set out in an Officer's Certificate to the Trustee) certifying that such transaction complies with clause (a) above; and
(c) with respect to any transaction or series of related transactions involving aggregate payments or the transfer of assets or the provision of services, in each case having a value greater than 25.0 million, the Issuer will obtain a written opinion of an accounting, appraisal, investment banking or advisory firm of international standing, or other recognized independent expert of international standing with experience appraising the terms and conditions of the type of transaction or series of related transactions for which an opinion is required, stating that the transaction or series of transactions is (i) fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this description will not apply to:
(i) customary directors' fees, indemnification and similar arrangements (including the payment of directors' and officers' insurance premiums), consulting fees, employee salaries, bonuses, employment agreements and arrangements, compensation or employee benefit arrangements, including stock options or legal fees (as determined in good faith by the board of directors or a member of senior management of the Issuer);
(ii) any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement, consultant, employee benefit arrangements with any employee, consultant, officer or director of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, including under any stock option, stock appreciation rights, stock incentive or similar plans, entered into in the ordinary course of business;
(iii) any Restricted Payments not prohibited by the "--Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant and Permitted Investments; provided that, in the case of a Permitted Investment described in clause (c)(iii) of the definition thereof, such Permitted Investment shall be in accordance with clause (a) of the first paragraph of this covenant;
(iv) transactions pursuant to, or contemplated by any agreement or arrangement in effect on the Issue Date and transactions pursuant to any amendment, modification, supplement or extension thereto; provided that any such amendment, modification, supplement or extension to the terms thereof is not more materially more disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes than the original agreement or arrangement as in effect on the Issue Date;
