Conflicting enforcement instructions
At the end of the consultation period, the Security Agent must act on the instructions of the Instructing Group.

Failure by a class of creditors to give instructions will be deemed to be an instruction that conflicts with any other enforcement instructions. After the Security Agent has commenced enforcement over the Collateral, it will not accept any subsequent instructions from anyone other than the Instructing Group that instructed it to take such action, except as described in the paragraph below.

Any enforcement instructions given must comply with certain security enforcement principles and the security enforcement objective, including the following:
