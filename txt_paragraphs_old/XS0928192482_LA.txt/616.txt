Operating segments
Sanitec Group has only one segment and does not report any segment information in the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currency transactions
The financial statements are presented in Euros, which is the parent company's functional currency and presentation currency of the Group. Items included in the financial statements of each Group's subsidiary are measured by using the currency of the financial environment, where the subsidiary operates.
Transactions in the foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of transaction. At the end of financial period, the unsettled balances denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the rates prevailing at the reporting date. Exchange gains and losses arising from the transactions in foreign currencies and translation of monetary items are recognized in the profit or loss.
On consolidation, the profit or loss statements of the foreign subsidiaries are translated into Euros by using the average exchange rate for the accounting period. The balance sheets are translated at the yearend exchange rate. Differences resulting from the translation of profit or loss statement and balance sheets are recorded in the other comprehensive income as translation differences.
