Interest rate risks arise due to interest rate fluctuations, which may increase the borrowing costs of the Group. Sanitec may enter into derivative contracts to reduce these risks. Until the end of 2011 the related party loans had fixed interest rates. As of the end of the year, the Group held no interest rate derivative contracts.
