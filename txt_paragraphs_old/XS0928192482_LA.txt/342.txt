Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-equity-swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt-to-equity swap.
Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-a-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately.
Under the German Insolvency Code, an insolvency administrator may also challenge transactions which are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. The administrator's right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings.
In the event such a transaction is successfully voided, the Security Agent and/or the holders of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received under the guarantees to the insolvency estate or to waive the guarantees or for the benefit of any security interest and would have a claim solely under the Notes.
In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschaft) (which includes the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be voided in the following cases:
> any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) or satisfaction of a debt if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfahig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor's illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing);
> any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) or satisfaction of a debt to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing; (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time; or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental effect);
> any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition of the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor's illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction;
