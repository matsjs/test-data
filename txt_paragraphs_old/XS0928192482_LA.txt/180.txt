Ceramics complementary products
Our ceramics complementary product range includes showers, baths, furniture, pre-wall systems, taps and mixers. We sell our ceramics complementary products in the same markets and under the same brands as our ceramics sanitaryware products. We also sell shower and shower-related products such as cubicles, enclosures, columns and non-ceramics trays, as well as solid surface materials for use in sanitary fittings and other applications, under the Koralle and Varicor brands, respectively. In 2012, ceramics complementary products accounted for approximately 27.4% of our net sales.
Distribution and customers
We sell to most of the key distributors in our different core markets, and some of those customers are parts of multi-national customer groups. In 2012, the aggregated sales of the top 10 and 20 customer groups accounted for approximately 47.6% and 59.4%, respectively, of our net sales. In practice, commercial and business relationships are managed on an individual market and business-unit level, so counterparty risk is significantly lower. We sell more than 80% of our bathroom fixtures to wholesalers; we also sell all bathroom fixtures through retailers (including DIY outlets) and installers in our core markets. Except for sales to customers in the Baltics, Denmark and Italy, where sales are conducted through agents, sales within our key markets are conducted by our Group companies. In addition, we have sales offices in Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and China. Sales outside these markets, or where we do not have our own sales offices, are made through agents or distributors in such countries.
