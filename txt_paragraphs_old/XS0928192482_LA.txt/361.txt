The NBU, in order to decide whether to issue an individual licence, may request any documents that it considers necessary, based on which it will assess the payments to be made by the surety and their nature, including from the perspective of mandatory provisions and concepts of Ukrainian law. The concept of "indemnity" is not expressly recognized under Ukrainian law, and with respect to various indemnities set out in the suretyships as well as other similar payment obligations of sureties throughout suretyships to reimburse, compensate or otherwise indemnify the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes on for various other fees, costs, expenses, taxes, charges, duties and other similar provisions, it is uncertain whether the NBU will consider them in line with Ukrainian law for the purposes of issuing an individual licence, and consequently whether the sureties will be able to make such payments to the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes.

Moratorium on satisfaction o f creditors 'claims. After any bankruptcy proceeding is commenced, the Ukrainian court imposes a moratorium on claims of creditors which became payable prior to the moratorium introduction. During the term of such moratorium, the relevant surety would be unable to make payments to the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes, and the Noteholders' claims against such surety would not be enforceable in Ukraine. Such surety may not be held liable in Ukraine for the non-performance of its obligations to the holders of the Notes resulting from the imposition of the moratorium. Upon the termination of the moratorium (other than as a result of a surety entering bankruptcy proceedings), the Noteholders would be entitled to make, and to enforce, claims against the relevant Surety in the amounts existing as of the date when the moratorium was imposed.

Invalidation o f agreements or property related acts. Further, according to Article 20 of the Law of Ukraine "On Restoring Debtor Solvency or Declaring Bankruptcy" agreements or property related acts of a debtor performed by the debtor after commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding or within one year that precedes the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding may be invalidated by the commercial court within the scope of insolvency proceedings filed by a receiver or a creditor on the following grounds: (i) the debtor disposes property on a free-of-charge basis, assumes an obligation without any property related acts being performed by the other party, waives his own property claims; (ii) the debtor performs property related obligations in advance of the prescribed term; (iii) the debtor, prior to the institution of the bankruptcy case, assumes an obligation and, as a result, becomes insolvent or the performance of his payment obligations to other creditors becomes impossible, in full or in part; (iv) the debtor disposes or purchases property at prices that are lower or higher than the market, provided that at the time when he assumes the obligation (or as a result of performing the same) the debtor's property is (becomes) insufficient to satisfy the creditors' claims; (v) the debtor pays a creditor or accepts property towards performance of monetary claims on the day when total creditors' claims to the debtor exceed the value of the property; and (vi) the debtor assumes security obligations in order to secure the performance of monetary claims.
Invalidation of agreements or property related acts of the debtor is initiated by the receiver appointed by the court to carry out any acts aimed at the financial rehabilitation of the debtor or the debtor's creditor and must be confirmed by a court'sjudgement. Where agreements or property related acts of the debtor are invalidated on the grounds provided above the creditor shall return the property that the creditor received from the debtor to the bankruptcy estate.
If the respective Deed of Surety were to be declared invalid on any of the above grounds, the holders of the Notes would be required to repay to the relevant Ukrainian Surety all funds received pursuant to the respective Deed of Surety. There is a lack of certainty as to whether, in such event, the court might impose other requirements as a result of the invalidity. In light of the risks associated with the Ukrainian legal system no assurance can be given as to how the courts in Ukraine would react in the event of the respective surety being invalidated.
Subordination. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of a Surety, the Noteholders' claims would be treated as claims of unsecured creditors and the Ukrainian Surety's obligations to Noteholders would be subordinated to the following obligations: > obligations secured by a pledge or mortgage over the assets of the Ukrainian Surety; > severance pay and employment related obligations; > expenditures associated with the conduct of the bankruptcy proceedings and expenses of the liquidator; > obligations arising as a result of causing death or damage to health; > workplace injury compensation;
> local and state taxes and other mandatory payments (including mandatory pension and social security contributions); and > expenditures associated with ecological damage prevention measures during bankruptcy proceedings incurred by the competent
