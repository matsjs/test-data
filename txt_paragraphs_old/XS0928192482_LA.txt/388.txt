OUTLOOK FOR 2013 The macroeconomic uncertainties emerging during the third quarter 2011 continued throughout 2012 with varying impacts in different European markets. The challenges experienced by the financial markets in Europe are creating continued uncertainty in the market and it is difficult to estimate what the direct and indirect implications of this will be.
The Group will continue measures to simplify the Group legal structure, started in 2010. The main purpose is to align the legal structure with commercial structure, reduce complexity and improve efficiency in the administrative processes.
