(3) Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds (including cash or Cash Equivalents received from the conversion of any securities, notes or other obligations), the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.
(4) Any Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in clause (2) of this covenant will constitute "Excess Proceeds." The Issuer may also at any time, and the Issuer will within ten Business Days after the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds 20.0 million, make an offer to purchase (an "Excess Proceeds Offer") from all holders of Notes and from the holders of any Pari Passu Debt, to the extent required by the terms thereof, on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing any such Pari Passu Debt, the maximum principal amount (expressed as a multiple of 1,000) of the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt that may be purchased with the amount of the Excess Proceeds (plus in each case all accrued interest on the Debt and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith). The offer price as to each Note and any such Pari Passu Debt will be payable in cash in an amount equal to (solely in the case of the Notes) 100% of the principal amount of such Note and (solely in the case of Pari Passu Debt) no greater than 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such Pari Passu Debt, plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption.
To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt tendered pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer (or applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to purchase Notes and Pari Passu Debt for general corporate purposes that are not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt to be purchased will be selected by the Trustee on a pro rata basis (based upon the principal amount of Notes and the principal amount or accreted value of such Pari Passu Debt tendered by each holder) or in the manner described under "--Selection and notice." Upon completion of each such Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero.
(5) If the Issuer is obligated to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will purchase the Notes and Pari Passu Debt, at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part in integral multiples of 1,000, on a date that is not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days from the date the notice of the Excess Proceeds Offer is given to such holders, or such later date as may be required under the Exchange Act; provided that no Note of less than 100,000 remains outstanding thereafter.
(6) If the Issuer is required to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with such securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations described in this covenant by virtue thereof.
