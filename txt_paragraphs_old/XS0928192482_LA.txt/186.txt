Since 2009, we have not experienced any material labor strikes or lockouts, other than a strike of employees working at our factory in Selles-sur-Cher in 2010 in connection with its closure and national strikes that are not related to our business. Our industrial relations are primarily handled at the local level. We consider our relations with our employees and their unions to be satisfactory. We are, in the ordinary course of business, occasionally party to disputes with employees mainly relating to claims of wrongful dismissal. For a description of pending claims and disputes with employees, see "--Legal proceedings." Generally, our companies engaged in production, as well as a few additional entities, have entered into and comply with local collective bargaining agreements.
