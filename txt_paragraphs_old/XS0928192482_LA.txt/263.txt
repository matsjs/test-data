(k) Purchase Money Obligations and mortgage financings for property acquired in the ordinary course of business and Capitalized Lease Obligations that impose restrictions on the property purchased or leased of the nature described in clause (1)(d) of the preceding paragraph;
(m) any agreement that extends, renews, amends, modifies, restates, supplements, refunds, refinances or replaces the agreements containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing clauses (2)(a) through (l), or in this clause (2)(m); provided that the terms and conditions of any such encumbrances or restrictions are not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the holders of the Notes than those under or pursuant to the agreement so extended, renewed, amended, modified, restated, supplemented, refunded, refinanced or replaced (as determined in good faith by the board of directors or a member of senior management of the Issuer).
Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries
(1) The board of directors of the Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as Unrestricted will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption "-- Limitation on Restricted Payments" or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The board of directors of the Issuer may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.
(2) Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a certified copy of a resolution of the board of directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer's Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption "--Limitation on Restricted Payments." If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Debt of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date and, if such Debt is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption "--Limitation on Debt," the Issuer will be in default of such covenant. The board of directors of the Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Debt by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Debt of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Debt is permitted under the covenant described under the caption "--Limitation on Debt," calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
