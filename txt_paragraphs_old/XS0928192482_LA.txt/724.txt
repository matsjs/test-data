Foreign exchange tran slation exposu re arises when the equity of a subsidiary is denominated in currency other than the functional currency of the parent company. Sanitec is not applying hedge accounting to equity exposures. The translation of subsidiaries' balance sheet into euro caused translation differences of -3.1 million from year 2010 to 2011 and from year 2009 to 2010 6.3 million to equity.
Economic exposure related to foreign exchange rates means the risk of deteriorating competitive situation due to exchange rate movements, or in other words the economic effect of the currency of costs and revenues affecting both Sanitec and its competitors. The Group is currently not hedging itself for these risks, but might use currency derivatives as hedges.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risks arise due to interest rate fluctuations, which may increase the borrowing costs of the Group. Sanitec may enter into derivative contracts to reduce these risks. Until the end of 2011 the related party loans had fixed interest rates. As of the end of the year, the Group held no interest rate derivative contracts.
