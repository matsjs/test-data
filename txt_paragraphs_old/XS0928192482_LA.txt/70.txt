If we do not adapt to changes in distribution channels in some of our markets, our sales volume and profitability may be adversely affected.
The wholesale channel in many of the markets in which we operate is also currently undergoing consolidation which may lead to a concentration of our customer base. In addition, there has been a trend towards increasing wholesale purchasing power through the formation of buying groups. Many of our customers have also demonstrated an increased focus on working capital management and inventory reduction which has, and may continue to, impact our sales. Finally, we have also seen some growth in internet-only sales channels in certain markets. As a result of all of these factors, we may face decreased sales volumes and increased price pressure, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are exposed to local business risks in many different countries.
We operate in several countries outside of our core Western European markets, in particular in East Europe. A portion of our sales and manufacturing operations are conducted in these countries. Further, our main suppliers of ready-made ceramics sanitaryware products are located in Egypt, Turkey and China.
Our business is subject to risks resulting from differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements, economic conditions and unforeseeable developments in a variety ofjurisdictions, including in emerging markets. These risks include, among other things:
> political instability;
> differing economic cycles and adverse economic conditions;
> disruption of our operations;
> unexpected changes in regulatory environments;
