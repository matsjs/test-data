The nominal value of all collateral granted by these Group subsidiaries exceeds the combined book value of the loans for which they have been given.
Sanitec and certain of the Group subsidiaries have granted guarantees as collateral for certain pension liabilities. Those guarantees totaled 6.8 million (0.9 million) as of December 31, 2011.
Sanitec Group had off balance sheet actuarial pension liabilities 0.2 million in subsidiaries located in Finland.
Following the squeeze-out of the minority shareholders of Keramag Keramische Werke Aktiengesellschaft by Sofia Group in 2008, several minority shareholders are claiming an increase of the squeeze-out cash compensation. If they prevail, the cash compensation for all formerly outstanding shares will have to be increased. The increase will be determined by the court. At this stage, it cannot be assessed, whether there will be any amount payable to minority shareholders and, therefore, no provision has been recognized in the financial statements.
In addition Sanitec Group has 5.2 million (3.3 million) guarantees for other commitments.
