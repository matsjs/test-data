Assets classified as held-for-sale
Non-current assets and discontinued operations are classified as held-for-sale and stated at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, if their carrying value is recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. The sale should be considered highly probable.

A discontinued operation is a part of the entity that has been divested or classified as being held for sale and represents a separate core business area or geographic operation area.
Sanitec financial statements do not include any non-current assets held-for-sale or any discontinued operation.
Provisions
Provisions are recognized in the balance sheet, if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and that it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are related e.g. to the restructuring plans, environmental obligations, tax risks or legal proceedings. Provisions are based on the past experience and best estimates available at the balance sheet date.
