OUTLOOK FOR 2012
The macroeconomic uncertainties emerging during the third quarter continued during the last quarter. The problems experienced by the financial markets in Europe are creating considerable uncertainty in the market and it is difficult to estimate what the direct and indirect implications of this will be. The Net Sales is not expected to substantially improve coming financial period. The management of Sanitec Group has initiated actions to improve profitability, reduce costs and improve cash flow. Among other measures, the company is exiting poorly performing market segments, and continuously improving productivity in all processes including the reduction of overhead and personnel costs.
