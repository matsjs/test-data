No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
(7) Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such holders have made written request and offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory in the sole opinion of the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except (subject to the provisions described under "--Amendment, supplement and waiver") to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no holder of any of the Notes has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the Indenture or any remedy thereunder, unless the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have made a written request to, and offered indemnity and/or security satisfactory to, in the sole opinion of the Trustee, institute such proceeding as trustee under the Notes and the Indenture, the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding within 30 days after receipt of such notice and indemnity and/or security and the Trustee within such 30-day period has not received directions inconsistent with such written request by holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Such limitations do not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a holder of a Note for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note.

(8) If a Default or an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and is known to the Trustee, the Trustee will mail to each holder of the Notes notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 Business Days after its occurrence. Except in the case of a Default or an Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts or interest on any Notes, the Trustee may withhold the notice to the holders of such Notes if a committee of its trust officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the holders of the Notes.
(9) the Issuer is required to furnish to the Trustee annual statements regarding compliance with the Indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer is required to promptly deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default. The Trustee is under no obligation to monitor the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default and shall rely conclusively on instructions from the Issuer as to whether any Default or Event of Default has occurred.
LEGAL DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE OF THE INDENTURE
The Indenture will provide that the Issuer may, at the option of its Board of Directors as evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officer's Certificate, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes and Guarantees ("Legal Defeasance"). Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Debt represented by the outstanding Notes and Guarantees except as to:
(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;
(b) the Issuer's obligations to issue temporary Notes, register, transfer or exchange any Notes, replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, maintain an office or agency for payments in respect of the Notes and segregate and hold such payments in trust;
