The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind securing Debt upon any of their property or assets constituting Collateral, whether owned at or acquired after the Issue Date, other than Permitted Collateral Liens.
(a) in the case of any Lien securing Subordinated Debt, the Issuer's obligations in respect of the Notes (or the Guarantees in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Debt of the Guarantors) are directly secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to the Lien securing the Subordinated Debt until such time as the Subordinated Debt is no longer secured by a Lien; and
(b) in the case of any other Lien, the Issuer's obligations in respect of the Notes (or the Guarantees in the case of Liens securing Debt of the Guarantors), and all other amounts due under the Indenture are equally and ratably secured with the obligation or liability secured by such Lien until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged (i) upon the release and discharge of the initial Lien to which it relates under clause (a) or (b) of the second paragraph above and (ii) otherwise as set forth under "--Release of Liens."
Limitation on sale of certain assets
(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Sale unless:
(a) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Sale is not less than the Fair Market Value of the assets sold or Capital Stock issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and
(b) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset Sale consists of: (i) cash; (ii) Cash Equivalents; (iii) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion; (iv) the assumption by the purchaser of any liabilities, as recorded on the balance sheet of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or the Guarantees), that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and as a result of which the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with respect to such liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities; (v) Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of such Debt in connection with such Asset Sale; (vi) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (2)(e), (f) or (g) of this covenant; (vii) consideration consisting of Debt (or the cancellation of Debt) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary received by the Issuer or any Guarantor from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided such Debt is repaid in full, cancelled or subordinated to the Notes and the Guarantees; (viii) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale; provided that the aggregate Fair Market Value of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, taken together with the Fair Market Value at the time of receipt of all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received and designated as such pursuant to this clause (viii), is less than (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of 25.0 million and 3.8% of Total Assets; or (ix) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) to (viii).
