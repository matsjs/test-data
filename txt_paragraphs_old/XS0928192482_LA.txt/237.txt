The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the Notes as described under the captions "--Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control" and "--Certain covenants--Limitation on sale of certain assets." The Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise.
If a Change of Control occurs at any time, then the Issuer must make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to each holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to 100,000 or in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof) of such holder's Notes, at a purchase price (the "Change of Control Purchase Price") in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Purchase Date") (subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant regular record dates that are prior to the Change of Control Purchase Date to receive interest due on an interest payment date). Purchases made under a Change of Control Offer will also be subject to other procedures set forth in the Indenture.
Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes in accordance with the Indenture and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice to each holder of the Notes at such holder's registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under "--Selection and notice," stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Notes on the Change of Control Purchase Date, and the notice will state:
(a) that a Change of Control has occurred, and the date it occurred and offering to purchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice;
(b) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control (including, but not limited to, applicable information with respect to pro forma historical income, cash flow and capitalization after giving effect to the Change of Control);
(c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, or such later date as is necessary to comply with requirements under the Exchange Act and any applicable securities laws or regulations;
(d) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid;
(e) that any Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and
(f) any other procedures that a holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance.
