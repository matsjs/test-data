Employee benefits Employee benefits decreased by 33.0 million, or 12.9%, to 222.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 255.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease primarily resulted from less salaries and wages being paid in 2011 (181.9 million), as compared to 2010 (214.1 million), due to a reduction in total headcount from an average of 7,860 employees during 2010 and 7,570 employees as of December 31, 2010 to an average of 7,391 employees during 2011 and 7,096 employees as of December 31, 2011. Among other reasons, these reductions were due to factory closures, including Sellessur-Cher in France and Alsager in the United Kingdom.
Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses decreased by 4.2 million, or 12.4%, to 29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease primarily resulted from the disposal of assets, which resulted in lower depreciation, as well as a more moderate investment level in all of our assets, which reduced amortization.
Financial income and expenses Financial income and expenses increased by 14.6 million to 15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase is primarily attributable to gains from debt write-offs of 11.2 million in 2010 which were not repeated in 2011. Financial expenses increased by 3.7 million, or 27.0%, to 17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase primarily resulted from foreign exchange losses of 6.1 million in 2011, as compared to foreign exchange gains of 1.5 million in 2010, offset by lower interest expense.
Income taxes Income taxes increased by 2.8 million to 3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase primarily resulted from higher profit before taxes in 2011 and adjusted income taxes for prior periods, partially offset by an increase in deferred taxes.
Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA increased by 28.6 million, or 37.1%, to 105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 77.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The Adjusted EBITDA margin increased from 9.9% in 2010 to 13.7% in 2011. The primary drivers were a reduction in Materials and services and employee benefits as a percentage of net sales.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our liquidity requirements arise primarily from the need to meet our ongoing debt service obligations and fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents on-hand and borrowings under our financing agreements. See "Description o f other indebtedness." Based on our current expectations regarding our results of operations and cash flow and our ability to borrow in the financial and capital markets, we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet all of our current and planned liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.
If our working capital requirements exceed our projections or if our operating cash flow is lower than expected, we may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depends on numerous factors, including general macroeconomic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions and in the capital markets, restrictions in instruments governing our indebtedness and/or general financial performance. For a discussion of the risks related to our borrowings, see "Riskfactors-- Risks relating to the Notes and our capital structure."
