Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following events:
(a) the Issuer becomes aware of (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) any "person" or "group" of related persons (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), other than one or more Permitted Holders, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Issuer; provided that for the purposes of this clause, (x) no Change of Control shall be deemed to occur by reason of the Issuer becoming a Subsidiary of a Successor Parent and (y) any Voting Stock of which any Permitted Holder is the "beneficial owner" (as so defined) shall not be included in any Voting Stock of which any such person or group is the "beneficial owner" (as so defined), unless that person or group is not an affiliate of a Permitted Holder and has the sole voting power with respect to that Voting Stock; or

(b) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to a Person, other than or one or more Permitted Holders.
The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes if made prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control.
If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to a Change of Control Offer on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "all or substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person.
