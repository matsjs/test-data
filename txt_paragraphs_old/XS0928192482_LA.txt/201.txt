In addition to salary, members of our top management team are generally entitled to, with some exceptions, an annual bonus of maximum 50-60% of their annual salary in accordance with the Sanitec bonus scheme, annual pensions premiums equal to 15 27.5% of their annual salary, sickness benefits equal to 75-100% of their monthly salary for the first 3-6 months of any period of illness and a company car.
In the event their employment agreements are terminated by the Company, all top management employees (with some exceptions) are entitled to at least 12 months' severance pay. The majority of management is bound by non-compete and non-solicitation (with respect to customers and other employees) obligations during 12 months after the cessation of their employment. The non compete provisions do not contain any express provision for compensation during the non-compete period.
