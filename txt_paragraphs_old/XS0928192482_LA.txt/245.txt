(o) Contribution Debt;
(p) the incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt represented by guarantees of any Management Advances;
(q) take-or-pay obligations and customer deposits and advance payments received in the ordinary course of business from customers for goods purchased in the ordinary course of business; and

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Debt, the payment of dividends on Preferred Stock or Redeemable Capital Stock in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Redeemable Capital Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Debt due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Debt for purposes of this covenant.
(1) For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the incurrence of Debt in euros where Debt is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Debt will be the Euro Equivalent determined on the date of such determination; provided that if any such Debt denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to euros) covering principal amounts payable on such Debt, the amount of such Debt expressed in euros will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such Currency Agreement. The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Debt incurred in the same currency as the Debt being refinanced will be the Euro Equivalent of the Debt refinanced determined on the date such Debt being refinanced was initially incurred, except to the extent that such Euro Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Agreement (with respect to euros), in which case, the amount of such Permitted Refinancing Debt will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such Currency Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, for purposes of determining compliance with this "--Limitation on Debt" covenant, increases in Debt solely due to fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies or currency values will not be deemed to exceed the maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur under the "--Limitation on Debt" covenant.
(2) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under this "--Limitation on Debt" covenant:
(a) obligations with respect to letters of credit, guarantees or Liens, in each case supporting Debt otherwise included in the determination of such particular amount will not be included; and
