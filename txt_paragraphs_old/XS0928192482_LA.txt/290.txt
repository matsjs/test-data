(ii) cash and non-cash dividends due (whether or not declared) on the Redeemable Capital Stock of the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiaries and on the Preferred Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary (to any Person other than the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary), in each case for such period,
provided that in calculating the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or any element thereof for any period, pro forma calculations will be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer (including any anticipated expenses and cost savings and cost reduction synergies), including, without limitation, as a result of, or that would result from any actions taken by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary including, without limitation, in connection with any cost reduction or cost savings plan or program or in connection with any transaction, investment, acquisition, disposition, restructuring, corporate reorganization or otherwise, in the good faith judgment of the chief executive officer, chief financial officer or any person performing a similarly senior accounting role of the Issuer (regardless of whether these cost savings and cost reduction synergies could then be reflected in pro forma financial statements to the extent prepared)); providedfurther, without limiting the application of the previous proviso, that:
(a) if the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has incurred any Debt since the beginning of such period that remains outstanding or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is an incurrence of Debt or both, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Net Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after giving effect on a pro forma basis to such Debt as if such Debt had been incurred on the first day of such period and the discharge of any other Debt repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged with the proceeds of such new Debt as if such discharge had occurred on the first day of such period; provided however, that the pro forma calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall not give effect to (i) any Debt incurred on the date of determination pursuant to the provisions described in clause (2) under the caption "--Certain covenants--Limitation on Debt" or (ii) the discharge on the date of determination of any Debt to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds incurred pursuant to the provisions described in clause (2) under the caption "-- Certain covenants--Limitation on Debt;"
(b) if, since the beginning of such period, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall have made any Asset Sale, Consolidated EBITDA for such period shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if positive) directly attributable to the assets which are the subject of such Asset Sale for such period, or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if negative) directly attributable thereto, for such period and the Consolidated Net Interest Expense for such period shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated Net Interest Expense directly attributable to any Debt of the Issuer or of any Restricted Subsidiary repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged with respect to the Issuer and the continuing Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such Asset Sale for such period (or, if the Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary is sold, the Consolidated Net Interest Expense for such period directly attributable to the Debt of such Restricted Subsidiary to the extent the Issuer and the continuing Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer liable for such Debt after such sale);
