GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Net sales of the Group were 752.8 million during the financial year 2012 (770.8 million during the financial year 2011). The reduction in net sales of 2.3% was primarily caused by lower volumes in 2012 compared with prior year due to weaker market demand especially during the last quarter of 2012 and the disposal of Leda S.A.S in October 2012. Comparable net sales, using comparable exchange rates with 2011 and same structure, decreased by 3.0%.
Net sales of North Europe and East Europe increased mainly driven by increased demand in Norway and Finland, where as in other regions net sales decreased slightly on the back of weaker market demand.
Other operating income amounted to 5.4 million (9.4 million) and related mainly to transportation costs charged to customers, while the gains on sale of fixed assets were lower than in prior year.
The Group's EBITDA before non-recurring items amounted to 107.6 million (14.3% of net sales) compared with prior year's 105.7 million (13.7%). The EBITDA including non-recurring items of 102.7 million improved by 6.1% from prior year's 96.8 million. The improvement was due to the combined effect of sales of better product mix, increased efficiencies in supply chain (manufacturing and purchasing), effects of more focused activities in the sales and marketing area as well as cost reductions in support functions due to improved processes and procedures.
Operating profit in the financial period amounted to 73.0 million (67.1 million) or 9.7% (8.7%) of net sales.
Financial items, taxes and profit fo r the period
Financial income and expenses totaled -6.0 million (-15.9 million) for the period. The main reason for the improvement in total financial income and expenses derive from net gains from foreign exchange in 2012 amounting to 3.2 million, while in prior year the net impact from foreign exchange was negative at -6.1 million. Net interest expenses were -8.5 million (-7.1 million) during the financial period.
Income taxes totaled 4.7 million (-3.5 million).
