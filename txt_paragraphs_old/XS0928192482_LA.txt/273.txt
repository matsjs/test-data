(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;
(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors in connection therewith; and
(d) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.
In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants set forth in the Indenture ("Covenant Defeasance"), and thereafter any omission to comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events described under "--Events of Default" will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. These events do not include events relating to non-payment or, solely with respect to the Issuer, bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and reorganization. The Issuer may exercise its Legal Defeasance option regardless of whether they previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:
(a) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited in trust with the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in euros, non-callable European Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in each case in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of internationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to pay and discharge the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, on the outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must (x) specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such Stated Maturity or to a particular redemption date; and (y) if applicable, have delivered to the Trustee an irrevocable notice to redeem all the outstanding Notes of such principal, premium, if any, or interest;
(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee stating that (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
(d) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of the Notes over the other creditors of the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuer or others; and
