Amendment
Except for amendments of a minor, technical or administrative nature which may be effected by the Security Agent, or amendments that only affect one class of secured party and which could not be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect the interests of the other classes, which can be implemented by the consent of that affected class, the Intercreditor Agreement may be amended with the consent of only the required percentage of the RCF Lenders as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement, the required percentage of Noteholders (as set out in the Indenture), the required percentage of Pari Passu Creditors (as set out in the relevant Pari Passu Debt documentation), the Company and the Security Agent unless it relates to certain specified matters such as ranking, priority, subordination, turnover, enforcement, disposal proceeds, amendments or the payment waterfall. Such amendments require consent from all Super Senior Creditors, the required percentage of Noteholders (as set out in the Indenture), the required percentage of Pari Passu Creditors (as set out in the relevant Pari Passu Debt documentation), and each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent such amendments adversely affect it or relate to the nature or scope of Transaction Security), the Company and the Security Agent.
No amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement may impose new or additional obligations on or withdraw or reduce the rights of any party (other than in a way which affects creditors of that party's class generally) to the Intercreditor Agreement without the prior consent of that party.
The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended without the consent of the Noteholders in certain circumstances set out further in "Description o f the Notes--Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and additional Intercreditor Agreements" below.
To the extent the Debtors wish to enter into Pari Passu Debt or other additional or replacement indebtedness which is permitted to share in the Collateral pursuant to the Revolving Facility Agreement, Indenture and other Pari Passu Debt documentation, then the parties to the Intercreditor Agreement may be required to enter into a replacement intercreditor agreement as set out further in "Description o f the Notes--Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and additional Intercreditor Agreements" below on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement.
