The Issuer undertakes that it will maintain a paying agent in an EU Member State that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26-27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive.
No service charge will be made for any registration of a transfer, exchange or redemption of the Notes, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange (but not for a redemption).
ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS
All payments made by the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors with respect to any Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future tax, duty, levy, assessment or other governmental charge, including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax ("Taxes") unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is then incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision thereof or therein or (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including the jurisdiction of any paying agent for the Notes) or any political subdivision thereof or therein (each, a "Tax Jurisdiction") will at any time be required to be made from any payments made by the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors under or with respect to any Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the "Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder of Notes after such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:
(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence of any actual or deemed present or former connection between the holder or the beneficial owner of the Notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, the relevant holder, if the relevant holder is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including being a resident of such jurisdiction for Tax purposes), other than the holding of such Note, the enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Guarantee or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note or a Guarantee;
(b) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment where presentation is required more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);
(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;
(d) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to an individual that are required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive;
