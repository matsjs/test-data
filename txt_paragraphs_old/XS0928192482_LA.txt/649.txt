The Group has recognized deferred tax assets for its tax loss carry forwards and has established a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets. The determination was based upon what is probable in each tax jurisdiction.
As of December 31, 2011, retained earnings in foreign subsidiaries consisted mainly of those within European Union countries, Switzerland and Norway. As Sanitec Corporation is able to repatriate such retained earnings tax free, no deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries is recognized.
