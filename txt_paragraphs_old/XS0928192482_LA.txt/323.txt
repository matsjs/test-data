EUROPEAN UNION SAVINGS DIRECTIVE Under the European Union Directive on the taxation of savings income (Council Directive 2003/48/EC, the "EU Savings Directive"), each European Union member state ("Member State") is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident in that other Member State; however, for a transitional period, Austria and Luxembourg may instead apply a withholding system in relation to such payments, deducting tax at a rate of 35%. The transitional period is to terminate at the end of the first full fiscal year following agreement by certain non-European Union countries to the exchange of information relating to such payments. A number of non-European Union countries, and certain dependent or associated territories of certain Member States, have agreed to adopt similar measures (either provision of information of transitional withholding) in relation to payments made by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident in a Member State. In addition, the Member States have entered into reciprocal provision of information arrangements or transitional withholding arrangements with certain of those dependent or associated territories in relation to payments made by a person in a Member State to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident in one of those territories. The European Commission has published proposals for amendments to the EU Savings Directive, which, if implemented, would amend and broaden the scope of the requirements above.

Certain ERISA considerations
The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") imposes fiduciary standards and certain other requirements on "employee benefit plans" (as defined in ERISA) subject to Title I of ERISA, including, but not limited to, entities such as bank collective investment funds and insurance company separate accounts and other entities or accounts whose underlying assets include "plan assets" as defined in U.S. Department of Labor Regulation Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (collectively, "ERISA Plans") and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA's general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan's investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the plan. Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") also imposes certain requirements on plans described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, including, but not limited to, plans not subject to Title I of ERISA such as individual retirement accounts (such plans together with ERISA Plans, "Plans").
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a Plan and certain persons having certain relationships to Plans (referred to as "parties in interest" or "disqualified persons"), unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other things, whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between a Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of any Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer, the underwriters, the Guarantors, any lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the agents or any of their respective affiliates. Depending on the satisfaction of certain conditions which may include the identity of the Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire or hold the Notes on behalf of a Plan, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA or Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption ("PTCE") 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by a "qualified professional asset manager"), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager) (collectively, the "Class Exemptions") could provide an exemption from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. However, there can be no assurance that any of these Class Exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code.
Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA.
Non-U.S. plans, governmental plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-US, state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code ("Similar Laws"). Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such law or regulations.
By its acceptance of any Note, each original and subsequent purchaser and transferee of any Note will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either: (a) no portion of the assets used to acquire or hold the Notes constitutes assets of any Plan or non-U.S., governmental or church plan subject to any Similar Laws or entity whose underlying assets are considered to include "plan assets" of any such Plan, account or arrangement or (b) the purchase and holding of the Notes will not constitute a non exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Laws. The sale of any Notes to a Plan or plan subject to Similar Laws is in no respect a representation by the Issuer or any of its affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any such plan generally or any particular Plan or plan subject to Similar Laws, or that such investment is appropriate for such plans generally or any particular Plan or plan subject to Similar Laws.
