We divide our key customers into three categories: international key customers with a presence in multiple countries; national buying groups that constitute more than 1.0 million in sales per year; and other customers, who do not fall into the preceding two categories. All our customer agreements are entered into on a local level; therefore, customers having businesses in several countries normally have business relationships with multiple business units.
Below is a chart depicting the breakdown of our net sales by customer category:
In addition, we also export products to countries outside the regions where we have subsidiaries or sales offices. Such sales are made through country- or region- specific distributors or agents.

MARKETING AND SALES Although we have centralized many marketing and sales-related activities, we sell our bathroom products under our strong national brand names through our national sales forces, who provide in-depth market knowledge and management expertise and cover clients directly in their allocated region. In most of our core markets, our sales organization is structured with a country manager responsible for the local sales organization and for implementing strategic initiatives provided by our global sales and marketing leadership. Sales budgets are set by group management and local sales teams through a top-down (group to regional to national) approach and are implemented on a local level with a commission-based sales structure.
