FX derivatives not designated in a hedge relationship are carried at fair value through profit or loss.
The foreign exchange risk sensitivity analysis according to IFRS 7 for the most important currency pairs has been calculated for the Group's foreign currency nominated financial assets and liabilities, including foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at the reporting date. The foreign exchange risk sensitivity analysis represents the impact of a change in the foreign exchange rates of 10 percent to the statement of income and to the equity on the balance sheet date. Changes in the equity are caused by foreign exchange forwards designated in cash flow hedge accounting. The effects of 10% appreciation in the most significant currency pairs on profit or loss and equity are presented in the tables below. The sensitivity analysis is based on the assumption that two month of the 12 months forecasted foreign exchange exposure it recognized in balance sheet.
