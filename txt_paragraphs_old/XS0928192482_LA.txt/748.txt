The fair value hierarchy of the financial instruments:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)
Financial derivatives are valued in line with Level 2.
