Net sales in ceramics sanitaryware decreased slightly, primarily due to lower volumes, which were partially offset by the improved product and country mix. Net sales in ceramics complementary products increased primarily due to higher sales of bathroom furniture and pre-wall products, which was offset by our sale of Domino.
Other operating income
Other operating income decreased by 3.5 million, or 27.1%, to 9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease primarily resulted from higher sales of fixed assets in the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to the sale of Domino.
Materials and services
Materials and services decreased by 16.8 million, or 4.6%, to 349.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 366.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease primarily resulted from improved efficiency in our production processes and production facilities due to increases in yields (improved re-fire rates) and positive effects from purchasing initiatives (e.g., improved terms and conditions with suppliers).

Employee benefits Employee benefits decreased by 33.0 million, or 12.9%, to 222.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 255.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease primarily resulted from less salaries and wages being paid in 2011 (181.9 million), as compared to 2010 (214.1 million), due to a reduction in total headcount from an average of 7,860 employees during 2010 and 7,570 employees as of December 31, 2010 to an average of 7,391 employees during 2011 and 7,096 employees as of December 31, 2011. Among other reasons, these reductions were due to factory closures, including Sellessur-Cher in France and Alsager in the United Kingdom.
Other operating expenses Other operating expenses decreased by 72.5 million, or 39.2%, to 112.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 184.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease primarily resulted from other operating expenses incurred in 2010, including the 57.7 million fine imposed by the European Commission in relation to alleged price fixing, see "Riskfactors--Risks related to our business and industry-- We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, including environmental laws, health and safety regulations and antitrust laws" and "Business--Legal proceedings," and significant restructuring expenses. In 2011, we recognized one time costs of 6.4 million related to factory closures in France (initiated in 2010) and in the United Kingdom (completed in 2011) and other restructuring costs of 2.5 million, which included redundancy costs related to previous members of our management team, and other restructuring activities, as well as legal and other consulting fees charged with respect to the European Commission fine.
