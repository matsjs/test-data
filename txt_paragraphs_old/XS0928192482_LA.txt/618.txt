Long-term debt is initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Debt is classified as current liability unless Sanitec has an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs
The borrowing costs related to property, plant and equipment or other intangible assets that require substantial period of construction are capitalized for the period needed to produce the investment for the intended purpose. Other borrowing costs are recognized in the profit or loss statement for the period, in which they incurred.
Goodwill and intangible assets
The goodwill arising on a business combination results from the excess of acquisition cost over net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and tested annually for impairment.
Other intangible assets consist of patents and copyrights, licenses, and software. These are measured at historical costs and amortized using the straight-line method over their useful lives. Other separately identifiable intangible assets are recognized in the balance sheet only, if it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. The amortization period of intangible assets is 3-10 years.
Research and development costs are normally expensed as other operating expenses for the financial year they incur. If the criteria for commercial and technical feasibility in accordance with IAS 38 have been met, development costs are capitalized and amortized during the expected economic life of the underlying technology.
