Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the holders or any action on the part of the Trustee.
LIMITATIONS UNDER GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS
The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee and the Security Interests it has granted to secure the Notes will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor without resulting in its obligations under its Guarantee and Security Interests, as applicable, being voidable or unenforceable under applicable laws relating to fraudulent transfer or under similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or the maximum amount otherwise permitted by law. In particular, each Guarantee and its Security Interests will be limited as required to comply with corporate benefit, maintenance of capital and other laws applicable in the jurisdiction of the relevant Guarantor. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's obligations under its Guarantee or its Security Interests could be significantly less than amounts payable in respect of the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligations under its Guarantee or its Security Interests. See "Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Deeds of Surety."
