The decrease in sales shown in the above table was due primarily to lower volumes driven by weakening markets and increased competition in certain markets in North Europe and South Europe. In South Europe, our decline in net sales was due to decreased public spending and the reduced availability of credit for our customers as well as our divestment of Domino. The decrease in net sales in North Europe was primarily due to weak market conditions in Denmark, increased competition in the shower products market in Norway and distribution challenges in the Swedish market. The decrease in net sales in the United Kingdom and Ireland was due partially to currency translation effects and partially to weak economic conditions in the United Kingdom overall, as well as cutbacks in government spending which led to a slowdown in the construction industry. These effects were partially offset by strong sales growth in Central Europe (primarily Germany) due to the successful introduction of new products in that market. Relatively flat net sales in East Europe were primarily due to the termination on October 6, 2010 of our former joint venture in Russia, NSF, which had annual sales at the time of our joint venture's termination of approximately 3.5 million.
