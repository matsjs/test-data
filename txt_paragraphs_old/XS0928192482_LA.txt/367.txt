> where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds;
> there is some possibility that an Italian Court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian Court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so;
> enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of right;
> the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;
> any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

> it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether under Italian law a security can be created and perfected (i) in favor of creditors which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a trustee in respect of notes on behalf of the noteholders, since there is no established concept of ``trust'' or ``trustee'' under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a trustee as agent or trustee for holders of the notes under security interests on Italian assets is debatable under Italian law;
