(6) If the Issuer is required to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with such securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations described in this covenant by virtue thereof.
The Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable for the payment of (i) any Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor under any Credit Facilities incurred pursuant to clause (2)(b) of the covenant "--Limitation on Debt" or (ii) any Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor (other than the Notes), unless:
(a) such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee of payment of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms as the guarantee of such Debt; and
(b) with respect to any guarantee of Subordinated Debt by such Restricted Subsidiary, any such guarantee shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary's Guarantee with respect to the Notes at least to the same extent as such Subordinated Debt is subordinated to the Notes.
The immediately preceding paragraph will not be applicable to any guarantees of any Restricted Subsidiary:
(i) existing on the date of the Indenture;
(ii) arising solely due to the granting of a Permitted Lien; or
(iii) given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less than 500 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee was given, of at least A or the equivalent thereof by S&P and at least A2 or the equivalent thereof by Moody's, in connection with the operation of cash management programs established for the Issuer's benefit or that of any Restricted Subsidiary.
