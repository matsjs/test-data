> Statutory priorities. The statutory priority given to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different than priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other European Union jurisdictions. In Italy, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, which include the claims of the Italian Tax Authority and social security administrators and claims for employee wages. The rules of statutory priority apply irrespective of whether the proceeds are derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt's estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes the order of allocation of proceeds deriving from liquidation shall.
According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to:
> bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization and other laws of general application relating to or affecting the rights of creditors as such law may be applied in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy with respect to the relevant party;
> an Italian Court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court;
> in contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code;
> claims arising under documents governed by Italian law may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni and decadenze) or may be or become subject to a defence of set off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;
> pursuant to Articles 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets and are equally liquid and payable;
> where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds;
> the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the fact that the relevant provisions of laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles;
