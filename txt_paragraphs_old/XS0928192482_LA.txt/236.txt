The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in "--Selection and notice"), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a "Tax Redemption Date") and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts (but, in the case of the relevant Guarantor, only if such amount cannot be paid by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and the Issuer or Guarantor, as applicable, cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it (including making payment through a paying agent located in another jurisdiction), and the requirement arises as a result of:
82
(b) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or application of such laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which amendment or change has not been publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date) (each of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), a "Change in Tax Law").
The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or Guarantor, as applicable, would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes was then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that there has been such amendment or change which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it.
Absent manifest error, the Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of Notes.
The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.
SINKING FUND; OFFERS TO PURCHASE; OPEN MARKET PURCHASES
The Issuer is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the Notes as described under the captions "--Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control" and "--Certain covenants--Limitation on sale of certain assets." The Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise.
