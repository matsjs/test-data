Research and development costs are normally expensed as other operating expenses for the financial year they incur. If the criteria for commercial and technical feasibility in accordance with IAS 38 have been met, development costs are capitalized and amortized during the expected economic life of the underlying technology.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Cost may also include transfers from equity of any gain/losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment. Land and water areas are not depreciated.
Depreciation on plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets according to plan as follows:
Buildings.................................................................................................................................... Heavy production machinery and equipment........................................................................ Light production machinery and equipment......................................................................... Other machinery and equipment............................................................................................. Land............................................................................................................................................
20--40 years 10--20 years
8--10 years 3--5 years
No depreciation
F-15
Residual values and expected useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date and if they differ significantly from previous estimates are adjusted to reflect changes in the expected future economic benefits.
