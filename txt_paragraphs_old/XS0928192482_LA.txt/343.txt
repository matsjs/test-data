> any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) or satisfaction of a debt to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing; (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time; or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental effect);
> any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security (including a guarantee) for a third party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings;
> any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to prejudice the insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act;
> any act that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan made to the debtor or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security (including a guarantee), the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; and

> any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Burge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).
In this context, "knowledge" is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., a Guarantor) was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor's intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor's imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor's creditors. With respect to a "related party," there is a general statutory presumption that such party had "knowledge." The term "related party" includes, subject to certain limitations, in the case of debtors that are corporate persons, members of the management or supervisory board, shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor's share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons.
Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security (including a guarantee) pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance differ to a certain extent from the above described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.
