If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes attain an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating Agencies and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (a "Suspension Event"), beginning on the day of the Suspension Event and continuing until such time (the "Suspension Period"), if any, at which the such Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Rating from each Rating Agency (the "Reversion Date"), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions, and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture, will not apply to the Notes:
(2) "--Certain covenants--Limitation on Restricted Payments;"
(3) "--Certain covenants--Limitation on transactions with Affiliates;" (4) "--Certain covenants--Limitation on sale of certain assets;"
(5) "--Certain covenants--Limitation on Guarantees of Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries;"
(6) "--Certain covenants--Limitation on dividend and other payment restrictions affecting Restricted Subsidiaries;"
(7) "--Certain covenants--Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries;" and (8) "--Certain covenants--Consolidation, merger and sale of assets" (but only clause (c) of the first paragraph of such
covenant).

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms on and after the Reversion Date. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the Suspension Period, and the "--Certain covenants--Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant will be interpreted as if it had been in effect since the Issue Date except that no default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made during the Suspension Period. On the Reversion Date, all Debt incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Period will be classified as having been incurred pursuant to clause (2)(d) of the covenant described under "--Certain covenants--Limitation on Debt." Any transactions prohibited by the covenant described under "--Certain covenants--Limitation on transactions with Affiliates" entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (iv) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "--Certain covenants--Limitation on transactions with Affiliates." Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (a) through (d) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under "--Certain covenants--Limitation on dividend and other payment restrictions affecting Restricted Subsidiaries" that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (a) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "--Certain covenants--Limitation on dividend and other payment restrictions affecting Restricted Subsidiaries." No Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant described under "--Certain covenants-- Limitation on Guarantees of Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries" after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period. Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Period, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
