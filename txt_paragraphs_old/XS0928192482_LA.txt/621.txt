Leasing agreements
Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and rewards, are classified as operating leases. Rental payments under operating leases are recognized as expenses when incurred.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or average cost method for finished goods and the average cost method for raw materials. Cost includes direct manufacturing, labor and materials, variable overhead and allocable portion of production and project administration overheads. Costs associated with assets produced for internal use are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
Trade receivable
Trade receivables are recognized at invoice value, less a provision for doubtful accounts. Management considers current information and events regarding the debtors' ability to repay their obligations, and makes a provision against amounts due when it is probable that the full amount will not be collected. Changes in the level of provision are recorded as bad debt expense.
Pensions
The Group has several different pension plans in accordance with local conditions and practices where it operates. The plans are generally funded through payments to insurance companies.
Pension plans are classified as defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. Payments to defined contribution plans are reported in the income statement as part of personnel expenses in the period, in which employees perform the services providing the entitlement to the respective contributions. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further compensations, if the pension fund has not adequate assets to pay the employees the benefits in question. All the pension plans that do not meet the above criteria are classified as defined benefit plans.
