The Revolving Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with it will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English law, although the restrictive covenants, which are included in the Revolving Facility Agreement and largely replicate those contained in the Indenture, will be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that all the other provisions of the Revolving Facility Agreement are governed by English law).
In connection with entering into the Revolving Facility Agreement and the Indenture, the Issuer, the Borrowers and the Guarantors, among others, will enter into an intercreditor agreement (the ``Intercreditor Agreement'') to govern the relationships and relative priorities among: (i) the creditors of the Revolving Credit Facility (the ``RCF Lenders''); (ii) the Trustee on behalf of itself and the holders of the Notes (the "Noteholders") (iii) future hedge counterparties under certain hedging agreements (the ``Hedge Counterparties''); (iv) certain future creditors of the Restricted Group; (v) certain intra-group creditors, structural creditors and debtors; (vi) various creditor representatives; and (vii) Wilmington Trust (London) Limited as Security Agent.
The Company and each of its subsidiaries that incurs any liability or provides any guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility or the Indenture or the Pari Passu Debt documentation (as defined below) is referred to in this description as ``Debtors''.
The Intercreditor Agreement will set out, among other things:
> the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;
> the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors;
> when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;
> when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;
> the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events;
