Following the completion of this Offering, our primary sources of liquidity will remain cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility in addition to cash on our balance sheet. Our ability to meet future working capital, capital expenditure and restructuring and debt service requirements will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control.
We generally require capital expenditures to maintain and improve our infrastructure, implement productivity and value creation programs, new product development, enhance manufacturing facilities, improve health and safety equipments, create moulds and tools, implement flexible manufacturing capabilities and develop capitalized software. Investments, including both investments in intangible and tangible assets as well as investments in non-controlling interests were 13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, 36.4 million (of which investments in non-controlling interests were 13.1 million) for the year ended December 31, 2011, and 36.4 million in 2010. We estimate that our total capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2013 will be approximately 20.0 million.
