The Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions relating to future indebtedness that may be incurred by the Debtors, provided that it is permitted by the terms of the Revolving Facility Agreement and the Indenture, which may rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes and be secured by the Collateral (``Pari Passu Debt'') subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Creditors of the Pari Passu Debt (the "Pari Passu Creditors") will have the rights under the Intercreditor Agreement, which are summarized below.

The Intercreditor Agreement also allows, (a) the incurrence of additional credit facilities up to an agreed limit and (b) after the Credit Facilities Liabilities (as defined below) have been fully and finally discharged, for the Debtors to enter into a new super senior credit facility, provided that the total amount outstanding under such facility is permitted under the Indenture. For the purposes of this description, any references to the Revolving Credit Facility or the RCF Lenders or Credit Facilities Liabilities (as defined below) should be read as including any such additional credit facilities and/or new super senior credit facility.
By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.
The following description is a summary of certain provisions that will be contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety nor does it describe provisions relating to the rights and obligations of holders of other classes of our debt. As such, we urge you to read the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the description that follows, defines the rights of the holders of the Notes.
