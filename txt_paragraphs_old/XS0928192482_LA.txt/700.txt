Average interest rate for borrowings have been 5.02 % (2010 4.02 %, 2009 3.68 %).
Even though the related party loans themselves do not contain covenants, the related party loans are tied contractually to the senior credit facility loan terms, which loan is held by the holding company Sofia III S.a r.l. The senior loans contain covenants including maximum leverage, minimum interest fixed charge coverage ratios, liquidity and restrictions on capital expenditure. These covenants and certain other terms limit the actions of Sanitec Group as well. Sofia III S.a r.l. is compliant with covenant requirements as at December 31, 2011.
Almost all other loans were related to PJSC Slavutskiy Plant Budfarfor, which is Ukrainian subsidiary of Sanitec Corporation. As at December 31, 2011 allegedly some financial covenants of the 25.8 million loan were not met. The bank did not take any measures as a result of such alleged breaches and a new loan agreement with new covenant restrictions has been subsequently agreed. At February 29, 2012 PJSC Slavuta Plant Budfarfor made a new loan agreement with the lenders.
According to the new loan agreement the loans are maturing in year 2012-2018. At December 31, 2011 the loan is reported as short-term.
