The Group tax losses of December 31, 2012 include 104.5 million losses that belong to B.V. "De Sphinx" . Due to the changes in the group structure in 2009/2010 the losses of B.V. "De Sphinx" may require an exemption from the Dutch tax authorities.
The Group has recognized deferred tax assets for its tax loss carry forwards to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. The determination was based upon what is probable in each tax jurisdiction.
