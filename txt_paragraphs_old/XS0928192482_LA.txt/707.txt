15. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Liquidity risk
Sanitec aims to maintain an optimal amount of liquidity to fund the business operations of the Group at all times while minimizing interest costs. Liquidity is considered to be the sum of cash and cash equivalents and available committed credit facilities. As of the end of the year 2011, the aggregate of unutilized committed revolving credit facility is EUR 50.0 million (50.0 million) and cash and cash equivalents amounted to 161.3 million (138.5 million).

Credit risk
Group Treasury evaluates and monitors financial counterparty risk. The Group minimizes this risk by limiting its counterparties to a limited number of major banks and financial institutions, by monitoring their performance, and by working within agreed counterparty limits.
Non-financial counterparty risk, i.e. counterparty risk related to customers, is reduced by Group companies, by applying a credit policy, constant monitoring of receivables aging and by credit insurance. Further analysis on aging of trade receivables is presented under note 11 other current receivables.
Currency risk
Foreign exchange risk is regarded as uncertainty of cash flows and earnings that arises from fluctuations in currency rates. The Group looks at the foreign exchange risks from three angles: transaction risk related to cash flows in other than functional currencies, translation risk related foreign exchange risk associated with consolidation of the Group, and the economic risk related to changes in competitive environment as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates.
