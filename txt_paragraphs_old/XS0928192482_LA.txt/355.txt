The insolvency proceedings may be carried out in two ways: (i) proceedings with the possibility of an arrangement (an arrangement may also provide for the satisfaction of creditors through liquidation of the bankrupt's assets) ("Arrangement Proceedings"); or (ii) proceedings involving the liquidation of the debtor's assets ("Liquidation Proceedings"). The Arrangement Proceedings are conducted with respect to the debtor, where it has been credibly established that the creditors' claims will be satisfied to a larger extent than they would be in Liquidation Proceedings. In the Arrangement Proceedings, certain claims are not subject to a potential arrangement (in particular, without limitation, claims secured on the bankrupt entity's assets by mortgage, pledge, registered pledge or transfer of title to movables, receivables or other rights are not subject to arrangement, however only to the extent covered by the value of assets on which security was established). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a creditor whose claims are so secured may consent to being subject to an arrangement. The court may change the manner of conducting the insolvency proceedings from the Arrangement Proceedings into the Liquidation Proceedings and vice versa, if the grounds for conducting a given type of the proceedings have became known after the declaration of bankruptcy.
Following a declaration of bankruptcy, any debt (claim) payable in a currency other than zloty and included in the list of claims, regardless of whether it has become due or not, must be converted into zloty at the National Bank of Poland's average exchange rate prevailing on the date of the declaration of bankruptcy. Accordingly, in the event of bankruptcy of a Guarantor, its creditors, including holders of Notes, may be subject to an exchange rate risk between the date of the declaration of bankruptcy and the date of receipt of any amounts in the course of insolvency proceedings.
Following the declaration of bankruptcy, any debt of a debtor, including a debt of a Guarantor in respect of the Notes, may be paid only after certain debts that are entitled to priority have been satisfied. Such preferential debts include, among other things, money owed to the State Treasury of Poland in respect of taxes or social security contributions or unpaid remuneration owed to employees.
It is not clear whether Polish courts and/or a bankruptcy estate administrator (zarzqdca) and/or a court receiver (nadzorca sqdowy) and/or a bankruptcy trustee (syndyk) (unless otherwise specifically stated, hereinafter the term "bankruptcy estate administrator" shall include each of zarzqdca, nadzorca sqdowy and/or syndyk) will give effect to intercreditor agreements and/or subordination agreements. There is a risk that, in the course of insolvency proceedings, claims of all unsecured creditors will be discharged on a pari passu basis, irrespectively of any intercreditor agreements and/or subordination agreements, and the creditors who are parties to such agreements may have to enforce their rights thereunder outside of the insolvency proceedings (e.g. by claiming the return of particular amounts from other creditors who are parties to such intercreditor agreements and/or subordination agreements).
Following a declaration of bankruptcy in respect of a Guarantor, the following would be recognized, by operation of law, as ineffective against the Guarantor's bankruptcy estate:
> any transaction of the Guarantor, including its guarantee, if such transaction was executed within one year prior to filing of the motion to declare the Guarantor bankrupt and to the extent that such transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, i.e., the Guarantor disposed of or encumbered its assets for no consideration or for a consideration where the value of the Guarantor's performance was glaringly higher than the consideration received by the Guarantor or reserved for a third party; the above restriction does not apply to security interests created before the date of the declaration of bankruptcy in connection with certain financial term contracts (terminowe operacjefinansowe) borrowing of financial instruments (pozyczka instrumentow fmansowych) or repo contracts in financial instruments (sprzedaz instrumentow finansowych ze zobowiqzaniem do ich odkupu), provided such contracts satisfy certain conditions set out in the Bankruptcy Law;
> security interests established by the Guarantor or the payment by the Guarantor of a debt not yet due if the security was established or the payment was made within two months prior to the filing of the motion to declare the Guarantor bankrupt; however, the holder of the respective security or a recipient of payment may file a lawsuit or plea seeking the assertion of effectiveness of the respective security or the payment, if at the time of execution of the transaction that holder or recipient was not aware of the existing grounds for declaring the Guarantor's bankruptcy; the above restriction does not apply to security interests created before the date of the declaration of bankruptcy in connection with certain financial term contracts (terminowe operacjefinansowe), borrowing of financial instruments (pozyczka instrumentow finansowych) or repo contracts financial instruments (sprzedaz instrumentow finansowych ze zobowiqzaniem do ich odkupu), provided such contracts satisfy certain conditions set out in the Bankruptcy Law; and
> any transactions if entered into within six months prior to the filing of the motion to declare the Guarantor bankrupt and to the extent they were entered into with entities related to the Guarantor: (i) the Guarantor's shareholders, their representatives and/or relatives; or (ii) affiliated companies, their shareholders, and/or representatives or relatives of such shareholders; and/or (iii) the Guarantor's subsidiary or holding companies.
