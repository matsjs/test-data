In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, will also pay and indemnify the holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Guarantee or any other document referred to therein (other than a transfer of Notes other than the initial resale by the initial purchasers), or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, (limited, solely in the case of taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (a) through (e), (g) or (h) above or any combination thereof), or any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Notes or any Guarantee.
The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee (or to a holder or beneficial owner upon written request), within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. If reasonably requested by the Trustee, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will provide to the Trustee such information as may be in the possession of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor (and not otherwise in the possession of the Trustee) to enable the Trustee to determine the amount of withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder; provided, however, that in no event shall the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor be required to disclose any information that it reasonably deems to be confidential.
Whenever in the Indenture or in this "Description of the Notes" there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment on the Notes (or any Guarantee) and any political subdivision thereof or therein.

CURRENCY INDEMNITY
The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable under the Notes and the Guarantees and the Indenture is euro. Any amount received or recovered in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees in a currency other than euro (whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the Trustee or a holder of the Notes in respect of any sum expressed to be due to such holder from the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will constitute a discharge of their obligation only to the extent of the euro amount, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in such other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If the euro amount to be recovered is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any Note, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any further purchase of euro, in an amount equal to such difference. These indemnities, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall cover any losses resulting from currency exchange and to the extent permitted by law:
(a) constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer's and the Guarantors' other obligations;
(b) give rise to a separate and independent cause of action;
