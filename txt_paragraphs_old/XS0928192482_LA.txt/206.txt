The Revolving Credit Facility will require that, for each annual period beginning January 1, 2014 (determined upon the receipt of annual financial statements), the Issuer and the guarantors of the Revolving Credit Facility generate at least 80.0% of the Issuer's consolidated EBITDA and 80.0% of the Issuer's total assets (determined based on such annual financial statements).
The Revolving Facility Agreement contains customary information and negative covenants (including restrictive covenants that largely replicate those contained in the Indenture), subject to certain agreed exceptions. The Revolving Facility Agreement also requires the Issuer, each Borrower and each guarantor under the Revolving Facility Agreement to observe certain customary affirmative covenants. In this respect, our financial and operating performance will be monitored by a financial covenant (requiring us to ensure that our Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio in respect of any Relevant Period shall not exceed 5:1).
Note purchase condition
The Revolving Credit Facility requires that if more than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes on the date of issue is repurchased, the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid and cancelled in the same proportion as that by which the Notes are reduced by such repurchase.
Events of default
The Revolving Facility Agreement contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to agreed grace periods, thresholds and other qualifications) the occurrence of which would allow the lenders to accelerate all or part of the outstanding utilizations and/or terminate their commitments and/or declare all or part of their utilizations payable on demand and/or declare that cash cover in respect of letters of credit and ancillary facilities is immediately due and payable.
Governing law
The Revolving Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with it will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English law, although the restrictive covenants, which are included in the Revolving Facility Agreement and largely replicate those contained in the Indenture, will be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that all the other provisions of the Revolving Facility Agreement are governed by English law).
