Revenue recognition
Revenues from the rendering of maintenance services and repairs are recognized when the services have been rendered or the work has been carried out.
Operating profit
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements does not give a definition for operating profit. The Group has defined operating profit as follows: operating profit is the revenue added with other operating income less materials and services, employee benefits, production for own use, other operating expenses, and depreciation, amortization and impairment losses.
Operating profit includes those exchange rate gains and losses that are related to the operative activities of the Group. Financing related exchange rate gains and losses are reported under financial income and expenses.

Government grants
Grants from the government are recognized at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with the related conditions. Government grants are related mainly to the investments in property, plant and equipment. These grants are deferred in the balance sheet and recognized in the income statement concurrently with the expenses they compensate.
