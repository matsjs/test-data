The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured on the Issue Date, subject to the terms of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, and the restrictions and limitations detailed herein, by first ranking security interests in (i) the share capital of the Issuer, certain of the Guarantors, Allia International S.A. and Slavuta Holdings LLC, (ii) a floating charge over certain assets of the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors, (iii) pledges over the bank accounts of the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors, (iv) pledges of certain trademark rights, (v) certain mortgages over the real property of certain Guarantors, and (vi) certain trade receivables of certain Guarantors as described under "Description o f the Notes-- Security
The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties under certain hedging obligations benefit from shared first ranking security over the same assets noted above.
The Security will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See "Description o f other indebtedness-- Intercreditor Agreement."
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liens securing the Notes will be first priority liens that rank equally with the liens that secure (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) certain other future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and (iii) certain priority hedging obligations. Such liens will be evidenced by security documents for the benefit of (whether directly or through a security trustee) the holders of the Notes, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to certain priority hedging obligations and the holders of certain other future indebtedness and obligations.
Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, however, in the event of enforcement of the security, holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the security only after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility have been repaid and obligations owed to counterparties to certain priority hedging obligations have been discharged.
Please see "Description o f other indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement."
In certain circumstances, we may secure specified indebtedness permitted to be incurred by the covenant described in "Description o f the Notes--Certain covenants--Limitation on Debt" by granting liens upon any or all of the Collateral, on an equal basis with the liens securing the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility and the obligations under certain priority hedging obligations.
