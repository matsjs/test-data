We are the leading European producer of ceramics sanitaryware and bathroom fixtures. We have a number one or two position in ceramics sanitaryware in each of our core Western European markets, which comprise Germany, the Benelux countries, the Nordic countries, France, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom, as well as strong positions in our growth markets, including Ukraine and Russia. In terms of ceramics complementary products, we have top five positions in the bath and shower segments and top ten positions in the pre-wall (eighth) and furniture (sixth) segments. There are also several regional markets where we have leading positions (for example, pre-wall in North Europe). Whilst the European market for ceramics sanitaryware is relatively consolidated, several CCP categories are more fragmented and characterized by specialist players active mostly in one product category and/or region, with a limited number of larger global players having broader product ranges. Our main competitors in the ceramics sanitaryware and ceramics complementary products segments in 2011 are set out below, together with their respective market position by volume.
