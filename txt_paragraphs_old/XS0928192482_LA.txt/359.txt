Consents and Notification
The enforcement of a registered pledge through the appropriation of the shares by the Security Agent may be recognized as a notifiable merger under the Competition Law. Therefore, the holder of the relevant Security Interest may be required to notify the Polish Office for Protection of Competition and Consumers about its intention to take over the shares. Further, it may be required to obtain an antimonopoly clearance to take over the shares.
UKRAINE
The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Ukraine.
Suretyships
Ukrainian entities will produce a Deed of Surety in lieu of a guarantee.
A deed of surety will constitute a suretyship for the purposes of Ukrainian law. According to the Law of Ukraine "On Financial Services and the State Regulation of the Markets of Financial Services" dated July 12, 2001, suretyships are considered "financial services", which may only be rendered by a duly licensed bank or other financial institution or, as an exception, by a non-financial

institution when expressly permitted by a law of Ukraine or the State Commission of Ukraine on the Regulation of the Markets of Financial Services (the "Commission"). The Commission has permitted non-financial institutions to issue suretyships, subject to compliance by the issuer of a suretyship with anti-money laundering requirements and procedures. Ukrainian companies often enter into suretyship agreements, and neither the Commission nor Ukrainian courts have as yet challenged such practice. However, due to a lack of guidance by the Commission with regard to the exact scope of such compliance, a particular surety could be viewed by the Ukrainian authorities or courts as not complying with such requirements and procedures and, accordingly, the legal capacity of such surety to issue a suretyship and the validity of any particular suretyship could be challenged.
