Cash _flow _from operating activities
Cash flow from investing activities
Our cash flow from investing activities gave rise to an outflow of 25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 versus an outflow of 28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This change primarily resulted from a greater inflow due to the disposal of assets, reduced capital investments in machinery and other fixed assets, offset by our acquisition of the remaining shares of Slavuta Holdings LLC.
Cash flow from financing activities
Our cash flow from financing activities gave rise to an outflow of 6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 versus an inflow of 3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This change primarily resulted from a 5.0 million distribution to our parent company in 2011 in order to provide for the operating expenses of that entity, in comparison to nil in 2010, and settlement of loans made to our former joint venture in Russia, NSF, and its owner, related to the divestment of our shareholding in that entity.
Total_free cash _flow
Our total free cash flow increased by 72.6 million to an inflow of 22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to an outflow of 49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This change primarily resulted from an improvement in EBITDA, and a decrease in capital expenditure; as well as the fact that the European Commission fine of 57.7 million was paid in 2010.
