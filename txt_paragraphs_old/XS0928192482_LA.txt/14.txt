This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws of certain applicable jurisdictions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the discussion of the changing dynamics of the marketplace. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including terms such as "aim," "anticipate," "believe," "continue," "could," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "guidance," "intend," "may," "plan," "potential," "predict," "projected," "should" or "will" or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Offering Memorandum and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition and performance, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the industry in which we operate.
By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. The Issuer and the Guarantors caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on numerous assumptions and that our actual financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from (and be more negative than) those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to: > adverse changes in general economic conditions and/or tightening of credit markets; > our ability to improve our operational efficiency; > impact of any decline in net sales or profitability; > our ability to effectively compete in our highly competitive industry; > our ability to effectively identify and address consumer preferences; > increased price, or decreased availability, of raw materials and commodities we use to produce our products; > loss of one or more of our key customers; > disruption in our supply chain; > fluctuations in currency exchange rates; > our ability to adapt to changes in our distribution channels; > exposure to local business risk in many different countries; > reputation of, and value associated with, our brand names; > disruption caused by labor disputes; > business risk with pursuing further acquisitions; > distribution arrangements with unaffiliated third parties; > our ability to retain or attract key personnel and other highly skilled employees; > disruptions in our information technology systems; > our ability to successfully manage future growth efforts; > our ability to comply with current or existing environmental laws, health and safety regulations and antitrust laws;
> our exposure to risk from legal proceedings; > infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property; > costs arising from warranty and product liability claims; > our ability to service our existing and any future indebtedness; > risks relating to our capital structure, the Notes, the Guarantees and the security and the enforceability thereof or judgments in
respect thereof; and > other factors discussed in this Offering Memorandum.
