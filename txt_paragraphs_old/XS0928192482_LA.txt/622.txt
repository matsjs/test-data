The Group has several different pension plans in accordance with local conditions and practices where it operates. The plans are generally funded through payments to insurance companies.
F-58
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by the independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, combined with adjustments for unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and past service cost. Past service costs are charged immediately to the income statement to the extent that the benefits have vested, and are otherwise recognized on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits vest. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, changes in actuarial assumptions and amendments to plans are recognized through OCI in shareholders' equity.
Share-based payments
Sanitec has no share-based payments as defined in IFRS 2 during the financial years reported in these financial statements.
Assets classified as held-for-sale
Non-current assets and discontinued operations are classified as held-for-sale and stated at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, if their carrying value is recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. The sale should be considered highly probable.
A discontinued operation is a part of the entity that has been divested or classified as being held for sale and represents a separate core business area or geographic operation area.
Sanitec financial statements for 2011 do not include any non-current assets held-for-sale or any discontinued operation.
