The majority of management is bound by non-compete and non-solicitation (with respect to customers and other employees) obligations during 12 months after the cessation of their employment. The non compete provisions do not contain any express provision for compensation during the non-compete period.

(1) Comprising EQT IV (No.1) Limited Partnership (the "No.1 Partnership"); (2) EQT IV (No.2) Limited Partnership (the "No.2 Partnership"); (3) EQT IV GmbH & Co. KG (the "German Partnership"); and (4) the EQT IV co-investment scheme (the "Co-Investment Scheme" and together with the No. 1 Partnership, the No.2 Partnership and the German Partnership, "EQT IV"). The general partner of EQT IV is EQT IV Limited.
(2) In 2009, following our restructuring, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Frankfurt Branch, as security trustee on behalf of certain lenders, enforced certain security interests securing the then-existing senior and second lien liabilities, including the share pledge granted by Sanitec Holdings Oy (then holding company of the Group). As a consequence, 22.5% of our equity interests are owned indirectly by our former lenders or transferees thereof. The equity interests of our former lenders or transferees thereof are non-voting.
