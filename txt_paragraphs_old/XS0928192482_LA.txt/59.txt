EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered by investors in isolation from, or as a substitute for, or a measure of, profit, or as an indicator of our operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with IFRS. We have presented this supplemental non-IFRS information because we believe that it is a useful indicator of our ability to incur and service our indebtedness and can assist investors to evaluate our business. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are used by different companies for differing purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies. You should exercise caution in comparing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as reported by us to similar measures reported by other companies.
