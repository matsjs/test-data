The foreign exchange risk sensitivity analysis according to IFRS 7 for the most important currency pairs has been calculated for the Group's foreign currency nominated financial assets and liabilities, including foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at the reporting date. The foreign exchange risk sensitivity analysis represents the impact of a change in the foreign exchange rates of 10 percent to the statement of income and to the equity on the balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value reserve are caused by change in value of foreign exchange forwards designated as cash flow hedges. The effects of 10% appreciation in the most significant currency pairs on profit or loss statement and equity are presented in the tables below. The sensitivity analysis is based on the assumption that two months of the 12 months forecasted foreign exchange exposure is recognized in balance sheet.
