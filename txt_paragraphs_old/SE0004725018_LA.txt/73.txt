12.12 Limitation on Certain Asset Sales
(a) The Issuer shall not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:
(i) the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed;
(ii) such fair market value is determined in good faith by the Issuer's board of directors and evidenced by a resolution of the Issuer's board of directors delivered to the Bond Trustee. In the case of the sale of Surplus Buses, such officer's certificate shall be delivered to the Bond Trustee within thirty (30) calendar days after completion of the sale of any Surplus Buses;
(iii) at least 75 per cent of the consideration therefore received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of Sale Cash Equivalents and is received at the time of such issuance, sale or disposition. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be "Sale Cash Equivalents":
(A) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuer's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet), of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in right of payment to the Bonds) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to a customary novation agreement that releases the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities;
(B) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are (subject to ordinary settlement periods) converted within 30 days by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the Cash Equivalents received in that conversion);
(iv) such Asset Sale is made in compliance with the Transaction Security Documents or, in the case of pledged assets, with the consent of the Security Agent.
