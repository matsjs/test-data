(c) If any Non-Recourse Debt of an Unrestricted Subsidiary ceases to be NonRecourse Debt, such event will be deemed to constitute an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer.
(d) For purposes of determining compliance with this Clause 12.6, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in paragraphs (b)(i) through (b)(xi) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Clause 12,6, the Issuer (i) will be permitted to classify such item of indebtedness on the date of its incurrence in any manner that complies with this Clause 12.6 and (ii) may from time to time reclassify such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this Clause 12.6, in each case without duplication.
(e) For purposes of determining compliance with any Swedish Kronor denominated restriction on the incurrence of indebtedness denominated in another currency, the SEK principal amount of all Indebtedness will be calculated based on the Issuing Agent's Spot Rate of Exchange in effect on the date of such incurrence; provided that, if any Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than SEK is subject to a currency hedging agreement covering all principal, premium, if any, and interest payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such'Indebtedness expressed in SEK will be as provided in such currency hedging agreement. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated based on the Issuing Agent's Spot Rate of Exchange in effect on the date of such refinancing applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated.
