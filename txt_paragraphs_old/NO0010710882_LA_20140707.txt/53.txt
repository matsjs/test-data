Partial payments
If the Bond Trustee or the Paying Agent receives a payment that is insufficient to discharge all the amounts then due and payable under the Finance Documents, that payment shall be applied in the following order:
(a) first, in or towards payment of any unpaid fees, costs and expenses of the Bond Trustee under the Finance Documents ("Bond Trustee Expenses");
(b) secondly, in or towards payment of any accrued interest due but unpaid under the Bond Agreement, pro rata and without any preference or priority of any kind; and

(c) thirdly, in or towards payment of any principal due but unpaid under the Bond Agreement, pro rata and without any preference or priority of any kind.
In case the Issuer does not pay the Bond Trustee for incurred fees, then the Bond Trustee may seek funding of the Bond Trustee Expenses from other sources, in which case such other sources will be subrogated into the position of the Bond Trustee, but subordinate any further Bond Trustee Expenses.
