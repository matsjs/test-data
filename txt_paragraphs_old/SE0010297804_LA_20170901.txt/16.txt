(b) at any time after such listing, the Notes cease to be listed on the corporate bond list of Nasdaq Stockholm (or another Regulated Market), as applicable, save that if the Notes are listed on another market place than Nasdaq Stockholm, the Issuer may always apply for a change of listing to Nasdaq Stockholm).
"Make Whole Amount" means, from the First Issue Date to, but not including, the First Call Date, a price equivalent to the sum of: (a) the present value on the relevant record date of 102.075 per cent. of the Total
Nominal Amount as if such payment originally should have taken place on the First Call Date; and (b) the present value on the relevant record date of the remaining coupon payments (assuming that the interest rate for the period from the relevant redemption date to the First Call Date will be equal to the interpolated SEK mid-swap rate for the remaining term from the redemption date until the First Call Date), less any accrued but unpaid interest, through and including the First Call Date,
each calculated by using a discount rate of 50 basis points over the comparable Swedish government bond rate (i.e. comparable to the remaining duration of the Notes until the First Call Date) and where "relevant record date" shall mean a date agreed upon between the Agent, the CSD and the Issuer in connection with such repayment.
