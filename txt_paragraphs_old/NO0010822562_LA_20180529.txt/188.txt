whose senior credit participations aggregate more than 66 2/3% of (i) the Bonds, (ii) the RCF Facility and (iii) the Permitted Hedging, respectively.

Each Senior Creditor may amend or waive the terms of the finance documents for the Senior Secured Obligations owed to such Senior Creditor (other than the Senior Intercreditor Agreement or any Senior Security Documents) in accordance with their terms at any time.
