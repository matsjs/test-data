1. Consent. The Purchasers and the Lenders consent to each other's security and confirm that the security granted in favour of the other is not prohibited by the agreements and other documentation governing their respective relationship with the Seller, the Borrower, and Nemaska Lithium Inc. ("Parent") and its subsidiaries holding a direct or indirect interest in the Project (such subsidiary entities, together with the Seller and the Borrower, the "Project Entities"). The Purchasers and the Lenders also agree not to contest the security in favour of the other so long as it is consistent with the principles hereunder.
3. Ranking. The Loan Security and Loan Obligations shall be senior in all respects and prior to the Stream Security and Stream Obligations (whether or not the Loan Security is subordinated to any security interests and hypothec securing any other obligations of Parent or the Project Entities) and the Stream Security and Stream Obligations shall be junior and subordinate in all respects to the Loan Security and Loan Obligations. The Purchasers shall not be entitled to any proceeds of realization of any collateral secured by either the Stream Security or the Loan Security or any distributions or payments under any Insolvency Plan (as defined below) or any similar proceeding or arrangement unless and until the Loan Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full, and the Purchasers shall hold any such proceeds or distributions received in trust for the Lenders and forthwith pay such funds to the Lenders.
4. Stream Deliveries: Repayment of Deposit. The Lenders will acknowledge that all obligations of the Project Entities to the Purchasers with respect to net credits or in kind deliveries of spodumene concentrate and refined lithium products pursuant to the Stream Agreement (the "Stream Products") reflect a pre-paid forward purchase obligation of the Project Entities. In all cases, the Purchasers will be entitled, pursuant to the terms of the Stream Agreement, to (a) the Stream Products to be delivered to the Purchasers pursuant to the Stream Agreement and, unless the Purchasers have taken physical delivery of such Stream Products, all proceeds thereof, and (b)the amount of all Stream Products which, pursuant to the terms of the Stream Agreement, should have
been delivered to or for the benefit of the Purchasers but which was not delivered or which was used for another purpose in contravention of the Stream Agreement, and all proceeds thereof. Deliveries of Stream Products under the Stream Agreement shall not be subject to stoppage at any time by the Lenders pursuant to the Loan Agreement and other loan documentation (the "Loan Documentation"). While any amounts remaining owing to the Lenders, no deposit paid by the Purchasers pursuant to the Stream Agreement may be returned or repaid to the Purchasers other than by way of depletions of the uncredited balance as partial payment for deliveries of Stream Products and the reduction in the uncredited balance resulting from the exercise by Seller of its buy down rights under the Stream Agreement. For so long as any amounts are outstanding under the Loan Agreement, the Purchasers will not take any action that results in receipt by the Purchasers prior to the repayment in full of all amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement of any accelerated repayment of the deposit or any default or damages amounts under the Stream Agreement beyond (i) insurance proceeds referenced in Section 14 below, and (ii) amounts in respect of what was scheduled to be received (but was not received) in the ordinary course pursuant to the Stream Agreement in accordance with the last sentence of Section 5 below.
Enforcement. The Lenders shall (in accordance with the provisions to such effect in the Loan Documentation) have the exclusive entitlement to exercise rights and remedies in respect of the collateral or take or commence any enforcement or insolvency action following the occurrence of an event of default (an "Enforcement Action") and during a Standstill Period (defined below). A standstill period (the "Standstill Period") will apply to the Purchasers and automatically begin upon the existence of an event of default under the Stream Agreement, and may otherwise be initiated by the Lenders at any time following the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement by giving written notice of same to the Purchasers, and shall end on the date which is 180 days after the earlier of (a) the date on which the Purchasers declared the existence of an event of default under the Stream Agreement and provided notice of same to the Lenders (or their collateral agent), and (b) the date on which the Lenders (or their collateral agent) provided the Purchasers with written notice of the Standstill Period, or such longer period during which the Lenders are diligently pursuing the exercise of their rights and remedies by means of an Enforcement Action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchasers may, at any time, including during a Standstill Period, (i) file a proof of claim in any insolvency proceeding, (ii) file responsive or defensive pleadings to any objections to the Purchasers' claim in connection with an insolvency proceeding, (iii) issue a notice of default to Parent or a Project Entity, (iv) issue any statutory notices required in connection with the Stream Security at any time after such statutory notices have been issued by the Lenders (or any receiver appointed by it) in connection with the Loan Security, (v) issue any demand for payment of Parent's or a Project Entity's obligations to the Purchasers, (vi) terminate the Stream Agreement and trigger liquidated damages thereunder after the earlier of (x) the Lenders have accelerated such the obligations under the Loan Documentation or otherwise taken any Enforcement Action, (y) the end of the Standstill Period, or (z) the Parent or any Project Entity voluntarily commenced, or having been petitioned into, any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, or (vii) vote a claim after the occurrence of an insolvency event in a manner consistent with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, (viii) take any action required to preserve the validity, efficacy or subordinated position of the Stream Agreement or the Stream Security, including the commencement or initiation of any action required to comply with statutory limitation periods, provided that in each case the Purchasers shall take no further steps, actions or proceedings in furtherance of such actions and no such actions shall impede upon the Lenders' ability to take or continue any Enforcement Action. For greater certainty, the Purchasers may also in all cases seek remedies intended to ensure performance by the Project Entities of their Stream Products delivery obligations under the Stream Agreement or to segregate and maintain the identifiability of the Stream Products to be delivered thereunder or to trace any Stream Products the Project Entities failed to deliver on account of the Stream Obligations, provided that such actions or remedies do not impede upon the Lenders' ability to take or continue any Enforcement Action.

Enforcement Action. If the Purchasers have not terminated the Stream Agreement: (a) to the extent
that the Lenders foreclose on all or any material part of the Project assets for the purpose of
continuing to mine or extract Stream Products from the Mine (or for the purpose of ultimately,
