8. Purchase Right. Following notice by the Lenders of any intention to take an Enforcement Action, the Purchasers shall have the right to purchase the obligations under the Loan Agreement for an amount equal to the Loan Obligations outstanding at the time of the purchase (including, for greater certainty, all interest, costs and penalties). The Purchasers' election to purchase the Loan Obligations shall be exercised in writing and shall be completed (with payment of the purchase price) within ten (10) business days following such election being delivered, upon terms to be agreed upon and attached as a schedule to the Intercreditor Agreement. Unless and until the purchase right is completed, the granting of the purchase right and the delivery of an election to exercise the purchase right shall not in any way limit or restrict the Lenders rights under the Intercreditor Agreement, including the right to take or continue any Enforcement Action.
New Liens. If the Purchasers shall acquire or hold any lien or hypothec on any assets of Parent or any
of its subsidiaries securing Stream Obligations which assets are not also subject to the lien or
hypothec of the Lenders under the Loan Documentation, then (i) such lien or hypothec and such
assets shall be deemed to be subject to the terms of the Initial Intercreditor Agreement (as defined
below) and (ii) Parent or such subsidiary, as applicable, shall promptly grant (and will be deemed to
have granted) such lien or hypothec to the Lenders and the Purchaser will be deemed to hold such
lien or hypothec in trust for the Lenders until such lien or hypothec is granted to the Lenders.
10. Cross-Default. The Loan Agreement and the Stream Agreement will be cross-defaulted to each other.
