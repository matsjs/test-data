(a) the principal amount under the Bond Issue (excluding hedging liabilities related thereto) shall not exceed USD [350,000,000] (plus premium, accrued and unpaid interest, fees and costs) (or the equivalent thereof in any other currency);
(c) the aggregate negative mark to market value of all Permitted Hedging shall not exceed USD 10,000,000 (or the equivalent in any other currency).
For the avoidance of doubt, should (i) the obligations arising out of the RCF Facility or the Permitted Hedging at any time exceed the relevant limitation set out above, or (ii) the aggregated outstanding principal amount under the RCF Facility at any time, when aggregated with the principal outstanding amount under the Bond Issue and all Permitted Hedging, exceed the "Senior Secured Cap", any such excess sum will not
be included in the Senior Secured Obligations.
6. Appointment of security trustee and power of attorney:
The Senior Creditors will appoint and authorise the Security Trustee to hold and to act as their agent in respect of the Senior Security Documents, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
The Security Trustee shall also be authorised to, on behalf of the Senior Creditors, negotiate, execute and sign the Junior Intercreditor Agreement and any tripartite agreement with the counterparty under certain Project Documents (including Offtake Contracts) (of which some will be entered into by a member of the Debtor Group in the future), on terms consistent with (in respect of the Junior Intercreditor Agreement) Schedule 8 to the Bond Terms and (in respect of any other tripartite agreement or similar) the terms set out in the Bond Terms and otherwise accepted market practice in Canada for project financing of a resource based project (including in relation to performance, security, notice, termination, stepin, variations and assignment), and continue to represent and take the necessary actions (or non-actions) agreed in the Junior Intercreditor Agreement on behalf of the Senior Creditors (from time to time).
Any change of security trustee shall require the consent of the Trustee and the RCF Agent. The Trustee shall be authorised (in its sole discretion) to grant such consent without any approval or consent from the Bondholders. Before the appointment of a security trustee other than the Trustee, the Issuer shall be given the opportunity to state its views on the proposed security trustee, but the final decision as to appointment shall lie exclusively with the Trustee.
