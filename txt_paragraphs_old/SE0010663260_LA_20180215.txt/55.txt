(ii) any cash balance/proceeds resulting from the incurrence of such new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt.
The figures for EBITDA for the Relevant Period ending in the last day of the period covered by the most recent Financial Report (including when necessary, financial statements published before the First Issue Date), shall be used, but adjusted so that:
33
(a) entities acquired or disposed of by the Group during the Relevant Period, or after the end of the Relevant Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be included or excluded (as applicable), pro forma, for the entire Relevant Period;
(b) any entity to be acquired with the proceeds from the new Financial Indebtedness shall be included, pro forma, for the entire Relevant Period; and
(c) the full run rate effect of all cost savings and cost synergies reasonably projected by the Issuer as being obtainable during the twelve (12) month period following the date of the completion of such acquisition shall be taken into account, provided that the aggregate amount of such cost savings and cost synergies may (for such purposes) not exceed the higher of:
(i) EUR 1,300,000; and
(ii) ten (10) per cent. of the pro forma EBITDA (as per (a) above) in the Relevant Period,
unless the aggregate amount of such cost savings and cost synergies is independently verified by the auditor or a reputable independent third party advisor to the Issuer (and a copy of the relevant report providing such certification must be delivered with the relevant Compliance Certificate) in which case the aggregate amount of such cost savings and cost synergies shall be as set out in such report.
