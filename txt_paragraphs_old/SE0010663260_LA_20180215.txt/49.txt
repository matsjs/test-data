(iii) ensure that each Group Company promptly does all such acts and executes and supplies all such documents (including, without limitation, any Transaction Security Document and any document to be executed or supplied in relation thereto) as the Security Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of establishing the Post Disbursement Transaction Security.
(d) Unless and until the Security Agent has received instructions from the Instructing Party (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) to the contrary, the Security Agent may (without first having to obtain the Bondholders' consent), be entitled (but not obliged) to enter into agreements with the Issuer or a third party or take any other actions, if it is, in the Security Agent's opinion, necessary for the purpose of maintaining, releasing or enforcing the Transaction Security or for the purpose of settling the Bondholders', the other Secured Parties' or the Issuer's rights to the Transaction Security, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and these Terms and Conditions and provided that such agreements or actions are not detrimental to the interests of the Bondholders.
(e) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent may release Transaction Security and Guarantees in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Security Documents, the Guarantee and Adherence Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any Transaction Security or Guarantee will always be released in such a way that does not affect the sharing between the Secured Parties of the remaining Transaction Security and Guarantees and/or the ranking and priority of the Secured Parties as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement.
