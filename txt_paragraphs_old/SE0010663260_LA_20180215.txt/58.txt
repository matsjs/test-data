(items (a) - (g) above are together and individually referred to as a "Restricted Payment"), provided however that a Restricted Payment (other than a loan to the Company) may be made by the Issuer, if:
(A) the Incurrence Test is met (calculated on a pro forma basis including the relevant Restricted Payment) and the aggregated amount of all Restricted Payments of the Group in any fiscal year (including the Restricted Payment in question) does not exceed fifty (50) per cent. of the Group's consolidated net profit for the previous fiscal year; or
(B) if and to the extent necessary to comply with mandatory provisions of the Swedish Companies Act relating to dividend distributions to minority shareholders, provided that, the Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, in such case shall ensure that any such dividends shall be paid at the lowest level allowed by applicable law;
(ii) such distribution consists of a group contribution, provided that no cash or other funds are transferred from the Parent as a result thereof (i.e. the group contributions are merely accounting measures), however so that group contributions made for tax netting purposes may be made by way of cash contributions, and provided that such distribution, net of the tax effect, is subsequently converted into or re injected as a shareholder's contribution to the Issuer as soon as practicably possible; or
(iii) such payment is made to the Parent for funding of administration and management costs limited to EUR 500,000 for any financial year.
Further, a PIK Debt Payment may be made by the Issuer if it is:
(i) made using the proceeds of Financial Indebtedness incurred pursuant to paragraph (l) of the definition of Permitted Financial Indebtedness; or
(ii) funded in whole with cash received in the form of unconditional shareholder contributions from a direct or indirect shareholder of the Issuer or Shareholder Loans.
