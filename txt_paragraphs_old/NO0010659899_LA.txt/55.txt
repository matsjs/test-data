(c) The enforcement of the Guarantee shall be limited pursuant to (a)(i) and (b) above, if, no later than 15 (fifteen) Business Days following a demand by the Bond Trustee to make a payment under the Guarantee (the "Enforcement Notice"), the managing directors) on behalf of the German Guarantor have confirmed in writing to the Bond Trustee which amount of such cross-stream and/or up-stream guarantee cannot be enforced as it would cause the Net Assets of the German Guarantor to be less than its respective registered share capital as provided in (a)(i) and (b) above (the "Net Assets Management Determination") and such confirmation is supported by a calculation in the form of a balance sheet taking into account the adjustments set out in (b) above, after delivery of which the Bond Trustee shall (subject to (f) through (k) below), only be entitled to enforce the Guarantee in respect of such amounts that, in accordance with the Net Assets Management Determination, do not cause the German Guarantor1s Net Assets to fall below (or fall further below) the amount of its respective registered share capital.
