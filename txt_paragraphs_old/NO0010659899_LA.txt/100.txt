19.5 Written Bondholders' resolutions (a) Anything which may be done by resolution of the Bondholders in a
Bondholders' Meeting may be done by written resolution without a Bondholders' Meeting, subject to the following conditions:
(i) Notice of a written resolution shall be given, and a copy of the resolution shall be circulated, to all Bondholders who would be entitled to attend a Bondholders' Meeting and vote thereon, in a form and manner acceptable to the Bond Trustee. The accidental omission to give notice to, or the non-receipt of a notice by, any Bondholder does not invalidate the passing of a resolution.
(ii) A written resolution is passed when it is signed by or on behalf of Bondholders who, at the date that the notice is given and the date when the resolution is signed:
(A) would be entitled to attend a Bondholders' Meeting and vote thereon; and
(B) represent such majority of votes as would be required if the resolution was voted on at a Bondholders' Meeting at which all Bondholders entitled to attend and vote thereat were present and voting.
(iii) A resolution in writing may be signed in any number of counterparts.
(iv) A resolution in writing made in accordance with this Bond Agreement is as valid as if it had been passed by the Bondholders in a Bondholders' Meeting, and any reference in any provision of this Bond Agreement to a Bondholders' Meeting at which a resolution is passed or to Bondholders voting in favour of a resolution shall be construed accordingly.
(b) For the purposes of this Clause 19.5, the effective date of the resolution is the date when the resolution is signed by or on behalf of the last Bondholder whose signature results in the necessary voting majority being achieved and any reference in any provision of this Bond Agreement to the date of passing of a resolution is, in relation to a resolution made in accordance with this Clause 19.5, a reference to such date.
