Trustee shall not be entitled to pay the proceeds from such enforcement to the
Determination is provided. If and to the extent that the Guarantee has been
enforced without regard to the limitation on enforcement because the amount
payable under the Guarantee resulting from the Auditor's Determination is
lower than the respective amount resulting from the Management
Determination, the Bond Trustee shall upon demand of the German Guarantor
repay the difference between the amount paid to the Bond Trustee and the
amount payable resulting from the Auditor's Determination. Any further
proceeds received by the Bond Trustee shall be passed onto the Bondholders.
