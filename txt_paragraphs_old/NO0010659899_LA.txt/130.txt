AGREED SECURITY PRINCIPLES 1. Considerations
In determining what Additional Guarantor Security Documents will be provided following the Senior Discharge Date in support of the obligations of the Obligors under the Finance Documents, the following matters will be taken into account. Security shall not be created or perfected to the extent that it would:
(a) result in any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference or thin capitalisation laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction;
(b) result in a significant risk to the officers of the relevant grantor of Security of contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or of civil or criminal liability; or
(c) result in costs that, in the reasonable opinion of the Bond Trustee, are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that Security.
For the avoidance of doubt, in these Agreed Security Principles, "cost" includes, but is not limited to, income tax cost, registration taxes payable on the creation or enforcement or for the continuance of any Security, stamp duties, out-of-pocket expenses, and other fees and expenses (including legal fees) directly incurred by the relevant grantor of Security or any of its direct or indirect owners, subsidiaries or affiliates.
