case, other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) or, unless included in clause (a)(i), any other Senior Indebtedness; or (iv) to purchase the Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);
(b) to the extent the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or purchase or commit to invest in or purchase Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day;
(c) to make a capital expenditure within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such capital expenditure made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day; or
(d) any combination of the foregoing,
provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.
