Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary which is a Significant Subsidiary shall Guarantee any Credit Facility of the Issuer or a Guarantor or any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect to a Credit Facility unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee is incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, rules regarding corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes but excluding any obligation under the Guarantee itself) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent required by applicable law or customary practice.
For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:
(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; provided that Indebtedness incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant cannot be reclassified;
(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities shall be deemed initially Incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant;
(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;
(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11) or (13) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit,

bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;
(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;
