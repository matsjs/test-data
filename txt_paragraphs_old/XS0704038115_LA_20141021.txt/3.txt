· be a general senior subordinated obligation of the relevant Guarantor;
· rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of that Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (increasing the subordinated intercompany loans made by MidCo to the Issuer);
· rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior subordinated obligations of that Guarantor;
· benefit from the security as set forth below under ``--Security''; and
· be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured Indebtedness of that Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such Indebtedness.
Payment under the Guarantee will be expressly subordinated in right of payment to the payment when due of all Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors (including Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging obligations). As a result of this subordination, holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Guarantor will be entitled to receive full payment on all obligations owed to them before any payment can be made to holders of the Notes in respect of the Guarantees. See ``Risk Factors-- Risks Related to Our Structure--The Notes Guarantees will be subordinated to the Group's existing and future senior debt.''

The obligations of a Guarantor incorporated in Sweden under its Guarantee of the Notes and the security provided as security for the obligations under the Notes by a company incorporated in Sweden will be limited if required by an application of the provisions of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen) regulating transfers of values (Sw. värdeöverföringar). The liability of each such Guarantor in respect of such obligations will only apply to the extent permitted by such provisions of the Swedish Companies Act.
Further, the obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law or capital maintenance regulations. See ``Risk Factors-- Risks Related to Our Structure--The Notes Guarantees and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability''.
