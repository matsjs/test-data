(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (``payment default''); or
(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the ``cross-acceleration provision''),
and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates SEK 250 million or more;
(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the ``bankruptcy provisions'');
(7) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of SEK 250 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the ``judgment default provision'');
(8) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of SEK 100 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days (the ``security default provisions''); and
(9) any Guarantee of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days (the ``guarantee provisions'').
However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) and (7) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.
