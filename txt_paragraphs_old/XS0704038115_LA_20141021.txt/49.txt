Merger and Consolidation
The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:
(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the ``Successor Company'') (if not the Issuer) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, or the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;
(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional SEK 1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'' or (b) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would not be greater than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and
(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to any matters of fact.
Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness''.
For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.
