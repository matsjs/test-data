(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture and the proceeds therefrom are applied as required by the Indenture,
Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Guarantor or the Issuer and (b) any Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Guarantor or the Issuer. Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Guarantor reincorporating the Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Guarantor.
There is no precise established definition of the phrase ``substantially all'' under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve ``all or substantially all'' of the property or assets of a Person.
Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status
If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a ``Suspension Event''), then, the Issuer shall notify the Trustee of these events and beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the ``Reversion Date''), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes: ``-- Limitation on Restricted Payments'', ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'', ``-- Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries'', ``-- Limitation on Affiliate Transactions'', ``-- Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock'', the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Merger and Consolidation'' and ``-- Impairment of Security Interests'' and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the ``-- Limitation on Restricted Payments'' covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at the Issuer's option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
198
described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'' or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'', such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness''.
Impairment of Security Interests
The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged, amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents and/or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; provided, however, that, except with respect to any discharge, amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement in accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or any action expressly permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents may not be discharged, amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such discharge, amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such discharge, amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so discharged, amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such discharge, amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.
