(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;
(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.
If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly instruct its authenticating agent to authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice with respect to the results of the Change of Control Offer as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).
The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder's right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder's Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event.
The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of
178
such Change of Control and the absence of a Rating Decline, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.
The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.
