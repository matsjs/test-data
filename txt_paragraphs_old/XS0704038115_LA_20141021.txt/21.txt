The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee (or to a holder or beneficial owner upon written request), within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. Upon reasonable request, copies of Tax receipts or other evidence of payments, as the case may be, will be made available by the Trustee to the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes.
The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of such Person on the Notes or any Guarantee and any political subdivision thereof or therein.
Change of Control
If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading ``Change of Control'', each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to 100,000 or an integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this heading, ``Change of Control'', in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described under ``--Optional Redemption'' or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.
Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under ``--Optional Redemption'' or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will send a notice (the ``Change of Control Offer'') to each Holder of any such Notes by mail or otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee:
(1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the ``Change of Control Payment'');
177
(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) and the record date (the ``Change of Control Payment Date'');
(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;
