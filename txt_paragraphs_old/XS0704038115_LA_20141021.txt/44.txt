The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being ``Affiliate Transactions'') involving aggregate value in excess of SEK 50 million unless:
(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and
(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of SEK 250 million, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above; and
(3) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate consideration in excess of SEK 500 million, the Issuer has received a written opinion (a ``Fairness Opinion'') from an Independent Financial Advisor that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or that the terms are not materially less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's-length basis from a Person that is not an Affiliate.
The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:
(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Restricted Payments'', any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Restricted Payments'' or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b), (2) and (11) of the definition thereof);
(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants' plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of business;
(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;
