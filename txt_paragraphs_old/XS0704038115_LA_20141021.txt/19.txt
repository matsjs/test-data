(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);
