release of the Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or a Guarantor that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under ``Amendments and Waivers'', and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Restricted Payments''.
The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
