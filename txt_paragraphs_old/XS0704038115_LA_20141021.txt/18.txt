Redemption for Taxation Reasons
(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction (as defined in the ``Withholding Taxes'' section below) which change or amendment is announced and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date); or
(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or application of such laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which amendment or change is announced and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date).
The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes was then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that there has been such amendment or change which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that (a) it or the relevant Guarantor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) in the case of a Guarantor, such amounts cannot be paid by the Issuer or any other Guarantor without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts.
The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Notes.
For the avoidance of doubt, the implementation of European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive will not be a change or amendment for such purposes.
The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer is incorporated or organized, engaged in business or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of such Person on the Notes and any political subdivision thereof or therein.
Withholding Taxes
All payments made by the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors with respect to any Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future tax, duty, levy, assessment or other governmental charge, including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax (``Taxes'') unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is then incorporated or organized,
