(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that (i) if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Guarantee of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, any such guarantee of the Issuer or a Guarantor with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor's Guarantee of the Notes, as applicable, substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or the Guarantee of the Notes of such Guarantor, as applicable, and (ii) if such guarantee is of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Restricted Subsidiary complies with the third paragraph of this covenant; or

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer,
shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;
