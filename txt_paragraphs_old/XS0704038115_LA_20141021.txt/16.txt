``Bund Rate'' means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bunds or Bundesanleihen) with a constant maturity as officially compiled and published in the most recent financial statistics that has become publicly available at least two Business Days (but not more than five Business Days) prior to the redemption date (or, if such financial statistics are not so published or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the
Issuer in good faith)) most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to November 14, 2015; provided, however, that if the period from the redemption date to November 14, 2015 is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Federal Republic of Germany for which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany for which such yields are given, except that if the period from such redemption date to November 14, 2015 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.
General
Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under ``Selection and Notice'' below.
If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.
If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.
Sinking Fund
The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
