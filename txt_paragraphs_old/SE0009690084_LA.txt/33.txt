(d) The Trustee shall be entitled to give instructions relating to the Transaction Security and the Guarantee to the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement (if any).
The Security Agent may at any time, acting on instructions of the Working Capital Facility Provider (if the Working Capital Facility Provider has entered into the Intercreditor Agreement (if any)) and the Trustee (acting on behalf of the Bondholders), release Transaction Security and the Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Guarantee Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement (if any). For the avoidance of doubt any Transaction Security or Guarantee will always be released pro rata between the Bondholders and the Working Capital Facility Provider (if any) and the remaining Transaction Security will continue to rank pari passu between the Bondholders and the Working Capital Facility Provider (if any) as set forth in the Security Documents, the Guarantee Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement (if any).
10.3 Enforcement of Security and Guarantee
(a) The Trustee may only take any action to accelerate or enforce any Transaction Security or Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (if any). The Intercreditor Agreement (if any) will contain a stand still provision (binding upon the Bondholders) relating to the enforcement of the Transaction Security and the Guarantee.
(b) Upon an enforcement of the Transaction Security and/or the Guarantee, the proceeds shall be distributed in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement (if any) or with Clause 15 (Distribution of Proceeds).
(c) All security and/or guarantees or arrangement having similar effects may be released by the Security Agent, without the need for any further referral to or authority from anyone, upon any enforcement provided that the proceeds are distributed in accordance with the provisions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (if any).
