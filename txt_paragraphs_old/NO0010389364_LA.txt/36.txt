14.4 In the event of a bonus issue of new Shares (with the exception of shares issued in settlement of a merger offer), split or consolidation, the new Conversion Price shall be fixed as follows:
number of shares after bonus issue, split or consolidation
In the event that the shares are split into more than one class of shares, the conversion right shall be adjusted so that Bondholders' interest in the separate share classes remains unchanged, regardless of whether the Bondholder elects to convert prior to, or after the date on which the shares are quoted post split.
A bonus issue writing up the par value of the shares in the Borrower shall have no influence of the Conversion Price.
14.5 Should the Borrower make a dividend payment to shareholders of the Borrower, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted according to the principles of Clause 14.3.
14.6 If changes are made in the share capital other than those mentioned in Clauses 14.114.5 above, which are unfavourable to the Bondholders compared to the shareholders, the Loan Trustee and the Borrower shall agree on a new Conversion Price. This also applies to other transactions, which are unfavourable to the Bondholders. The principles expressed in Clauses 14.1 to Clause 14.5 above shall always be the basis for any adjustments pursuant to this Clause.
14.7 If the Conversion Price is below par value of the Shares, the par value of the Shares shall be applied for the purpose of conversion and the Borrower shall upon conversion pay the Bondholders the difference between the par value of the Shares and the Conversion Price.
14.8 If an adjustment of the Conversion Price requires a conversion to USD, the exchange rate shall be the official reference rate provided by the European Central Bank on the date triggering such adjustments.
