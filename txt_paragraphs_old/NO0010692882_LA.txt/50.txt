The redemption notice shall be provided no later than 10 business days prior to the redemption date. For the avoidance of doubt, the redemption price shall be determined based on the date the Mandatory Prepayment Event occurred and not based on the date the repayment is carried out.
Upon a Total Loss, the Issuer shall, on the earlier of (i) the date of receipt of insurance proceeds or (ii) the date occurring 180 days after the date of the Total Loss, redeem 100% of the outstanding Bonds at 101% of par value (plus accrued interest on the redeemed amount).
