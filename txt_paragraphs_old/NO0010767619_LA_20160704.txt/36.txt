13.3 Continuation of business The Issuer shall ensure that no Group Company shall cease to carry on its business, if such transaction would have a Material Adverse Effect. The Issuer shall procure that no material change is made to the general nature or scope of the business of the Group from that carried on by the Group at the Issue Date, or as contemplated by the Bond Agreement.
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that no other Group Company will, carry out:
(i) any merger or other business combination or corporate reorganization involving consolidating the assets and obligations of such Group Company with any other company or entity not being a member of the Group if such transaction would have a Material Adverse Effect; or
(ii) any demerger or other corporate reorganization involving splitting a Group Company into two or more separate companies or entities, if such transaction would have a Material Adverse Effect.
13.5 Financial support
The Issuer shall ensure that no Group Company shall grant any loans, guarantees or other financial assistance (including, but not limited to granting security) to any third party not being a member of the Group, other than in ordinary course of business.
13.6 Disposals
The Issuer shall ensure that no Group Company shall be entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of all or a substantial part of its assets or operations, unless the transaction is carried out at a fair market value, on terms and conditions customary for such transactions; and such transaction would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
13.7 Related party transactions The Issuer shall not engage in, or permit any member of the Group to engage in, directly or indirectly, any transaction with any party (without limitation, the purchase, sale or exchange of assets or the rendering of any service), except in the ordinary course of business and pursuant to the reasonable requirement of the Issuer's or such member of the Group's business and upon fair and reasonable terms that are no less favourable to the Issuer or such member of the Group, as the case may be, than those which might be obtained in an arm's length transaction at the time.
