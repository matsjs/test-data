(b) no Event of Default is continuing or would occur upon the Restricted Payment.
The calculation of the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no more than three months prior to the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness or making of a Restricted Payment. The Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date so determined, but include the new Financial Indebtedness provided it is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt). The cash position shall be measured on the relevant testing date so determined reduced with the relevant Restricted Payment. EBITDA shall be in accordance with the latest Financial Report and be further calculated as set out below.
13.4 Adjustments
(a) The figures for EBITDA, Finance Charges and Net Finance Charges for the Reference Period ending on the last day of the period covered by the most recent financial report shall be used for the Incurrence Test (as applicable), but adjusted so that:
(i) entities acquired or disposed of by the Group during the Reference Period, or after the end of the Reference Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be included or excluded (as applicable), pro forma, for the entire Reference Period; and
(ii) any entity to be acquired with the proceeds from new Financial Indebtedness shall be included, pro forma, for the entire Reference Period.
(b) Any liability under any leases for premises shall be excluded or included as Net Interest Bearing Debt, as selected by the Issuer, from the inception of IFRS 16 and thereafter consistently applied.
