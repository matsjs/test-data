3. Limitation on Liens
So long as any Note remains outstanding, the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Material Subsidiary to, create, incur or assume any Indebtedness secured by any Lien on any property, without making effective provision whereby the Notes (together with, if the Issuer shall so determine, any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Material Subsidiary then existing or thereafter created which is not subordinate to the Notes) will be secured equally and ratably with (or, at the option of the Issuer or such Material Subsidiary, prior to) such Indebtedness. Notwithstanding the above, the foregoing limitations will not apply to the following Liens (each a ''Permitted Lien''):
(a) Liens existing prior to the date of the Agency Agreement (each such Lien, an ''Existing Lien'');
(b) Liens created in connection with an acquisition or the development of property or assets acquired or developed after the date of the Agency Agreement, provided, that any such Lien shall be restricted solely to such property or assets and that any such Lien shall be created within 180 days of the acquisition or development of such property or assets (each such Lien, a ''Purchase Money Lien'');
(c) any Lien existing on (i) any property of any entity at the time such entity becomes a Material Subsidiary or (ii) any property at the time such property is acquired by the Issuer or a Material Subsidiary, but only, in the case of either (i) or (ii), if and so long as (A) such Lien was not created in contemplation of such entity becoming a Material Subsidiary or such property being acquired, and (B) such Lien is and shall remain confined to the property subject to it at the time such entity becomes a Material Subsidiary or such property is acquired and to fixed improvements thereafter erected on such property (each such Lien, a ''Pre-Acquisition Lien'');
