6. Interest
The Notes bear interest from October 2, 2003 (the ''Issue Date''), at the rate of 6.125% per annum, (the ''Rate of Interest''), payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 in each year (each, an ''Interest Payment Date''), commencing on April 15, 2004, subject as provided in Condition 8 (Payments).
Each Note will cease to bear interest from the due date for redemption unless, upon due presentation, payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused, in which case it will continue to bear interest at such rate (both before and after judgment) until whichever is the earlier of (a) the day on which all sums due in respect of such Note up to that day are received by or on behalf of the relevant Noteholder and (b) the day which is five days after the Fiscal Agent has notified the Noteholders that it has received all sums due in respect of the Notes up to such fifth day (except to the extent that there is any subsequent default in payment).
