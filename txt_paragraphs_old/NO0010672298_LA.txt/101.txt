(a) At the Bondholders' Meeting each Bondholder may cast one vote for each Voting Bond of the relevant Issue owned at close of business on the day prior to the date of the Bondholders' Meeting in accordance with the records registered in the Securities Depository. Whoever opens the Bondholders' Meeting shall adjudicate any question concerning which Bonds shall count as Issuers' Bonds. Issuers' Bonds shall not have any voting rights. For this purpose, a Bondholder that has a Bond that is nominee registered shall be deemed as the Bondholder of such Bond (instead of the nominee) provided that the Bondholder presents relevant evidence stating that the relevant Bondholder is the Bondholder of the Bond and the amount of Bonds held by such Bondholder.
(b) In all matters, the Issuers, the Bond Trustee and any Bondholder have the right to demand vote by ballot. In case of parity of votes, the Chairman shall have the deciding vote, regardless of the Chairman being a Bondholder or not.
