INTEREST
Each Initial Note carries Interest at the Interest Rate from (and including) the First Issue Date up to (but excluding) the relevant Redemption Date. Any Subsequent Note will carry Interest at the Interest Rate from (and including) the Interest Payment Date falling immediately prior to its issuance up to (but excluding) the relevant Redemption Date.
Interest accrues during an Interest Period. Payment of Interest in respect of the Notes shall be made to the Noteholders on each Interest Payment Date for the preceding Interest Period.
Interest shall be calculated on the "actual/actual ICMA" basis as specified by the International Capital Market Association.
If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from (and including) the due date up to (but excluding) the date of actual payment at a rate which is two (2) percentage points higher than the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Agent, the Issuing Agent or the CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
