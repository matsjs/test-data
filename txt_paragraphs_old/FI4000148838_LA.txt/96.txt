Any notice that the Issuer or the Agent shall send to the Noteholders pursuant to Clauses 16.1 and 17.1 shall also be published by a notice published in Kauppalehti, Helsingin Sanomat or any other major Finnish newspaper selected by the Issuer, or if applicable, the Agent. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been received by the Noteholders when published in any manner specified in this Clause 22.2.1.
FORCE MAJEURE AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Neither the Issuer, the Agent nor the Issuing Agent shall be held responsible for any damage arising out of any legal enactment, or any measure taken by a public authority, or war, strike, lockout, boycott, blockade or any other similar circumstance (a "Force Majeure Event"). The reservation in respect of strikes, lockouts, boycotts and blockades applies even if the Agent or the Issuing Agent itself takes such measures, or is subject to such measures.
The Issuing Agent shall have no liability to the Noteholders if it has observed reasonable care. The Issuing Agent shall never be responsible for indirect damage with exception of gross negligence and wilful misconduct.
Should a Force Majeure Event arise which prevents the Issuer, the Agent or the Issuing Agent from taking any action required to comply with these Terms and Conditions, such action may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed.
The provisions in this Clause 23 apply unless they are inconsistent with the provisions of the Book-Entry System Act which provisions shall take precedence.
