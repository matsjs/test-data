APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF THE AGENT
By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder, and, by acquiring Notes, each subsequent Noteholder:
(a) agrees to and accepts the appointment of the Agent to act as its agent and representative in all matters relating to the Notes and the Finance Documents, and authorises the Agent to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent, unless such consent is specifically required by these Terms and Conditions) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Notes held by such Noteholder including any legal or arbitration proceeding relating to the perfection, preservation, protection or enforcement of the Transaction Security and to exercise such rights, powers, authorities and discretions as are specifically delegated to the Agent by these Terms and Conditions and the Security Documents together with all such rights, powers, authorities and discretions as are incidental thereto; and
(b) agrees to and accepts that, upon the Agent delivering an acceleration notice in accordance with Clause 12.1, it will be considered to have irrevocably transferred to the Agent all its procedural rights and legal authority to claim and collect any and all receivables under the Notes, enforce any Transaction Security and to receive any funds in respect of the Notes or under the Security Documents (Fin: prokurasiirto) as a result of which transfer, the Agent shall be irrevocably entitled to take all such action in its own name but on behalf of and for the benefit of each Noteholder (at the expense of the Noteholders).
Each Noteholder shall immediately upon request provide the Agent with any such documents (in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent) that the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents. The Agent is under no obligation to represent a Noteholder which does not comply with such request if due to such failure the Agent is unable to represent such Noteholder.
The Issuer shall promptly upon request provide the Agent with any documents and other assistance (in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent), that the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents.
