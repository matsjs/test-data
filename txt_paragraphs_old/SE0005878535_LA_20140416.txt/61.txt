(viii) eighthly, after the Final Discharge Date (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), towards payment pro rata of accrued interest unpaid and principal under the Shareholder Debt (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement);
(x) tenthly, after the Final Discharge Date (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant ICA Group Company (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or other person entitled to it.
Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (i) to (x) above shall be paid to the Issuer.
(b) Funds that the Agent receives (directly or indirectly) in connection with the acceleration of the Notes or the enforcement of the Transaction Security and/or the Guarantees shall constitute escrow funds (redovisningsmedel) and must be promptly turned over to the Security Agent to be applied in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.
16. Decisions by Noteholders
(a) Any decision by the Noteholders on a matter relating to the Finance Documents shall (at the option of the Agent) be dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure.
(b) Any request from the Issuer or a Noteholder (or Noteholders) representing at least ten (10) per cent, of the Adjusted Nominal Amount (such request may only be validly made by a person who is a Noteholder on the Business Day immediately following the day on which the request is received by the Agent and shall, if made by several Noteholders, be made by them jointly) for a decision by the Noteholders on a matter relating to the Finance Documents shall be directed to the Agent and dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting or by way a Written Procedure, as determined by the Agent. The person requesting the decision may suggest the form for decision making, but if it is in the Agent's opinion more appropriate that a matter is dealt with at a Noteholders'
Meeting than by way of a Written Procedure, it shall be dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting.
The Agent may refrain from convening a Noteholders' Meeting or instigating a Written Procedure if (i) the suggested decision must be approved by any person in addition to the Noteholders and such person has informed the Agent that an approval will not be given, or (ii) the suggested decision is not in accordance with applicable laws.
