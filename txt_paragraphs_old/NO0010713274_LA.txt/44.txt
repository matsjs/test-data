In the event of any breach of Financial Covenants, the Issuer shall immediately give notice to the Bond Trustee, and the Issuer shall have the right to remedy the noncompliance within 30 Banking Days after the date of sending such notice or after the date on which such notice should have been sent. Remedy shall be made by receiving the required funds through equity or Subordinated Loans to the Issuer (on terms acceptable to the Bond Trustee) which shall be deposited (for the required period, which in any event shall not expire prior to the next reporting date of the Financial Covenants) on a separate account to be pledged but not blocked to the Bond Trustee and where the account bank has waived its set-off rights. If the Issuer has remedied the non-compliance of the Financial Covenants within said 30 Banking Days, no Event of Default shall have occurred under the Bond Agreement.

standards as shall be recommended from time to time by the IASB or (iii) Norwegian GAAP, or if there have been made any material changes to IAS, IFRS or Norwegian GAAP or the interpretation of such accounting principles; then the Issuer and the Trustee will conduct a review of the impact thereof on the Issuer's consolidated financial statements. Amendments satisfactory to the Trustee shall be made to the Financial Covenants (if necessary) in order to enable the Trustee to apply thereunder the same financial tests as set forth above as the Trustee would have been able to do had the Issuer continued to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with otherwise applicable accounting principles before such changes in accounting principles. The Trustee may ask any well reputed accountancy firm or investment bank to assist in the determination and may rely solely on such determination without a duty to examine the merits of the determination.
