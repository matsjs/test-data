"Business Day Convention" means that if the relevant Payment Date originally falls on a day that is not a Business Day, an adjustment of the Payment Date will be made
4/33
so that the relevant Payment Date will be the first following day that is a Business Day unless that day falls in the next calendar month, in which case that date will be the first preceding day that is a Business Day {Modified Following Business Day Convention).
"Cash and Cash Equivalent" means, the amounts (expressed in NOK or NOK equivalent) on such date of the then current market value of:
a) cash in hand or amounts standing to the credit of any current and/or on deposit accounts with an acceptable bank; and
b) time deposits with acceptable banks and certificates of deposit issued, and bills of exchange accepted, by an acceptable bank,
in each case, to which any Group Company is beneficially entitled at that time and to which any such Group Company has free and unrestricted access and which is not subject to any encumbrance. However, any amount standing to the credit of any pledged (but not blocked) earnings account of the Group shall be regarded as Cash and Cash Equivalents as long as no event of default (however described) has occurred under any finance document relating to any such pledge. An "acceptable bank" for this purpose is:
a) a commercial bank, savings bank and trust company which has a minimum "A" credit rating from S&P or Moody's or a comparable rating from a nationally recognized credit ranking agency for its long-term debt obligations; or
b) a bank or financial institution which is authorized to carry on banking business in Norway.
