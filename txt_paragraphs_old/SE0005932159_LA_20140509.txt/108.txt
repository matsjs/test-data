Clause 23.1 shall not apply if the Agent has been instructed by the Holders in accordance
with the Finance Documents to take certain actions but fails for any reason to take, or is

accordance with Clause 21.1.3), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such
failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by

failure must continue for at least 40 Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 21.2.9
