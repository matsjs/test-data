10.1.4 Bonds redeemed by the Issuer in accordance with this Clause 10.1 shall be discharged against the Outstanding Bonds.
If, prior to the Outstanding Bonds (plus any accrued and unpaid interest) having been redeemed in full, it has become evident, to the satisfaction of the Bond Trustee, that the basis for any further payment to the Bondholders (following a sale or other realisation of all assets of the Issuer and Refectio and distribution to the Bondholders) no longer exists, the Issuer shall in cooperation with the Bond Trustee be entitled to discharge the remaining Outstanding Bonds (and accrued and unpaid interest) without any further payments being made to the Bondholders in connection with a liquidation process of the Issuer and/or Refectio. Alternatively, the Bond Trustee may offer to the Bondholders to purchase their Outstanding Bonds at a price to be set in its own discretion to reflect that no further payments will be made to the Bondholders.
10.2 Change of control
10.2.1
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, each Bondholder shall have the right to require that the Issuer redeems its Bonds (a " Put Option") for its pro rata share of the Payoff Amount.
10.2.2
The Put Option must be exercised within two months after the Issuer has given notification to the Bond Trustee of a Change of Control Event. Such notification shall be given as soon as possible after a Change of Control Event has taken place.
10.2.3
The Put Option may be exercised by each Bondholder by giving written notice of the request to its Account Manager. The Account Manager shall notify the Paying Agent of the redemption request. The settlement date of the Put Option shall be the third Business Day after the end of the two month exercise period of the Put Option.
