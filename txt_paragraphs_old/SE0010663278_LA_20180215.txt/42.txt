(e) The Issuer is not liable to gross-up any payments under the Finance Documents by virtue of any withholding tax, public levy or the similar.
(a) Each Initial PIK Bond carries Interest at the Interest Rate from (but excluding) the First Issue Date up to (and including) the relevant Redemption Date. Any Subsequent PIK Bond will carry Interest at the Interest Rate from (but excluding) the Interest Payment Date falling immediately prior to its issuance up to (and including) the relevant Redemption Date.
(b) Interest shall be deferred until the relevant redemption date when the PIK Bond Issue has been repaid in full. Interest shall accrue on the amount of the deferred interest (the "Deferred Interest Amount") as if the Deferred Interest Amount had been added to the principal amount of the PIK Bonds and shall be compounded on each Interest Payment Date.
(c) Subject to subparagraph (b) above, Interest accrues during an Interest Period. Payment of Interest in respect of the PIK Bonds shall be made to the PIK Bondholders on each Interest Payment Date for the preceding Interest Period.
(d) Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve months of 30 days each and, in case of an incomplete month, the actual number of days elapsed (30/360-days basis).
25
(e) If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it under the Finance Documents on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from (but excluding) the due date up to (and including) the date of actual payment at a rate which is two (2) per cent. higher than the Interest Rate for such Interest Period. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the PIK Agent or the CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
