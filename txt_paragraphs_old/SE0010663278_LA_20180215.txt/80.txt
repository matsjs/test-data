(d) The PIK Agent is not obligated to assess or monitor the financial condition of the Issuer or compliance by the Issuer of the terms of the Finance Documents unless to the extent expressly set out in the Finance Documents, or to take any steps to ascertain whether any Event of Default (or any event that may lead to an Event of Default) has occurred. Until it has actual knowledge to the contrary, the PIK Agent is entitled to assume that no Event of Default (or any event that may lead to an Event of Default) has occurred.
(f) The PIK Agent shall treat all PIK Bondholders equally and, when acting pursuant to the Finance Documents, act with regard only to the interests of the PIK Bondholders and shall not be required to have regard to the interests or to act upon or comply with any direction or request of any other person, other than as explicitly stated in the Finance Documents.
(g) The PIK Agent is entitled to engage external experts when carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents and/or related documents. The Issuer shall on demand by the PIK Agent pay all costs for external experts engaged after the occurrence of an Event of Default, or for the purpose of investigating or considering (i) an event which the PIK Agent reasonably believes is or may

lead to an Event of Default, (ii) a matter relating to the Issuer which the PIK Agent reasonably believes may be detrimental to the interests of the PIK Bondholders under the Finance Documents or (iii) as otherwise agreed between the Issuer and the PIK Agent. Any compensation for damages or other recoveries received by the PIK Agent from external experts engaged by it for the purpose of carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents shall be distributed in accordance with Clause 17 (Distribution of Proceeds).
(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Finance Documents to the contrary, the PIK Agent is not obliged to do or omit to do anything if it would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of any law or regulation.
(i) If in the PIK Agent's reasonable opinion the cost, loss or liability which it may incur (including reasonable fees to the PIK Agent) in complying with instructions of the PIK Bondholders, or taking any action at its own initiative, will not be covered by the Issuer, or the PIK Bondholders (as applicable), the PIK Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with such instructions, or taking such action, until it has received such funding or indemnities (or adequate Security has been provided therefore) as it may reasonably require.
(j) Unless it has actual knowledge to the contrary, the PIK Agent may assume that all information provided by or on behalf of the Issuer (including by its advisors) is correct, true and complete in all aspects.
(k) The PIK Agent shall give a notice to the PIK Bondholders (i) before it ceases to perform its obligations under the Finance Documents by reason of the non payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the PIK Agent under the Finance Documents or the PIK Agency Agreement or (ii) if it refrains from acting for any reason described in Clause 22.3(i).
