13.3.3
Compliance with Financial Covenants
The Issuer undertakes to comply with the financial covenants as set out in Clauses 13.3.1 {Maximum Leverage Ratio) and 13.3.2 (Minimum Free Liquidity) at all times, such compliance to be measured on each Quarter Date and certified by the Issuer in the Compliance Certificate attached hereto in Schedule 1 in connection with each Financial Report on the respective Reporting Date. The financial covenants as set out in this clause 13.3 shall be calculated on a consolidated basis for the Group during the lifetime of the Bonds.
13.3.4
Leverage Ratio Covenant Cure
If the Issuer fails (or would otherwise fail) to comply with the Leverage Ratio at any time and the Issuer prior to the relevant Reporting Date has provided either (i) a Cure Vessel and Security in respect of such Cure Vessel along the principles applicable to the Vessels in accordance with Clause 2.5 {Transaction Security), or (ii) cash collateral deposited on a bank account pledged on first priority and blocked in favour of the Security Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties) bridging the value shortfall, then (a) if a Cure Vessel is provided, the Leverage Ratio shall be recalculated on the basis that the Market Value of such Cure Vessel shall be deemed to increase the total aggregate Market Value of the Vessels for the relevant period to which the breach relates and (b) if cash collateral is provided and for as long as such cash collateral remains in place, the Outstanding Bond Amount shall, for the purpose of the Leverage Ratio only, be deemed to be reduced by the amount of the cash collateral so provided.
If, after the Leverage Ratio is recalculated as set out above, the breach has been prevented or cured, the Leverage Ratio shall be deemed to have been satisfied from the last day of the reporting period covered by the financial statements to be delivered on the relevant Reporting Date. If a Cure Vessel or cash collateral has been provided in accordance with this Leverage Ratio Covenant Cure, the security arrangement or relevant cash deposit amount shall be released, or, as the case may be in respect of the cash collateral, partly-released, by the Security Agent at the request of the Issuer, if the Issuer to the satisfaction of the Bond Trustee has demonstrated that following such release or part-release, it will be in compliance with the Clause 13.3.1 {Maximum Leverage Ratio).
