(i) the Security Vessels are operated by the Vessel Managers in all material respects in accordance with applicable laws and regulations (including but not limited to applicable sanctions) and good industry practice;
(ii) no amendments, supplements, variations or waiver of any material terms of the Vessel Management Agreement to be made if any such amendment, supplement, variation or waiver would have a Material Adverse Effect; and

Approval from the Bond Trustee will not be required if a change is required and permitted pursuant to any Charter Contract for the relevant vessel, provided that the Transaction Security Documents are not impaired.
