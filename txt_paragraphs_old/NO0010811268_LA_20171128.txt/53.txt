The Incurrence Test is met if both:
(i) Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDAX is less than 3.Ox; and
(ii) EBITDAX / Interest Expense is at least 2.5x.
The calculation of the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDAX and the ratio of EBITDAX/Interest Expense shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no earlier than one month prior to the event relevant for the application of the Incurrence Test.
The calculation shall be made by taking into account the following principles:
(A) Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date so determined, and include commitments that will be drawn under new Financial Indebtedness (including as a result of any Tap Issue) in respect of which the Incurrence Test is applied (after deducting any Financial Indebtedness which will be refinanced at the time of incurrence of such new Financial Indebtedness);
(B) Any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of such new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt;
