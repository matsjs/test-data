Subsidiaries' distributions
Save for obligations under any Financial Indebtedness, the Issuer shall not permit any Subsidiary to create or permit to exist any contractual obligation (or encumbrance) restricting the right of any Subsidiary to:
(a) pay dividends or make other distributions to its shareholders;
(b) service any Financial Indebtedness to the Issuer;
(c) make any loans to the Issuer; or
(d) transfer any of its assets and properties to the Issuer;
if the creation of such contractual obligation is reasonably likely to prevent the Issuer from complying with any of its obligations under the Bond Terms.
