"Lease Debt" means the liabilities relating to (i) the sale and lease back agreement between the Issuer, Scandinavian Biogas Stockholm AB and Stockholm Vatten AB regarding the Henriksdal and Bromma production facilities (including the plants Linje 1, Linje 2 and Linje 3:0 and the properties Rötkammaren 2 and Reningsverket 2), and the lease agreement between the Scandinavian Biogas Recycling AB and SRV Återvinning AB regarding the pre-treatment plant in Södertörn (which liabilities in aggregate as of the 30 September 2015 amounted to SEK 172,006,000), in each case accounted for as interest bearing debt.
"Make Whole Amount" means a price equivalent to the sum of:
(a) the present value on the relevant record date of 105 per cent. of the Outstanding Nominal Amount as if such payment originally should have taken place on the First Call Date; and

each calculated by using a discount rate of 50 basis points over the comparable Swedish government bond rate (i.e. the rate for a comparable period from the relevant redemption date to the First Call Date) and where "relevant record date" shall mean a date agreed upon between the Trustee, the CSD and the Issuer in connection with such repayment.
