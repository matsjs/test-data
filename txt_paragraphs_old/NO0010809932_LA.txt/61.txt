The Issuer shall not, and shall ensure that no other Group Company shall, create, permit to subsist or allow to exist any Security over any of its present or future assets (including shares in the other Group Companies) or its revenues, other than the Permitted Security.
Save for obligations under the Permitted Financial Indebtedness, the Issuer shall not permit any Group Company to create or permit to exist any contractual obligation (or encumbrance) restricting the right of any Group Company to:
(i)
make any Distributions to its shareholders;
(ii) service any Financial Indebtedness to the Issuer;
(iii) make any loans to the Issuer; or
(iv) transfer any of its assets and properties to the Issuer;
if the creation of such contractual obligation would prevent the Issuer from complying with any of its obligations under the Bond Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and to the extent not prevented by any applicable legal prohibitions, restrictions on financial assistance, dividend restrictions or the incurrence of personal liability of management or shareholders, the Issuer shall procure that the Group Companies always make the required Distributions in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise to enable the Issuer to service its payment obligations under the Bonds.
