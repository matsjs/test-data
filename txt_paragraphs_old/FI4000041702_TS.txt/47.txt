Credit risk
No security
No one other than the Issuer and the Guarantor will accept any liability whatsoever in respect of any failure by the Issuer to pay any amount due under the Notes. The Notes are unsecured debt instruments and the holders would be unsecured creditors in the event of the Issuer's and/or the Guarantor's bankruptcy or reorganization. Claims of secured creditors will have priority, with respect to their security, over the claims of unsecured creditors, such as holders of the Notes.

Accordingly, any adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of the Issuer and/or the Guarantor may negatively impact the liquidity and the market prices for the Notes, and endanger the probability that the holder will receive the prompt and full payment, when due, for principal, interest and/or any other amounts and items payable to the holders pursuant to the Notes from time to time.
Other guarantee obligations o f the Guarantor
The Guarantor has also other guarantee obligations than the Guarantee under the Notes. Fulfilment of such other guarantee obligations by the Guarantor may decrease the ability of the Guarantor to make a full payment under the Guarantee to the holders of the Notes. Other guarantee obligations of the Guarantor may also be secured obligations and accordingly, claims under such secured guarantees will have priority over unsecured guarantee claims, such as the claims under the Guarantee.
Absence o f rating
The Notes and the Issuer are not currently rated by any rating agency.
