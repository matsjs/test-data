Selected Financial Information of the Guarantor The following selected financial information has been derived from the audited financial statements of the Guarantor for the year ended and as at 31 December 2011 and 2010 prepared in accordance with FAS. The consolidated financial statements of the Issuer including the financial information of the Guarantor for the year ended and as at 31 December 2011 and 2010 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The accounting principles applied to the Guarantor's FAS financial statements differ from the accounting principles applied to the Issuer's consolidated IFRS financial statements. Main differences relate to the accounting treatment of the perpetual capital loan, finance lease arrangements, hedge reserve and accumulated depreciation difference. The perpetual capital loan is unsecured and subordinated to all senior debt and is treated as equity in the Issuer's consolidated IFRS financial statements. In the Guarantor's FAS financial statements, the perpetual capital loan is treated as a non-current borrowing. The Guarantor has concluded lease agreements for mobile equipment, equipment related to power supply and materials handling equipment. In the Guarantor's FAS financial statements these lease arrangements have been treated as operating leases and rental expenses have been expensed as incurred. In the Issuer's consolidated IFRS financial statements these lease arrangements have been treated as finance leases, and acquisitions of property and equipment are capitalised at the commencement of the lease and depreciated over the useful life of the asset. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability. In the Issuer's consolidated IFRS financial statements, the hedge reserve includes the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument, net of tax. The Issuer ceased to apply hedge accounting on forecast nickel sales on 31 December 2009. At that time, amounts taken to hedge reserve remain in hedge reserve and they are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale occurs. In the Guarantor's FAS financial statements, the Issuer has not applied hedge accounting and gains or losses on hedging instruments have been recognized in income statement as incurred. Accumulated difference between the Guarantor's depreciation expense in the financial statements and in taxation is treated as appropriations (depreciation difference) in the FAS financial statements separately from the shareholders equity. Under IFRS, accumulated depreciation difference is not recorded as a separate line item but it is considered as a timing difference between taxbase and book base. In the Issuer's consolidated IFRS financial statements, the accumulated depreciation difference, net of tax, is treated as equity and related deferred tax liability is recorded against deferred tax assets.
