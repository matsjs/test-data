In January 2011, an Extraordinary General Meeting of Talvivaara resolved to approve the proposal of the Board of Directors for the issue of special rights in relation to 2015 Bonds. The value of the equity component for the 2015 Bonds was determined after resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting and it is recognised in equity. As at 31 December 2011, an equity component of EUR 9.0 million for the 2015 Bonds was recognised in equity.
In June 2010, Talvivaara signed a EUR 100 million three-year revolving multicurrency credit facility with Nordea, Svenska Handelsbanken AB (publ), Branch Operation in Finland ("Handelsbanken") and Sampo. The facility had a margin of 3.0 per cent until 31 December 2010 and thereafter a varying margin of 1.75 to 3.0 per cent depending on Talvivaara's leverage ratio. The facility is intended for general corporate purposes.
In October 2011, Talvivaara signed an amendment agreement to the EUR 100 million revolving credit facility agreement with Nordea, Sampo, Handelsbanken and Pohjola Bank plc ("Pohjola"). The facility was expanded to EUR 130 million upon the addition of Pohjola to the lender group. The maturity of the facility was also extended by a year to 30 June 2014. As at 31 December 2011, the outstanding loan amount was EUR 50 million, as compared to EUR 0 as at 31 December 2010.
Talvivaara has provided the following security in respect of the revolving credit facility and also to the investment and working capital loans from Finnvera plc ("Finnvera") (see "--Investment and Working Capital Loans from Finnvera" below): the floating charges in respect of Talvivaara Sotkamo in the aggregate amount of EUR 425 million, the mortgage deeds of the mortgage on Talvivaara Sotkamo's property in the aggregate amount of EUR 425 million and a pledge over the mining rights for Talvivaara Sotkamo's mining concession (mining register number 2819).
Investment and Working Capital Loans from Finnvera

The loan has a margin of 3.0 per cent. Of the total loan amount, EUR 45 million was drawn during the first half of 2009 and EUR 5 million was reserved for capitalisation of accrued interest. As at 31 December 2011, capitalisation of accrued interest amounted to EUR 5.0 million. No capitalisation of interest can be made after 31 December 2011. The loan agreement remains in force until all liabilities of Talvivaara Sotkamo towards Finnvera under the loan agreement and any intercreditor agreement are satisfied.
