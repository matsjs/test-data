participate in development work, playing a key role in the enhancement of the production process in particular. Talvivaara's research and development expenditure for the years ended 31 December 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to EUR 739,000, EUR 468,000 and EUR 731,000, respectively.
Investments
Talvivaara's capital expenditures amounted to EUR 79.1 million in 2011 and EUR 115.7 million in 2010.
In 2011, the capital expenditures related primarily to secondary heap foundations, secondary leaching equipment, and construction of a gypsum pond and the uranium extraction facility.
In 2010, the capital expenditures related primarily to the construction of heap foundations, installation of the second production line of the metals recovery plant and purchase of the secondary heap stacker and conveyors.
Talvivaara's principal investments that are in progress include construction of the secondary heap, gypsum pond and uranium recovery circuit. As at 30 December 2011, the Group had contractual commitments of EUR 14.5 million. These commitments relate to acquisition of new property, plant and mining equipment. For the year 2012, Talvivaara expects capital expenditure to be EUR 45-50 million, excluding the construction cost of the uranium extraction circuit, which will be covered by Cameco up to an amount of U.S.$ 60 million. A significant portion of the expected capital expenditure in 2012 relates to earthworks, specifically the construction of secondary heap foundations, the cost of which is difficult to estimate accurately in advance. Talvivaara will finance these investments from cash flow from operating activities and, if necessary, external debt.
The capital expenditures above were primarily incurred by the Guarantor.

Should any rights that may be registered arise as a result of Talvivaara's operations, Talvivaara will take all reasonable actions that are necessary to protect such rights.
