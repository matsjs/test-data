Adjustments to audited consolidatedfinancial statementsfo r the year ended 31 December 2010
In February 2010, Talvivaara concluded a long-term Zinc in Concentrate Streaming Agreement with Nyrstar. Under the terms of the agreement, Talvivaara shall deliver all of its zinc in concentrate production to Nyrstar until a total of 1,250,000 metric tonnes has been delivered. Talvivaara received an advance payment of USD 335 million from Nyrstar for the agreed deliveries. The advance payment was initially classified as a monetary liability and translated to euros on the basis of end-of-period exchange rates. Exchange rate gains and losses were recognised on the income statement as finance income or cost. Talvivaara has reclassified the advance payment as a non-monetary liability and restated the financial statements of prior periods according to IAS 8 in connection with its interim report for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2011. The reclassification better reflects the financial nature of the transaction, as the advance payment is repaid through physical deliveries and, therefore, there is no actual foreign exchange risk. The financial information presented below for the year ended 31 December 2010 is, therefore, unaudited.
