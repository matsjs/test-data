Credit risk
The investors of the Notes are exposed to a credit risk in respect of the Issuer and the Guarantor. The investor's possibility to receive payment under the Notes is thus dependent on the Issuer's and the Guarantor's ability to fulfil their payment obligations, which in turn is to a large extent dependent on developments in Talvivaara's business and financial performance.
