An "indicated mineral resource" is that part of a mineral resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical
exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. The locations are too widely or inappropriately spaced to
confirm geological and/or grade continuity but are spaced closely enough for continuity to be assumed.

An "inferred mineral resource" is that part of a mineral resource for which tonnage, grade and mineral content
can be estimated with a low level of confidence. It is inferred from geological evidence and assumed but not

verified geological and/or grade continuity. It is based on information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes which may be limited or of uncertain quality and reliability.
