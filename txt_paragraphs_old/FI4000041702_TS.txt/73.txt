5. Issue Price
6. Interest
The Notes bear interest at the rate of 9.75 per cent per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on 4 April and 4 October of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"). Interest shall accrue for each interest period from (and including) the first day of the interest period to (but excluding) the last day of such interest period on the principal amount of Notes outstanding from time to time. The first interest period commences on the Issue Date and ends on the first Interest Payment Date, 4 October 2012. Each consecutive interest period begins on the previous Interest Payment Date and ends on the following Interest Payment Date. The last interest period ends on the Redemption Date as defined below.
Interest in respect of the Notes will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the relevant Interest Period (calculated on the basis of a 365-day year or, in the case of a leap year, a 366-day year).
7. Payments
Interest on and principal of the Notes shall be paid in accordance with the Finnish legislation governing book-entry system and book-entry accounts as well as the regulations and decisions of Euroclear Finland.
Should the payment date of interest or principal fall on a date which is not a Business Day, the payment of the amount due will be postponed to the next following Business Day. The postponement of the payment date shall not affect the amount payable.
In these Terms and Conditions, "Business Day" shall mean a day on which banks in Helsinki are open for general business and on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System is open.
