Currently, Talvivaara's annual production target for nickel is 50,000 tonnes at full capacity. As by-products of the mine, it also expects to produce approximately 90,000 tonnes of zinc, 15,000 tonnes of copper and 1,800 tonnes of cobalt

annually. Talvivaara revised its nickel production target for 2011 to between 22,000 and 28,000 tonnes due to unplanned downtime of the metals recovery plant in the first quarter of 2011 and certain capacity-limiting bottlenecks identified at the plant. The nickel production target for 2011 was further lowered in the third quarter to a minimum of 16,000 tonnes due to problems with the hydrogen sulphide generators. Talvivaara's production target for 2012 is between 25,000 and 30,000 tonnes of nickel and between 50,000 and 60,000 tonnes of zinc. See "Risk Factors--Operational Ramp-up".
