Intellectual Property Rights
Talvivaara has filed one patent application relating to biological iron removal. Biological iron removal reduces the consumption of limestone used in solution purification. The application is pending.
Competition
Competition in the base metals mining industry is driven by supply-demand balances and metal prices, which in turn are affected by general economic cycles and shorter term market factors. At times when excess supply, lack of demand or various economic factors result in low metal prices, the mines with the highest production costs are at risk of losing profitability and may have to discontinue production. Due to its cost efficient production technology and favourable resource geometry, Talvivaara anticipates, once in full scale operation, being able to operate the Talvivaara mine profitably even during the lows of commodity price cycles. Impact of competition on Talvivaara is further mitigated by the fact that the Group has entered into long-term agreements whereby it has committed to sell and customers have committed to purchase the entire nickel, cobalt and zinc as well as the potential uranium production obtained from the Talvivaara mine.
Legal Proceedings
The Group has no pending governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any proceedings which are pending or threatened of which the Issuer or the Guarantor is aware) that may have, or may have had in the past 12 months, a significant effect on the financial position or profitability of the Issuer, the Guarantor and/or the Group, nor is the Issuer or the Guarantor aware of any such proceedings being threatened.
