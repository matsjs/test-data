increasing geological confidence, into inferred, indicated and measured categories.
A "measured mineral resource" is that part of a mineral resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical
characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a high level of confidence. It is based on
detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. The locations are spaced closely
enough to confirm geological and/or grade continuity.
