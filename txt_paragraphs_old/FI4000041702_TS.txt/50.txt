No voting rights
The holders of the Notes have no voting rights at the General Meetings of shareholders of the Issuer. Consequently, at the Issuer's General Meetings of shareholders, the holders of the Notes cannot influence any decisions by the Issuer to redeem the Notes or any decisions by the Issuer's shareholders concerning, among others, the capital structure of the Issuer.
Legislative amendments
The Notes are issued under Finnish law in force on the issue date. Any new statutes, ordinances and regulations, amendments to the legislation or changes in application of the law after the issue date may affect the Notes and the Issuer makes no representations in this regard.
Prescription
If any payment under the Notes has not been claimed within three years from the original due date thereof, the right to such payment will become void. Such prescription may cause final losses to holders of the Notes who have not claimed payment under the Notes within the prescription time of three years.
Modification
The terms and conditions contain provisions for calling Noteholders' Meetings to consider matters affecting the interests of holders of the Notes generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all holders of the Notes, including holders of the Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and holders of the Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.
