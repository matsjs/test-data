History o f Geological Work and Exploration
Geological work in the Talvivaara area commenced in the early 1900's when geological mapping of bedrock was conducted by the Geological Survey of Finland ("GSF") and continued through 1951. Between 1951 and 1962, various Finnish companies carried out exploration activities in the area. The result of this phase led GSF to commence detailed exploration in the area in 1977. As a result of the work done by GSF, two polymetallic deposits, Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi, were established. Outokumpu Mining acquired these deposits from the Finnish State in 1985 and the mining license covering the deposits was granted to Outokumpu Mining in 1986. Between 1989 and 1992, Outokumpu Mining focused on further geological work on the Talvivaara deposits.
