History
The Issuer and Talvivaara Sotkamo were incorporated in September 2003 for the purpose of acquiring and developing the two Talvivaara deposits, Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi. When Talvivaara Sotkamo acquired the exclusive rights to mine the Talvivaara deposits from Outokumpu Mining in February 2004, Talvivaara Sotkamo was also assigned the right to use all exploration data and research documentation relating to bioheapleaching without additional compensation. In return, Outokumpu Mining was granted an option to acquire a 20 per cent interest in Talvivaara Sotkamo. Outokumpu Mining exercised this option on 14 May 2007 and, as a result, Talvivaara Sotkamo has been an 80 per cent owned subsidiary of Talvivaara since that date. On 1 June 2011, Talvivaara entered into an agreement with Outokumpu Mining and its parent company, Outokumpu Oyj, to acquire an additional four per cent shareholding in Talvivaara Sotkamo. As a result of the acquisition, Talvivaara's ownership in Talvivaara Sotkamo increased from 80 per cent to 84 per cent and Outokumpu Mining's ownership decreased to 16 per cent. Simultaneously, Talvivaara entered into an exclusive option agreement with Outokumpu Mining Oy and Outokumpu Oyj whereby it had the right, at its sole discretion, in one or more instalments, to acquire Outokumpu Mining's remaining 16 per cent shareholding in Talvivaara Sotkamo for EUR 240 million at any time prior to 31 March 2012. Talvivaara did not exercise such option.

In June 2005, Talvivaara started the construction of an on-site pilot heap to test bioheapleaching and the initial bioheapleaching process commenced in August 2005. Pilot runs of metals recovery process were carried out from March to September 2006. In September 2005, Talvivaara submitted its EIA report as a precondition for applying for and obtaining an environmental permit. In March 2007, Talvivaara was issued an environmental permit and a starting order that allowed it to commence construction and other activities at the Talvivaara project area.
The construction of the Talvivaara mine commenced in April 2007 and continued throughout 2008, with focus in the first half of 2008 on preparations for mining, materials handling and bioheapleaching operations, and in the second half of 2008 on the completion of the metals recovery plant. In January 2008, the Talvivaara mine was connected to the Finnish national main grid by a 43 kilometre power line constructed from the Vuolijoki substation to the mine. In addition, construction of the 25 kilometre Talvivaara-Murtomäki railway, which began in February 2008, was completely commissioned and permitted in November 2009, before which limited production from the mine was transported by truck. The railway became part of the national railway network in September 2011. In 2009, Talvivaara focused on ramping up its production and generated its first sales revenues. Commercially significant production at the Talvivaara mine began in February 2009.
In 2010, Talvivaara continued to focus on ramping up production towards full-scale capacity, and produced 10,382 tonnes of nickel and 25,462 tonnes of zinc. Talvivaara also launched a project to study the possibility of expanding production beyond the current 50,000 tonnes of nickel per annum target, with scoping studies based on doubling production capacity to 100,000 tonnes of nickel and integrating further downstream to produce refined nickel metal. Talvivaara's production ramp-up continued in 2011, and Talvivaara produced 16,087 tonnes of nickel and 31,815 tonnes of zinc. During 2011, Talvivaara also commenced work to extract uranium in the form of uranium oxide as a by-product and continued to advance the project to expand production capacity beyond 50,000 tonnes of nickel per annum.
