History o f Geological Work and Exploration
Despite extensive exploration in the Talvivaara area that established the presence of large deposits, it was concluded at the time that exploitation of the relatively low-grade deposits would not be economically viable using conventional techniques. Therefore, the Talvivaara deposits remained unexploited until Talvivaara Sotkamo acquired the rights to the deposits and continued the geological work by focusing on sampling for metallurgical purposes and investigating sample areas for the pilot trial conducted in 2005 and 2006.
Geology
The two Talvivaara deposits are located in the southern part of the Kainuu belt, also known as the Kainuu schist zone. The belt is approximately 200 kilometres long with a maximum width of approximately 40 kilometres. The Talvivaara deposits comprise two different polymetallic ore bodies, Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi. The mineral resources in these ore bodies have been classified according to the JORC Code. The Competent Person as defined by the JORC Code was the former Chief Geologist of Talvivaara, Mr. Jukka Pitkäjärvi. The new Competent Person will be Mr. Hannu Lahtinen as of the spring of 2012. Talvivaara's total mineral resources, as defined by the JORC code, stand at 1,550 million tonnes, which contain 3.4 million tonnes of nickel and 7.6 million tonnes of zinc, corresponding to average metal grades of 0.22 per cent nickel and 0.49 per cent zinc. Both of the Talvivaara deposits are outcropping and relatively easy to mine.

Significant exploration potential remains between the Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi deposits and to the north of the Kolmisoppi deposit. Talvivaara expects to update its mineral resources statement in late 2012.
