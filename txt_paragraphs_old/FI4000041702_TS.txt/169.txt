Sale and Option Agreement and Agreement Amending the Original Sale and Option Agreement
On 27 February 2004, Talvivaara, Talvivaara Sotkamo and Outokumpu Mining entered into a sale and option agreement (as amended, the "Sale and Option Agreement") pursuant to which Outokumpu Mining sold the exclusive rights to mine the Talvivaara deposits to Talvivaara Sotkamo. Talvivaara Sotkamo was also assigned the rights to use all exploration data and research documentation relating to bioheapleaching without additional compensation. The amendment agreement dated 15 September 2006 partly amended the Sale and Option Agreement, which is detailed below.
The purchase price was EUR 1. In addition, Outokumpu Mining was granted an option to acquire shares in Talvivaara Sotkamo representing 20 per cent of the entire issued share capital in Talvivaara Sotkamo. This option was exercised by Outokumpu Mining on 14 May 2007. The mining license covering the Talvivaara deposits was assigned to Talvivaara Sotkamo in March 2004 and title to the mining concession was transferred to Talvivaara Sotkamo when Outokumpu Mining exercised its option to subscribe for the 20 per cent interest in Talvivaara Sotkamo.
