Mineral Resource Reporting
Mineral resources as defined by the JORC Code are based on mineral occurrences quantified on the basis of geological data and an assumed cut-off grade, and are divided into measured, indicated and inferred categories reflecting decreasing confidence in geological and/or grade continuity. No allowances are included for dilution and losses during mining, but the reporting of resource estimates carries the implication that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic exploitation. Resources may therefore be viewed as the estimation stage prior to the application of more stringent economic criteria for reserve definition, such as a rigorously defined cut-off grade and mine design outlines, along with allowances for dilution and losses during mining. Mineral resource categories are defined as follows:
·
A "mineral resource" is a concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic economic interest in or on the
Earth's crust in such form and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The
location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known, estimated or
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. Mineral resources are sub-divided, in order of
increasing geological confidence, into inferred, indicated and measured categories.
