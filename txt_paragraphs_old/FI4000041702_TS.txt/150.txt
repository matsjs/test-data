Three mineralogical ore types can be distinguished in the Kuusilampi and Kolmisoppi ore bodies: fine-grained dissemination, sulphide breccia and skarn ore. The average sulphide mineral content of the ore bodies is approximately 15 to 25 per cent. The main sulphides are pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and pentlandite. Pentlandite contains between 75 to 88 per cent of the nickel and pyrrhotite is the second most important mineral in terms of nickel content. Pyrite contains the majority (between 67 and 90 per cent) of the contained cobalt while chalcopyrite carries copper and sphalerite carries zinc.
The paleoproterozoic black schists in Finland typically also contain low concentrations of uranium. The black schist hosted ore at Talvivaara contains uranium in concentrations ranging from 0.0001 per cent to 0.04 per cent. Uranium occurs as thucholite, which is a mixture of hydrocarbons, uraninite and sulphides. In September 2009, GSF carried out gamma radiation measurements with a portable gamma spectrometer. Measured dose rates were between 0.04 and 0.21 pSv/h and the measurements did not show any abnormal gamma radiation values within the Talvivaara mine area. The Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety classifies dose rates between 0.05 and 0.30 pSv/h as typical background gamma radiation in Finland. The dose rates measured from the Talvivaara ore correspond to uranium concentrations of between 12.2 and 22.0 parts per million. Thorium equivalent grades were between 3.0 and 7.0 parts per million.
