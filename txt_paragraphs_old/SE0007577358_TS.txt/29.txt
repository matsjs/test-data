(e) any Group Company suspends its payments on any of its debts;
(f) any Group Company is declared bankrupt;
(g) any Material Group Company takes any corporate action or if other steps are taken or legal proceedings are started (other than proceedings which are being disputed in good faith by appropriate legal proceedings and are withdrawn or struck out or dismissed within thirty (30) calendar days) by any person for such Material Group Company's winding-up, dissolution, administration or re-organisation or for the appointment of a liquidator, provisional liquidator, receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, trustee or similar officer of it or of any or all of its revenues and assets or any execution or diligence is levied against all or a material (as determined by the Agent in its reasonable discretion) part of its revenues and assets; or
(h) a decision is made that any Material Group Company shall be merged and/or demerged into a company which is not a Group Company, unless the Agent has given its consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) in writing prior to the merger and/or demerger (where consent is not to be understood as a waiver of the rights that applicable law at the time assigns the concerned creditors). Such consent shall only be given if an accountant, engaged in accordance with Section 14.2 (e), has assured that the merger or demerger, as applicable, will not have a Material Adverse Effect.
13.2 If the Bonds are declared due and payable, the Company shall redeem the Bonds at a redemption amount equal to the Bonds' Nominal Amount plus the accrued interest, if any, pursuant to Section 5 from, but excluding, the

13.3 Termination for payment prematurely on the grounds mentioned in Sections 13.1 (b)-(d) above or, regarding any of the Companies Subsidiaries, on the grounds mentioned in Sections 13.1 (e)-(h) above may however only occur if the nature of the particular circumstance is such that it would have a Material Adverse Effect and that the cause of termination is continuing at the time of the Agent's declaration. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned in Section 13.1 (g) above.
