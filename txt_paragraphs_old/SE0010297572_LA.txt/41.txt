12.5 Calculation Adjustments
(a) The figures for EBITDA, Finance Charges and Net Finance Charges for the Reference Period shall be used for the Maintenance Test and the Incurrence Test, but adjusted so that:
(i) entities acquired or disposed of by the Group during the Reference Period, or after the end of the Reference Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be included or excluded (as applicable), pro forma, for the entire Reference Period; and
(ii) any entity or asset to be acquired with the proceeds from new Financial Indebtedness shall be included, pro forma, for the entire Reference Period.
(b) The figures for Senior Net Interest Bearing Debt set out in the financial statements as of the most recent quarter date (including when necessary, financial statements published before the First Issue Date), shall be used, but adjusted so that Senior Net Interest Bearing Debt for such period shall be:
(i) reduced to reflect any Senior Net Interest Bearing Debt attributable to a disposed entity or which has been repaid, repurchased or otherwise discharged as a result of or in connection with a disposal of an entity (to the extent such Senior Net Interest Bearing Debt is included in the relevant financial statements); and
(ii) increased on a pro forma basis by an amount equal to the Senior Net Interest Bearing Debt directly attributable to any Financial Indebtedness owed by acquired entities calculated as if all such debt had been incurred at the beginning of the relevant Reference Period; and
(iii) increased on a pro forma basis by an amount equal to the Senior Net Interest Bearing Debt directly attributable to any Financial Indebtedness incurred under any Subsequent Bonds, calculated as if such debt had been incurred at the beginning of the relevant Reference Period.
