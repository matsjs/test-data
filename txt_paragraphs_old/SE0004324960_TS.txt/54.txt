20 Taxation and Tax gross-up
The Company shall make all payments to be made by it without any Tax Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by law. If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by the Company, the amount of the payment due from the Company shall be increased to an amount which (after making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required. For the avoidance of doubt, the aforementioned obligations only apply if it is the Company that is obligated to make the Tax Deduction (i.e. not if, inter alia, the CSD is obligated to make a Tax Deduction).
If the Company is required to make a Tax Deduction, the Company shall make that Tax Deduction and any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law.
