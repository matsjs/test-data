14.3 Cross-Acceleration
Any Financial Indebtedness of a Material Group Company is not paid when due as extended by any originally applicable grace period, or is declared to be due and payable prior to its specified maturity as a result of an event of default (however described), provided that no Event of Default will occur under this Clause 14.3 if the aggregate amount of Financial Indebtedness that has fallen due is less than SEK 5,000,000 and provided that it does not apply to any Financial Indebtedness owed to a Group Company.
