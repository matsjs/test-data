(a) The incurrence test (the "Incurrence Test") is met if:
(i) The Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA is below:
(A) 3.00x from the First Issue Date until (and including) the date falling 18 months from the First Issue Date; and
(B) 2.50x from the date falling 18 months after the First Issue Date until (and including) the Final Redemption Date;
(ii) no Event of Default is continuing or would occur upon the incurrence.
(b) The calculation of the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no more than two months prior to the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness. The Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date so determined, but include the new Financial Indebtedness provided it is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt).
(c) If the Incurrence Test is tested in connection with the incurrence of Financial Indebtedness to be used for an acquisition, the calculation of the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA shall be made based on the Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA for the Group including the target company on a consolidated basis. The Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured for the Group including the target company on a consolidated basis on the relevant testing date so determined, and include the new Financial Indebtedness incurred by the Group for the acquisition.
