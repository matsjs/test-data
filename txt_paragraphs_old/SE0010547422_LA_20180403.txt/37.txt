(c) If the Incurrence Test is tested in connection with the incurrence of Financial Indebtedness to be used for an acquisition, the calculation of the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA shall be made based on the Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA for the Group including the target company on a consolidated basis. The Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured for the Group including the target company on a consolidated basis on the relevant testing date so determined, and include the new Financial Indebtedness incurred by the Group for the acquisition.
The figures for EBITDA for the Reference Period ending on the relevant test date shall be used for the Incurrence Test and the Maintenance Test, but adjusted so that:
(a) entities acquired (including the Target Companies) or disposed of by the Group during the Reference Period, or after the end of the Reference Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be included or excluded (as applicable), pro forma, for the entire Reference Period; and
(b) any entity to be acquired with the proceeds from new Financial Indebtedness shall be included, pro forma, for the entire Reference Period.
