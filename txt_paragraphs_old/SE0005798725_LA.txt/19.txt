THE AMOUNT OF THE BONDS AND UNDERTAKING TO MAKE PAYMENTS
2.1 The aggregate amount of the Bond loan and the maximum total nominal amount will amount up to SEK 500,000,000, including Subsequent Bonds, and will be represented by Bonds, each of a nominal amount of SEK 1,000,000 or full multiples thereof (the "Nominal Amount"). All Bonds issued in the Bond Issue are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 100.00 % of the Nominal Amount. The ISIN for the Bonds is SE0005798725. The minimum permissible investment in connection with the Bond Issue is SEK 1,000,000.
2.2 The Issuer may choose not to issue the full amount of Bonds on the Issue Date and may in such case, provided that the Incurrence Test is met, and provided that no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue, choose to issue the remaining amount of Bonds at one or more subsequent dates ("Subsequent Bond Issue"). The price of Bonds issued in a Subsequent Bond Issue may be set at the Nominal Amount or at a higher or lower amount than the Nominal Amount. Bonds issued in a Subsequent Bond Issue shall be issued subject to the Terms and Conditions and, for the avoidance of doubt, have the same ISIN, Interest Rate, Nominal Amount, final maturity and other rights as Bonds issued on the Issue Date.
2.3 The Issuer undertakes to repay the Bonds, to pay Interest and to otherwise act in accordance and comply with these Terms and Conditions.
