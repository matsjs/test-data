(D) 4.00:1 from and including the date falling thirty-six (36) months after the Issue Date and at any time thereafter to the Maturity Date; and
(b) The calculation of the Leverage Ratio shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no earlier than one (1) month prior to the event relevant for the application of the Incurrence Test.
(c) The Leverage Ratio shall be measured on the relevant testing date, however so that: (i) the full commitment of any new Financial Indebtedness in respect of which the Incurrence Test shall be made (after deducting any Financial Indebtedness which shall be refinanced at the time of incurrence of such new Financial Indebtedness) shall be added to the amount of the Net Interest Bearing Debt and (ii) any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of any such new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt.

(d) The figures for the EBITDA in respect of any Relevant Period ending on the last day of the period covered by the most recent Financial Report shall be used for the Incurrence Test, but adjusted so that:
(i) entities, assets or operations acquired or disposed of by the Group during that Relevant Period, or after the end of that Relevant Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be included or excluded (as applicable) pro forma for the entire Relevant Period;
(ii) any entity, asset or operation to be acquired with the proceeds from any new Permitted Financial Indebtedness shall be included pro forma for the entire Relevant Period; and
(iii) the full run rate effect of all cost savings and cost synergies reasonably projected by the Issuer as being obtainable during the twelve (12) months period following the date of the completion of such acquisition shall be taken into account, provided that the aggregate amount of such cost savings and cost synergies may (for such purposes) not exceed 10 per cent. of the EBITDA for the Relevant Period.
(e) The Issuer shall, in connection with any transaction in respect of which the Incurrence Test is to be made, provide to the Bond Trustee a Compliance Certificate containing calculations (showing in reasonable detail) the calculation of the Leverage Ratio, including the Net Interest Bearing Debt and the EBITDA used for the purpose of that Incurrence Test. The Bond Trustee may share such Compliance Certificate with the Bondholders.
