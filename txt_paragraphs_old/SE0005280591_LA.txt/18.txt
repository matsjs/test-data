7.3
Payments of principal and interest
Payment of the Nominal Amount and interest will be made to the person who is a Noteholder on the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the respective payment date or, if on the relevant time another Business Day which is falling closer to the relevant Redemption Date is generally applied in the Swedish Note market, such other Business Day ("Record Date"). If a Noteholder has registered, through an Account Operator, that payments of principal amounts and interest shall be deposited in a certain bank account, such deposits will be effected by the CSD on the relevant payment date. In other cases, payments will be transferred by the CSD to the Noteholder at the address registered with the CSD on the Record Date. If a day on which an amount becomes due and payable is not a Business Day the amount will be deposited or transferred in accordance with the applicable Business Day Convention. Should the CSD, due to a delay on behalf of the Issuer or some other obstacle, not be able to effect the payment of amounts according to the aforesaid, the CSD will pay such amount to the Noteholders on the Record Date as soon as possible after such obstacle has been removed. If a person to whom payment has been made in accordance with the above was not entitled to receive such payment, the Issuer and the CSD shall nevertheless be deemed to have fulfilled their obligations, provided that the Issuer and/or the CSD did not have knowledge of that such payment was made to a person not entitled to receive such amount and provided the Issuer and/or the CSD acted with normal care.
