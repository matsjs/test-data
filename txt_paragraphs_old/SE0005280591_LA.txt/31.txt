Hoist International AB, being the sole shareholder in the Issuer, undertakes to in the event of a conversion of the Notes as set out in Condition 11, to the extent permitted by law and the Regulations and sufficient to cure the Non-Viability Event, vote for and otherwise use any reasonable endeavours to procure that each of the Noteholders as substitution for its Notes receives equity instruments in the Issuer as set out in this undertaking.
(i)
preferential shares with a non-cumulative coupon of 15% p. a.; or
(ii)
if (i) above is not sufficient and/or permitted, ordinary shares issued at a conversion rate no
less favourable to the Noteholders than the conversion rate applicable under the Existing
Capital Base Instruments.
In each case the shares may at the option of Hoist International AB carry limited voting rights and be redeemable (if sufficient and permitted).
This undertaking is for the avoidance of doubt not an undertaking for Hoist International AB to provide new equity or loans to the Issuer, nor shall it in any way be interpreted as a guarantee in respect of any obligations of the Issuer under these Terms and Conditions.
