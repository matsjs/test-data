20.3 Should a Force Majeure Event arise which prevents the Agent or the Issuing Agent from taking any action required to comply with these Terms and Conditions, such action may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed.
20.4 The provisions in this Condition 20 apply unless they are inconsistent with the provisions of the Swedish Financial Instruments Accounts Act (1998:1479) which provisions shall take precedence.
