13.3 13.4
The Agent may not accelerate the Bonds in accordance with Clause 13.1 by reference to a specific Event of Default if it is no longer continuing or if it has been decided on a Bondholders Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure, to waive such Event of Default (temporarily or permanently).
The Agent shall notify the Bondholders of an Event of Default within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the Agent received actual knowledge of that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. The Agent shall, within twenty (20) Business Days of the date on which the Agent received actual knowledge of that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, decide if the Bonds shall be so accelerated. If the Agent decides not to accelerate the Bonds, the Agent shall promptly seek instructions from the Bondholders in accordance with Clause 15 (Decisions by Bondholders). The Agent shall always be entitled to take the time necessary to consider whether an occurred event constitutes an Event of Default.
If the Bondholders instruct the Agent to accelerate the Bonds, the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds due and payable and take such actions as may, in the opinion of the Agent, be necessary or desirable to enforce the rights of the Bondholders under the Finance Documents, unless the relevant Event of Default is no longer continuing.
If the right to accelerate the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law, an arbitral tribunal or a government authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the period of appeal has expired in order for cause of acceleration to be deemed to exist.
In the event of an acceleration of the Bonds in accordance with this Clause 13, the Issuer shall redeem all Bonds at an amount per Bond equal to 100 per cent, of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
