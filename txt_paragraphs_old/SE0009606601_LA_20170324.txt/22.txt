If payment or repayment is made in accordance with this Clause 7, the Issuer and the CSD shall be deemed to have fulfilled their obligation to pay, irrespective of whether such payment was made to a person not entitled to receive such amount, unless the Issuer or the CSD (as applicable) was aware of that the payment was being made to a person not entitled to receive such amount.
INTEREST
Each Initial Bond carries Interest at the Interest Rate calculated on the Nominal Amount from (but excluding) the First Issue Date up to (and including) the relevant Redemption Date. Any Subsequent Bond will carry Interest at the Interest Rate calculated on the Nominal Amount from (but excluding) the Interest Payment Date falling immediately prior to its issuance up to (and including) the relevant Redemption Date. For the avoidance of doubt, interest under these Terms and Conditions shall never be calculated as being an amount less than zero (0).
Interest accrues during an Interest Period. Payment of Interest in respect of the Bonds shall be made to the Bondholders on each Interest Payment Date for the preceding Interest Period.
