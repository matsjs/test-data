(m) the board of directors of a Group Company (other than the Issuer) establishes a merger plan under which the Group Company shall merge into a new or existing company (other than a Group Company), with the effect that the Group Company is not the surviving entity, provided that a consent from the Bondholders' Meeting to do so is not obtained and provided that the merger will entail a Material Adverse Effect.
In the event that IFRS changes, and no longer recognizes or requires fair value
adjustments in the calculation of the book value of properties, the equity and total assets
shall (for the calculation of Equity Ratio above) nevertheless be adjusted with reference
to such market values as if IFRS, as applied on the First Issue Date, would remain
applicable.
