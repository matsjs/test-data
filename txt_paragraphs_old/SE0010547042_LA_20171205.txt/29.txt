5.3
Upon a transfer of Bonds, any rights and obligations under the Finance Documents relating
to such Bonds are automatically transferred to the transferee.
5.4 No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden, where action for that purpose is required. Each Bondholder must inform itself about, and observe, any applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds, (due to, e.g., its nationality, its residency, its registered address or its place(s) of business). Each Bondholder must ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.
5.5
The Bonds have not been registered under the Securities Act and the Issuer is under no
obligation to arrange for registration of the Bonds under the Securities Act or under any
other law or regulation.
