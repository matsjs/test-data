25.3 Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of Clause 25.1 shall not in any way limit an individual Noteholder's right to claim and enforce payments which are due to it under Clause 11.6 (Mandatory repurchase due to a Change of Control Event or a Listing Failure Event) or other payments which are due by the Issuer to some but not all Noteholders.
26.1 The right to receive repayment of the principal of the Notes shall be time-barred and become void ten (10) years from the Redemption Date. The right to receive payment of interest (excluding any capitalised interest) shall be time-barred and become void three (3) years from the relevant due date for payment. The Issuer is entitled to any funds set aside for payments in respect of which the Noteholders' right to receive payment has been time-barred and has become void.
26.2 If a limitation period is duly interrupted in accordance with the Swedish Act on Limitations (preskriptionslag (1981:130)), a new limitation period of ten (10) years with respect to the right to receive repayment of the principal of the Notes, and of three (3) years with respect to receive payment of interest (excluding capitalised interest) will commence, in both cases calculated from the date of interruption of the limitation period, as such date is determined pursuant to the provisions of the Swedish Act on Limitations.
