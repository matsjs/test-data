Schedule 3 Agreed Security Principles
(a) The Super Senior Creditors and the Noteholders shall be granted security over same assets and guarantees from the same entities, but the rights of the Noteholders shall always rank after and be subordinated to the rights of the Super Senior Creditors in accordance with the principles set out in the Intercreditor Agreement. General statutory limitations (e.g. financial assistance, corporate benefit, "thin capitalization" rules and retention of title claims) may limit the ability of a Group Company to provide security or require that such security is limited by an amount or otherwise, provided that the relevant Group Company must use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle.
(b) The Transaction Security and extent of its perfection and scope shall take into account the cost, work and time of providing security which must be reasonably proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties.
