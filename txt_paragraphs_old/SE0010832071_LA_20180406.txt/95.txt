(a) The Super Senior Creditors and the Noteholders shall be granted security over same assets and guarantees from the same entities, but the rights of the Noteholders shall always rank after and be subordinated to the rights of the Super Senior Creditors in accordance with the principles set out in the Intercreditor Agreement. General statutory limitations (e.g. financial assistance, corporate benefit, "thin capitalization" rules and retention of title claims) may limit the ability of a Group Company to provide security or require that such security is limited by an amount or otherwise, provided that the relevant Group Company must use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle.
(c)
Group Companies will not be required to give guarantees or enter into Transaction Security
Documents if it would conflict with the fiduciary duties of their directors or contravene any legal
prohibition or result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer
provided that the relevant Group Company must use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such
obstacle.
(d) Any assets subject to pre-existing third party arrangements which are permitted by the Finance Documents or any other contractual restrictions on assignments and which prevent those assets from being charged, will be excluded from any relevant Transaction Security Document but the Group Company must use reasonable endeavours to obtain consent to charging any such assets if the relevant asset is material.
(e) The Transaction Security Documents shall operate to create security rather than to impose any new commercial obligations and shall, accordingly, not contain additional or duplicate representations or undertakings to those contained in these Terms and Conditions or in the Super Senior RCF unless required for the creation, perfection or preservation of the security and shall not be unduly burdensome on the Group Company or interfere unreasonably with the operation of its business.
