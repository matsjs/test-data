(m) Security granted under Spanish law shall be given in favour of all Secured Parties individually.
(n) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Finance Documents, if the Security Agent is not satisfied that it does not need to be resident, incorporated (including by way of a branch office), registered or authorised in any jurisdiction or deposit any funds in any jurisdiction where the Security Agent, at the time the relevant Transaction Security shall be granted, is not resident, incorporated (including by way of a branch office), registered or authorised in, the Security Agent shall have a right to (without consent from any Secured Party) waive the requirement in any Senior Finance Document to grant that Transaction Security. Satisfaction in this respect should either be through the inclusion of such statement in a legal opinion or by any other legal statement from a well reputable law firm which in form and substance is acceptable to the Security Agent (acting reasonably).
