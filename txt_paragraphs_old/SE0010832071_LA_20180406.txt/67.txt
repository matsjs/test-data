18 Decisions by Noteholders
18.1 A request by the Agent for a decision by the Noteholders on a matter relating to the Finance Documents shall (at the option of the Agent) be dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure.
18.2 Any request from the Issuer or a Noteholder (or Noteholders) representing at least ten (10) per cent, of the Adjusted Nominal Amount (such request may only be validly made by a person who is a Noteholder on the Business Day immediately following the day on which the request is received by the Agent and shall, if made by several Noteholders, be made by them jointly) for a decision by the Noteholders on a matter relating to the Finance Documents

shall be directed to the Agent and dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting or by way a Written Procedure, as determined by the Agent. The person requesting the decision may suggest the form for decision making, but if it is in the Agent's opinion more appropriate that a matter is dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting than by way of a Written Procedure, it shall be dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting.
18.3 The Agent may refrain from convening a Noteholders' Meeting or instigating a Written Procedure if (i) the suggested decision must be approved by any person in addition to the Noteholders and such person has informed the Agent that an approval will not be given, or (ii) the suggested decision is not in accordance with applicable laws or regulations.
18.4 Should the Agent not convene a Noteholders' Meeting or instigate a Written Procedure in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, without Clause 18.3 being applicable, the Issuer or the Noteholder(s) requesting a decision by the Noteholders may convene such Noteholders' Meeting or instigate such Written Procedure, as the case may be, instead. The Issuer or the Issuing Agent shall upon request provide the convening Noteholder(s) with the information available in the debt register (skuldbok) kept by the CSD in respect of the Notes in order to convene and hold the Noteholders' Meeting or instigate and carry out the Written Procedure, as the case may be.
