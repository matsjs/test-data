"Interest Period" means (i) in respect of the first Interest Period, the period from (but excluding) the First Issue Date to (and including) the first Interest Payment Date, and (ii) in respect of subsequent Interest Periods, the period from (but excluding) an Interest Payment Date to (and including) the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (or a shorter period if relevant).
"Issue Date" means the First Issue Date and any subsequent date when a Subsequent Bond is issued.
"Issuer" means Velcora Holding AB, a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Sweden with corporate identity number 556987-4463.

"Make Whole Amount" means a price equivalent to the sum of:
(a) the present value on the relevant record date of 104.00 per cent, of the Outstanding Nominal Amount as if such payment originally should have taken place on the First Call Date; and
(b) the present value on the relevant record date of the remaining Interest Payments (assuming that the Interest Rate for the period from the relevant redemption date to the First Call Date will be equal to the interpolated SEK mid-swap rate for the remaining term from the redemption date until the First Call Date plus the Floating Rate Margin), less any accrued but unpaid interest, through and including the First Call Date,
each calculated by using a discount rate of 50 basis points over the comparable Swedish government bond rate (i.e. the rate for a comparable period from the relevant redemption date to the First Call Date) and where "relevant record date" shall mean a date agreed upon between the Trustee, the CSD and the Issuer in connection with such repayment.
"Market Loan" means any loan or other indebtedness where an entity issues commercial paper, certificates, subordinated debentures, bonds or any other debt securities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, medium term note programmes and other market funding programmes), provided in each case that such instruments and securities are or can be subject to trade on Nasdaq Stockholm or any other regulated or unregulated recognised market place.
