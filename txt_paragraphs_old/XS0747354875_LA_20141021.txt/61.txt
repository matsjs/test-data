Additional Guarantees
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Series A Senior Loan, any Credit Facility or any other Public Debt o f the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee is incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiaiy shall not be obligated to become such a guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee is contrary to agreed security principles and could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiaiy (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out o f pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary.
Future Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under "--Releases of the Guarantees". A Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option o f the Issuer if at the date of such release either (i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor, or (ii) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessaiy actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.
The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability o f the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests".
