If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer's Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

(1) the payment of principal,
(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes,
(3) interest, or
(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee,
such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
