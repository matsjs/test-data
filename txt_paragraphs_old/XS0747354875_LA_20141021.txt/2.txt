 be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see "Book-Entry, Delivery and Form").
The Guarantees The Notes will be guaranteed, as of the Issue Date, by the Initial Guarantors. Any additional subsidiary of the Issuer that becomes a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility shall, subject to agreed security principles and to the extent legally possible, become a party to the Indenture and will Guarantee the Notes on a senior basis. Each entity that Guarantees the Notes subsequent to the Issue Date is referred to herein as a "Post-Completion Guarantor" and such entities are collectively referred to as the "Post-Completion Guarantors"; the Post-Completion Guarantors together with the Initial Guarantors are collectively referred to herein as the "Guarantors" and each is referred to as a "Guarantor".
Each Guarantee o f the Notes will, at the time a Guarantor grants such Guarantee:  be a general senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor, secured as set forth under "-- Security";  rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated to such Guarantor's Guarantee (including the senior guarantee given in favor of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Series A Senior Loan and certain Hedging Obligations, provided the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility will be entitled to priority of payment from the proceeds of any enforcement of such Guarantee and the holders of the Series A Notes and indebtedness under the Series A Senior Loan will be entitled to priority of payment over the holders o f the Series B Notes from any such proceeds);
 rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future obligation o f that Guarantor that is expressly subordinated to the Notes (including the Guarantor's guarantee o f the Mezzanine Loan); and

 be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness o f that Guarantor that is secured with property or assets that do not secure that Guarantor's Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such Indebtedness.
The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes-- Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability". The validity and enforceability o f the Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability o f the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests".
Each of the Issuer and the Initial Guarantors shall, subject to agreed security principles, take such necessary actions, and the Issuer shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to take such necessary actions, so that as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event no later than the date on which the relevant Post-Completion Guarantor grants a guarantee in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, each Post-Completion Guarantor shall become a Guarantor o f the Notes by executing and delivering to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture.
