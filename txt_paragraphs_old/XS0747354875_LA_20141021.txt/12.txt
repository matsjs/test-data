Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors shall take such necessary actions, and the Issuer shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to take such necessary actions, so that the Liens on the Collateral shall, subject to legal representations, agreed security principles and certain limitations, be fully effective with respect to the Issue Date Collateral, on or about the Issue Date. In certain situations, a Post-Completion Guarantor might not be able to provide a Guarantee or grant the Post-Completion Collateral to the Security Agent for the benefit o f the Holders. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes-- Certain Notes Guarantors will not initially guarantee the Notes and certain Collateral will not initially secure the Notes." Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under "--Impairment of Security Interest" and "--Liens", the Issuer is permitted to pledge the Collateral in connection with future issuances o f its Indebtedness, including any Additional Notes, or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, permitted under the Indenture and on terms consistent with the relative priority of such Indebtedness.
Priority
The relative priority among (a) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the lenders under the Series A Senior Loan, (c) the counterparties under certain hedging obligations secured on the Collateral, (d) the lenders under the Mezzanine Loan Agreement and (e) the Trustee and the Holders of the Series A Notes and the Series B Notes with respect to the security interest in the Collateral that is created by the Security Documents and secures obligations under the Notes or the Guarantees and the Indenture (the "Security Interest") is established by the terms o f the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture, the Security Documents and the security documents relating to the Revolving Credit Facility, the Series A Senior Loan, such hedging obligations and the Mezzanine Loan Agreement, which provide, among other things, that:
(1) the obligations under the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Series A Senior Loan and certain hedging obligations are secured equally and ratably by a first-priority interest in the Collateral, provided that any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received from any enforcement of the security over any Collateral; and
(2) the obligations under the Mezzanine Loan Agreement will be secured by a second-priority interest in the Collateral (subject to certain exceptions).
The Priority Agreement will provide that any Series B Indebtedness (including the Series B Notes) shall rank below any Series A Indebtedness (including the Series A Notes and the Series A Senior Loan) in right of priority and payment. All amounts received by the Trustee from the realization or enforcement of all or any part o f the Collateral or the Notes Guarantees will be first applied towards the discharge o f any amounts owed under the Indenture to Holders of the Series A Notes and under the Series A Senior Loan, then applied towards the discharge of any such amounts owed to holders of any Series B Indebtedness (including the Series B Notes).
See "Description of Certain Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement", "Description of Certain Indebtedness-- Series A Senior Loan Agreement", "Description of Certain Indebtedness--Priority Agreement", "Description of Certain Indebtedness--Mezzanine Loan Agreement" and "--Right of Payment". In addition, in connection with the incurrence of certain Indebtedness that is permitted by the Indenture to be secured on the Collateral, the Issuer will enter into Additional Intercreditor Agreements in compliance with the Indenture on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement. See "-- Certain Covenants-- Impairment of Security Interest" and "--Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound".
