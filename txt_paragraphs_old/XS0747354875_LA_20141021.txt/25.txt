Selection and Notice If less than all of the Notes is to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the Registrar will select Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, and in compliance with the requirements o f Euroclear or Clearstream, or if the Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribes no method o f selection, on apro rata basis or by use of a pool factor; provided, however, that no Note of 100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of 1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion o f the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms o f the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the
153
date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.
Redemption for Taxation Reasons
The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% o f the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a "Tax Redemption Date") (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under "Withholding Taxes"), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otheiwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:
(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or
(2) any change in position regarding the official application, administration or written interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a "Change in Tax Law"),
the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) with respect to any Guarantee, as the case may be, is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay more than de minimis Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer or such Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable or, where such payment method would be reasonable under the circumstances, payment through another Guarantor or the Issuer). Such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the Issue Date. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under "Selection and Notice". Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice o f redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor (as defined below) would be obliged to make such payment o f Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer's Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be, has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept such Officer's Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence o f the satisfaction o f the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.
