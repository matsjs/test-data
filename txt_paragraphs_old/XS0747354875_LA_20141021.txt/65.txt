If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events o f Default (except with respect to nonpayment o f principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Subject to the provisions o f the Indenture relating to the duties o f the Trustee, if an Event o f Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any o f the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:
(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount o f the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
