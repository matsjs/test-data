Amounts") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holders or the Trustee, as the case may be, after such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:
(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason o f the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner o f the Note to comply with a written request o f the Payor addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding such be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice o f the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;
(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by withholding from a payment o f the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes;
(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(5) any Taxes that are required to be deducted or withheld on a payment to an individual pursuant to the Directive or any law implementing, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive;
(6) except in the case of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up o f the Payor, any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another paying agent in a member state o f the European Union; or
(7) any combination of the above.
Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary o f the payment had presented the Note for payment (where presentation is required) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason o f any of clauses (1) to (7) inclusive above.
The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies o f tax receipts evidencing the payment o f any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices o f the Paying Agent. The Payor will attach to each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such withholding Taxes paid per 1,000 principal amount of the Notes.
