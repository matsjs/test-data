The provisions set forth in this "Merger and Consolidation" covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations o f the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading "--Issuer" shall apply to such transaction; and (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose o f changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form o f such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading "--The Issuer" or "--The Guarantors", as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction.
There is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person.
Suspension o f Covenants on Achievement o f Investment Grade Status
If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a "Suspension Event"), then, beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the "Reversion Date"), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes: "--Limitation on Restricted Payments", "--Limitation on Indebtedness", "--Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries", "Certain Covenants--Limitation on Affiliate Transactions", "-- Limitation on Sales o f Assets and Subsidiary Stock", the provisions o f clause (3) o f the first paragraph o f the covenant described under "--Merger and Consolidation" and "--Impairment of Security Interest" and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The "Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance o f the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "-- Limitation on Indebtedness". In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status.
Impairment o fSecurity Interest
The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence o f Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit o f the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any o f the Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; provided, however, that in the case o f clause (i) above, except with respect to any discharge or release in accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or any action
178
expressly permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency o f the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board o f Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.
