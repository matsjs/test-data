(5) certain events o f bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or group o f Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as o f the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the "bankruptcy provisions");
(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms o f the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture and except through the gross negligence or willful misconduct o f the Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of 10.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such
181
security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days; and
(8) any Guarantee of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiaiy ceases to be in lull force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms o f such Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days.
However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders o f 25% in principal amount o f the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.
If an Event o f Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders o f at least 25% in principal amount o f the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration o f the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under "Events of Default" has occurred and is continuing, the declaration o f acceleration o f the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration o f acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration o f the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree o f a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events o f Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because o f the acceleration o f the Notes, have been cured or waived.
If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.
Holders o f the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
