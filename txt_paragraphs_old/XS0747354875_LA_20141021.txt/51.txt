provided, however, if the assets disposed of constitute Collateral or constitute all or substantially all o f the assets o f a Restricted Subsidiary whose Capital Stock has been pledged as Collateral, subject to certain agreed security principles, the Issuer shall pledge or shall cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to pledge any acquired Capital Stock or assets (to the extent such assets were of a categoiy of assets included in the Collateral as of the Issue Date) referred to in this covenant in favor o f the Notes on a first-ranking basis.
On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds 30.0 million, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer ("Asset Disposition Offer") to all Holders (first to holders of the Series A Notes, then, provided any Excess Proceeds remain, to Holders o f the Series B Notes) and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness (first to holders of Series A Indebtedness, then, provided any Excess Proceeds remain, to holders of Series B Indebtedness), to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out o f the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect o f the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price o f no more than) 100% o f the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount o f Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of 100,000 and in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof.
To the extent that the aggregate amount o f Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount o f the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount o f Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period o f not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the "Asset Disposition Offer Period"). No later than five Business Days after the termination o f the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the "Asset Disposition Purchase Date"), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the "Asset Disposition Offer Amount") or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.
On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations o f 100,000 and in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination o f the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer's Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entiy) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion o f the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination o f 100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.
The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements o f Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.
