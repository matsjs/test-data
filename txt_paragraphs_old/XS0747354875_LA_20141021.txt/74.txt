addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders o f the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf o f the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream. Such notices may also be published on the website o f the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions
The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under or in connection with the Notes and the relevant Guarantees, as the case may be, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent o f the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date o f that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).
If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes o f this currency indemnify provision, it will be primafacie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder o f a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactoiy to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer's and the Guarantor's other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver o f the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect o f any sum due under any Note, any Guarantee or to the Trustee.
Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for puiposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.
Enforceability of Judgments Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment o f principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.
