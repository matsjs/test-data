· accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;
· be payable to the holder of record o f such Series A Floating Rate Notes on the February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and
· be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.
Set forth below is a summary of certain o f the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Series A Floating Rate Notes.
"Determination Date" with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period.
"EURIBOR" with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Telerate Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date. If Telerate Page 248 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank's offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each o f three major banks in London, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank's rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.
"euro-zone" means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.
"Interest Period" means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include June 1, 2012.
"Representative Amount" means the greater of (i) 1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.
