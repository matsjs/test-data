(2) any change in position regarding the official application, administration or written interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a "Change in Tax Law"),
Withholding Taxes
All payments made by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors or a successor of the Issuer or Guarantor (a "Payor") on the Notes or any Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the official interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:
(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Guarantee is made, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or
(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a "Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction"),
will at any time be required from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor of the Paying Agent with respect to any Note or Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the "Additional
154
Amounts") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holders or the Trustee, as the case may be, after such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:
(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note or the Indenture or any Guarantee in respect thereof;
