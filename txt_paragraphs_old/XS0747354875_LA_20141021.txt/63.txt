Each of the following is an "Event o f Default" under the Indenture:
(2) default in the payment o f the principal amount o f or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;
(3) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount o f the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;
(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any o f its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment o f which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:
(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the expiration o f the grace period provided in such Indebtedness ("payment default"); or
(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "cross acceleration provision"),
and, in each case, either (i) the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity o f which has been so accelerated, aggregates 25.0 million or more or (ii) such Indebtedness is incurred pursuant to clause (1) o f the second paragraph o f the "--Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant secured by Collateral that is granted the benefit of super senior priority rights on the proceeds of enforcement of Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, and (A) the initial 30 day consultation period under the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the enforcement of such Indebtedness has expired, (B) certain insolvency events have occurred or (C) the consultation period under the Intercreditor Agreement does not apply because the Majority Super Senior Creditors have determined in good faith that to enter into consultation could reasonably be expected to reduce the amount likely to be realized upon enforcement such that the obligations owed to them would not be discharged in full and have instructed the securing agent as to the enforcement o f the Collateral;
(5) certain events o f bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or group o f Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as o f the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the "bankruptcy provisions");
(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of 25.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period o f 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the "judgment default provision");
