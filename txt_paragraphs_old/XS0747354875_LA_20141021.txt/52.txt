The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements o f Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture.

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time o f such transaction or the execution o f the agreement providing for such transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;
(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of15.0 million, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority o f the members of the Board o f Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above; and
(3) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate consideration in excess of 30.0 million, the Issuer has received a written opinion (a "Fairness Opinion") from an Independent Financial Advisor that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or that the terms are not materially less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's-length basis from a Person that is not an Affiliate.
