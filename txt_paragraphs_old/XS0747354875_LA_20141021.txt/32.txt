The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements o f Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change o f Control provisions o f the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.
The definition o f "Change of Control" includes a disposition o f all or substantially all o f the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all", there is no precise established definition o f the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of "all or substantially all" o f the property or assets o f a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. In addition, you should note that recent case law suggests that, in the event that incumbent directors are replaced as a result of a contested election, issuers may nevertheless avoid triggering a change of control under clauses similar to clause (2) of the definition of "Change of Control" if the outgoing directors were to approve the new directors for the puiposes o f that clause.
The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result o f a Change o f Control may be waived or modified with the written consent o f Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.
Certain Covenants
Limitation on Indebtedness
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any of the Guarantors may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is less than (x) 6.75 to 1.0, if the date o f such Incurrence is prior to the one year anniversary o f the Completion Date, or (y) 6.0 to 1.0, if the date of such Incurrence is on or after the one year anniversary o f the Completion Date.
The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:
(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters o f credit or bankers' acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) 300.0 million, plus (ii) in the case o f any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof,
