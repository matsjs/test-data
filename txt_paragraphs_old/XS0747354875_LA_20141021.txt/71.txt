The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment o f the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under "Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation"), (3), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under "Events of Default" above.
In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the "defeasance trust") with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this puipose) cash in euros or eurodenominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:
(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax puiposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling o f the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);
(2) an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;
(3) an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;
(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and
(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.
