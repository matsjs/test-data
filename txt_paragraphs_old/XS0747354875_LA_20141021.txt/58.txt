The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.
There is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve "all or substantially all" o f the property or assets of a Person.
The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this "Merger and Consolidation" covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the Issuer has complied with the covenant described under "--Limitation on Sales o f Assets and Subsidiary Stock" or (ii) the creation o f a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary o f the Issuer.
The Guarantors
None of the Guarantors (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms o f the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement) may:
(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation),
(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person, or
(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it
