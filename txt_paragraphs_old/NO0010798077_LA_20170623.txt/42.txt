The relevant Fixed Rate or PIK Rate interest payable amount shall be calculated based on a
applicable Interest Payment Date (or, in the case of interest accrued to the first Interest
Payment Date, since the Issue Date).
9.6
For the avoidance of doubt, the issue of additional Bonds in payment of interest accrued at
the PIK Rate shall be taken into account for the purposes of calculating both the amount of
Outstanding Bonds and the amount of interest accrued at the Fixed Rate and PIK Rate that is
payable on the Outstanding Bonds on each remaining Interest Payment Date.
