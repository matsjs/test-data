11.2 Release of Transaction Security
The Security Agent may at any time, acting on instructions of the Secured Creditors, release any Transaction Security in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any Transaction Security will always be released pro rata between the Secured Creditors and the remaining Transaction Security will continue to rank pari passu between the Secured Creditors as set forth in the Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement.
