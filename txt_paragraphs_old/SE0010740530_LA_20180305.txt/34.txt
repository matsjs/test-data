11.4 Testing of the Incurrence Test
The calculation of the Interest Coverage Ratio shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no more than two months prior to the incurrence of Financial Indebtedness under item (j) of the definition of Permitted Debt, or the making of a Restricted Payment (as applicable). The Net Finance Charges shall be measured on the relevant testing date so determined, but include the new Financial Indebtedness provided it is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Finance Charges). EBITDA shall be calculated as set out in Clause 11.5 (Adjustments) and based on the figures set out in the most recent Financial Report.
