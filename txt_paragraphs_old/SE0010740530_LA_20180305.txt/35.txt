The calculation of the Interest Coverage Ratio shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no more than two months prior to the incurrence of Financial Indebtedness under item (j) of the definition of Permitted Debt, or the making of a Restricted Payment (as applicable). The Net Finance Charges shall be measured on the relevant testing date so determined, but include the new Financial Indebtedness provided it is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Finance Charges). EBITDA shall be calculated as set out in Clause 11.5 (Adjustments) and based on the figures set out in the most recent Financial Report.
(a) The figures for EBITDA and Net Finance Charges for the Relevant Period ending on the relevant Reference Date or test date shall be used but adjusted so that:
(i) entities acquired or disposed of by the Group during the Relevant Period, or after the end of the Relevant Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be included or excluded (as applicable), pro forma, for the entire Relevant Period; and
(ii) any entity to be acquired with the proceeds from new Financial Indebtedness shall be included, pro forma, for the entire Relevant Period.
(b) The figures for Net Financial Charges set out in the Financial Report as of the most recent quarter date (including when necessary, financial statements published before the Issue Date), shall be used, but adjusted so that Net Financial Charges for such period shall be:
(i) reduced by an amount equal to the Net Financial Charges directly attributable to any Financial Indebtedness of the Issuer or of any other Group Company repaid, repurchased or otherwise discharged with respect to the Issuer and the continuing Group Companies with the proceeds from disposals of entities referred to in the adjustment to EBITDA above (or, if the Financial Indebtedness is owed by a Group Company that is sold, the Net Financial Charges for such period directly attributable to the Financial Indebtedness of such Group Company to the extent the Issuer and the continuing Group Companies are no longer liable for such Financial Indebtedness after such sale);
21
(ii) increased on a proforma basis by an amount equal to the Net Financial Charges directly attributable to (i) any Financial Indebtedness owed by acquired entities referred to in the adjustment to EBITDA above, and (ii) any Financial Indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of such entities, in each case calculated as if all such debt had been incurred at the beginning of the relevant test period; and
(iii) increased on a proforma basis by an amount equal to the Net Financial Charges directly attributable to any new Financial Indebtedness, calculated as if such debt had been incurred at the beginning of the relevant test period.
