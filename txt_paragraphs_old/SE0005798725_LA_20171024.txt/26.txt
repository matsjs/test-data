8.5 The Issuer shall pay any stamp duty and other public fees accruing in connection with the Bond Issue or any Subsequent Bond Issue, but not in respect of trading in the secondary market (except to the extent required by applicable law), and shall not deduct at source any applicable withholding tax payable pursuant to law.

INTEREST
9.1 The Bonds will bear Interest at the Interest Rate applied to the Nominal Amount from, but excluding, the Issue Date up to and including the relevant Redemption Date. Any Bond issued pursuant to a Subsequent Bond Issue will, however, carry Interest at the Interest Rate from, but excluding, the Interest Payment Date falling immediately prior to its issuance up to and including the relevant Redemption Date.
9.2 Interest accrues during an Interest Period. Payment of Interest in respect of the Bonds shall be made quarterly in arrears to the Holders on each Interest Payment Date for the preceding Interest Period.
9.3 Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the Interest Period in respect of which payment is being made divided by 360 (actual/360-days basis).
9.4 If the Issuer fails to pay any amount due under these Terms and Conditions on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from, but excluding, the due
14
date up to and including the date of actual payment at a rate corresponding to the Interest Rate plus 2 %. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Agent or the CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay is attributable to a Force Majeure Event as set forth in Clause 23.1.
