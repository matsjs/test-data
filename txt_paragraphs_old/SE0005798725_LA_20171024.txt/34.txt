TERMINATION OF THE BONDS
12.1 The Agent is entitled, on behalf of the Holders, to terminate the Bonds and to declare all, but not only some, of the Bonds due for payment immediately or at such later date as the Agent determines (such later date not falling later than 20 Business Days from the date on which the Agent made such declaration), if:
(a) Non-Payment: the Issuer fails to pay an amount on the date it is due in accordance with these Terms and Conditions unless its failure to pay is due to technical or administrative error and is remedied within 5 Business Days of the due date;
(b) Other obligations: the Issuer does not comply with these Terms and Conditions in any other way than as set out under (a) above, provided that the Agent has requested the Issuer in writing to remedy such failure and the Issuer has not remedied the failure within 15 Business Days from such request (if the failure or violation according to the Agent (acting reasonably) is not capable of being remedied, the Agent may declare the Bonds payable without such prior written request);
