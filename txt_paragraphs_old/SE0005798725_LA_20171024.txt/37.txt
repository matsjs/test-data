12.2 Termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned in Clause 12.1 (b) or, regarding any Material Group Company (except for the Issuer), on the grounds mentioned in Clauses 12.1 (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), and (i) may only occur if the nature of the particular circumstance is such that it would have a Material Adverse Effect and that the cause of termination is continuing at the time of the Agent's declaration. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned in Clause 12.1 (d).
12.3 If the right to terminate the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law that the period of appeal has expired in order for cause of termination to be deemed to exist.
12.4 The Issuer is obliged to inform the Agent immediately if any circumstance of the type specified in Clause 12.1 should occur. Should the Agent not receive such information, the Agent is entitled to assume that no such circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Agent does not have knowledge of such circumstance. The Agent is under no obligations to make any investigations relating to the circumstances specified in Clause 12.1. The Issuer shall further, at the request of the Agent, provide the Agent with details of any circumstances referred to in Clause 12.1 and provide the Agent with all documents that may be of significance for the application of this Clause 12.
12.5 The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Agent according to Clause 12.4 if informing the Agent would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. If such a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with NASDAQ OMX Stockholm or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek the approval from NASDAQ OMX Stockholm or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Agent, in order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to Clause 12.4
12.6 If the Agent has been notified by the Issuer or has otherwise determined that there is a default under these Terms and Conditions according to Clause 12.1, the Agent shall decide, within 20 Business Days of the day of notification or determination, if the Bonds shall be declared terminated. If the Agent has decided not to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that there exists a right of termination and obtain instructions from the Holders according to the provisions in Clause 14 (Decisions by Holders). If the Holders vote in favour of termination and instruct the Agent to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall promptly

declare the Bonds terminated. However, if the cause for termination according to the Agent's appraisal has ceased before the termination, the Agent shall not terminate the Bonds. The Agent shall in such case, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that the cause for termination has ceased. The Agent shall always be entitled
to take the time necessary to consider whether an occurred event constitutes an Event of Default and whether such event has a Material Adverse Effect.
