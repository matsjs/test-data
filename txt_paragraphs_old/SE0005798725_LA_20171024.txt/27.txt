10 REDEMPTION AND REPURCHASE OF THE BONDS
10.1 Redemption at maturity
The Issuer shall redeem all, but not only some, of the outstanding Bonds in full on the Final Redemption Date (or, to the extent such day is not a Business Day, on the Business Day following from an application of the Business Day Convention) with an amount per Bond equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
10.2 The Group Companies' purchase of Bonds
Any Group Company may, subject to applicable law, at any time and at any price purchase Bonds. The Bonds held by a Group Company may at such Group Company's discretion be retained, sold or, if held by the Issuer, cancelled.
10.3 Early voluntary redemption by the Issuer (call option)
10.3.1 The Bonds may not be redeemed in advance by the Issuer, unless the redemption is financed by way of another issue of Market Loans which the bondholders may subscribe for, in which case all (but not only some) of the Bonds may be voluntarily redeemed by the Issuer, on any Business Day after the day falling 180 days before Final Redemption Date. The Bonds will be redeemed at a price equal to the Nominal Amount of each Bond together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon up until (and including) the Redemption Date.
10.3.2 Redemption in accordance with Clause 10.3.1 shall be made by the Issuer giving not less than 15 Business Days' notice to the Holders and the Agent. Any such notice shall state the Redemption Date and the relevant Record Date and is irrevocable but may, at the Issuer's discretion, contain one or more conditions precedent. Upon expiry of such notice and the fulfillment of the conditions precedent (if any), the Issuer is bound to redeem the Bonds in full at the applicable amount.
