RIGHT TO ACT ON BEHALF OF A HOLDER
7.1 If any person other than a Holder wishes to exercise any rights under these Terms and Conditions, it must obtain a power of attorney (or, if applicable, a coherent chain of power of attorney), a certificate from the authorised nominee or other sufficient proof of authorisation for such person.
7.2 A Holder may issue one or several powers of attorney to third parties to represent it in relation to some or all of the Bonds held by it. Any such representative may act independently under these Terms and Conditions in relation to the Bonds for which such representative is entitled to represent the Holder and may further delegate its right to represent the Holder by way of a further power of attorney.
7.3 The Agent shall only have to examine the face of a power of attorney or other proof of authorization that has been provided to it pursuant to Clause 7.1 and 7.2 and may assume that it has been duly authorised, is valid, has not been revoked or superseded and that it is in full force and effect, unless otherwise is apparent from its face.
