The Issuer shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Bonds are listed at the corporate bond list on Nasdaq Stockholm no later than 30 days after the First Issue Date and the Issuer shall take all reasonable measures to ensure that the Bonds are listed accordingly, provided that the Bonds shall in any case be listed within 60 days after the First Issue Date, and the Issuer shall thereafter take all measures required to ensure that the Bonds, once listed on Nasdaq Stockholm, continue being listed on Nasdaq Stockholm for as long as any Bond is outstanding (however, taking into account the rules and regulations of Nasdaq Stockholm and the CSD (as amended from time to time) preventing trading in the Bonds in close connection to the redemption of the Bonds).
The Issuer shall procure that no substantial change is made to the general nature of the business carried on by the Group if such substantial change would have a Material Adverse Effect.
Financial Indebtedness
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of its Subsidiaries will, incur, prolong, renew or extend any Financial Indebtedness, provided however that the Issuer and its Subsidiaries have a right to incur Financial Indebtedness that constitutes Permitted Debt.
Disposals of assets
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that no Subsidiary, sell or otherwise dispose of shares in any Subsidiary or of all or substantially all of its or that Subsidiary's assets, or operations to any person not being the Issuer or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, unless the transaction is carried out at fair market value and on terms and conditions customary for such transaction and provided that it does not have a Material Adverse Effect.
Negative pledge
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of its Subsidiaries, provide, prolong or renew any security over any of its/their assets (present or future) to secure Financial Indebtedness, provided however that the Group Companies have a right to (i) provide, prolong and renew any Permitted Security, and (ii) retain, but not prolong or renew, any existing security in relation to indebtedness held by an entity acquired, unless it constitutes Permitted Security.
