Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Security Agent otherwise directs, no Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason ofperformance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents:
(i) to be indemnified by an Obligor;
(ii) to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;
(iii) to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders under the Finance Documents or of any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Finance Documents by the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders;
(iv) to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor to make any payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has given a guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under Clause 8.4 (Guarantee and indemnity);
(v) to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor; and/or
(vi) to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders.
If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it shall hold that benefit, payment or distribution to the extent necessary to enable all amounts which may be or become payable to the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents to be repaid in full on trust for the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders and shall promptly pay or transfer the same to the Security Agent or as the Security Agent may direct for application in accordance with Clause 11.2 (Payment Mechanics).
