In case of doubt, the Bondholders' meeting decides which Bondholders can vote and how many votes each one has.
In the event that the Bondholders present represent less than 5/10 of the Loan Outstanding, decisions may only be made by a 2/3 majority of the Bonds represented. If the Bondholders present represent 5/10 or more of the Loan Outstanding, valid decisions may be made by a simple majority, see however Clause 17.8.
17.8 In the following matters a majority of 2/3 of the Bonds represented at the meeting must vote in favour of the decision:
(a) change of bondholders' representative,
(b) change of borrower,
(c) changes in the Loan Agreement's conditions, including interest, maturity, term and security/collateral, or
(d) changes in the Borrower's corporate structure which are of significant importance
for the fulfilment of the Loan Agreement.
