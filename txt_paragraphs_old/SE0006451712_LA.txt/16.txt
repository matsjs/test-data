2.2 The minimum permissible investment amount in connection with the issuance of the Bonds is SEK one million (1,000,000).
2.3 The Company undertakes to repay the Bonds, to pay interest and to otherwise act in accordance and comply with these Terms and Conditions.

The price of Bonds issued in a Subsequent Bond Issue may be set at a discount or at a higher price than the Nominal Amount and shall, for the avoidance of doubt, have the same ISIN, Interest Rate, Nominal Amount, Final Redemption Date and other rights as Bonds issued on the Issue Date.
