4.1 In the event of liquidation or insolvency of the Company, the Bonds will not be paid out of the Company's assets until all of the Company's unsubordinated debts have been paid in full. However, the Bonds shall rank pari passu with other outstanding subordinated debts, which are not explicitly subordinated to the Bonds.
5 The Bonds and transferability
5.1 Each Holder is bound by these Terms and Conditions without there being any further actions required to be taken or formalities to be complied with.
5.2 The Bonds are freely transferable. All Bond transfers are subject to the terms of these Terms and Conditions and these Terms and Conditions are automatically applicable in relation to all Bond transferees upon completed transfer.
5.3 Holders may be subject to purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Bonds, as applicable from time to time under local laws to which a Holder may be subject (due e.g. to its nationality, its residency, its registered address or its place(s) for doing business). Each Holder must ensure compliance with local laws and regulations applicable at own cost and expense.
5.4 The Bonds have not been registered under the US Securities Act and the Company is under no obligation to arrange for registration of the Bonds under the US Securities Act or under any other law or regulation.
6 Interest
The Bonds will bear interest at the Interest Rate applied to the Nominal Amount from, but excluding, the Issue Date up to, and including, the Redemption Date. Any Bond issued in a Subsequent Bond Issue will, however, bear interest at the Interest Rate applied to the Nominal Amount from, but excluding, the Interest Payment Date falling immediately prior to its issuance up to, and including, the Redemption Date. The interest will be paid in arrears on each Interest Payment Date and shall be calculated on a 30/360-days basis.
