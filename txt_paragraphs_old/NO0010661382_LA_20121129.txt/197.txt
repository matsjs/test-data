applicable law on any payments to the Bondholders.
If the Issuer is required by law to withhold any withholding tax from any
payment under any Finance Document:
(i) the amount of the payment due from the Issuer shall be increased to such amount which is necessary to ensure that the Bondholders receive a net amount which is (after making the required withholding) equal to the payment which would have been due if no withholding had been required; and
(ii) the Issuer shall at the request of the Bond Trustee deliver to the Bond Trustee evidence that the required tax reduction or withholding has been made.
19. EVENTS OF DEFAULT
The Bonds may be declared by the Bond Trustee to be in default upon occurrence of any of the following events (which shall be referred to as an "Event of Default") if:
19.1 Non-payment Any of the Obligors fails to fulfil any payment obligation due under this Bond Agreement or any Finance Document when due, unless, in the opinion of the Bond Trustee, it is likely that such payment will be made in full, within 5 Business Days following the original due date.
19.2 Breach of other obligations Any Obligor does not comply with any provision pursuant to this Bond Agreement or any other Finance Document, unless, in the opinion of the Bond Trustee, such failure is capable of being remedied and is remedied within 15 Business Days after notice thereof is given to the Issuer by the Bond Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, such 15 Business Days' remedy period shall not apply in respect of Clause 15.4.
