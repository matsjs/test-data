Equity cure
If, within twenty (20) Business Days of the delivery of a Compliance Certificate evidencing a breach of the Maintenance Test, the Issuer has received an equity injection in cash by way of a share issue in the Issuer or an unconditional shareholder contribution to the Issuer in a sufficient amount to ensure compliance with the Maintenance Test (the "Cure Amount"), no Event of Default will occur (an "Equity Cure"). Upon receipt of the Cure Amount, the calculation of the Maintenance Test shall, for the purpose of the calculations of the Maintenance Test only, be adjusted by increasing EBITDA by an amount equal to the Cure Amount.
Any Equity Cure made in any calendar quarter shall be included until such time as that calendar quarter falls outside the Relevant Period. Any Equity Cure must be made in cash to the Company and no more than three (3) Equity Cures may be made over the lifetime of the Bonds. Equity Cures may not be made in respect of any consecutive calendar quarters.
SPECIAL UNDERTAKINGS
So long as any Bond remains outstanding, the Issuer undertakes to comply with the special undertakings set forth in this Clause 13.
