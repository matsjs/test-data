If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in this Clause 16, the Agent shall take every reasonable measure necessary to recover the amounts outstanding under the Bonds.
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with this Clause 16, the Issuer shall redeem all Bonds with an amount per Bond equal to the applicable Call Option Price together with accrued but unpaid Interest, other than if the acceleration of the Bonds are caused by an Acquisition Failure Event and/or New Issue Failure in which case the Bonds shall be redeemed with an amount per Bond equal to 101.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest. Such redemption may be funded with amounts standing to the credit of the Escrow Account, with any shortfall to be covered by the Issuer.
DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS
If the Bonds have been declared due and payable in accordance with Clause 16 (Termination of the Bonds), all payments by the Issuer relating to the Bonds shall be distributed in the following order of priority, in accordance with the instructions of the Agent:
(a) firstly, in or towards payment pro rata of (i) all unpaid fees, costs, expenses and indemnities payable by the Issuer to the Agent, in its capacity as agent or security agent under the Finance Documents, (ii) other costs, expenses and indemnities relating to the termination of the Bonds, the enforcement of the Transaction Security or the protection of the Holders' rights under the Finance Documents, (iii) any non reimbursed costs incurred by the Agent for external experts, and (iv) any non reimbursed costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in relation to a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure, together with default interest on any such amount calculated from the date it was due to be paid or reimbursed;
(b) secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of accrued but unpaid Interest under the Bonds (Interest due on an earlier Interest Payment Date to be paid before any Interest due on a later Interest Payment Date);
(c) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid principal under the Bonds; and
(d) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under the Finance Documents.
Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with items (a) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer (as applicable). The application of proceeds in accordance with items (a) to (d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal.
