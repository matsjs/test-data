THE AMOUNT OF THE BONDS AND UNDERTAKING TO MAKE PAYMENTS
The Issuer may at one or more occasions after the First Issue Date issue Subsequent Bonds under these Terms and Conditions (each such issue, a "Subsequent Bond Issue"), until the total amount under such Subsequent Bond Issue(s) and the Initial Bond Issue equals SEK 500,000,000, always provided that the Incurrence Test (calculated pro forma including such issue) is met. Subsequent Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the Interest Rate, the Nominal Amount, the Final Redemption Date and other rights applicable to the Bonds issued on the First Issue Date shall apply also to Subsequent Bonds. The price of Subsequent Bonds may be set at par, at a discount or at a higher price than the Nominal Amount.
The Issuer undertakes to repay the Bonds, to pay Interest and to otherwise act in accordance and comply with these Terms and Conditions.
The Bonds are denominated in SEK and each Bond is constituted by these Terms and Conditions.
By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Holder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Bonds each subsequent Holder confirms such agreements.
STATUS OF THE BONDS
The Bonds constitute direct, general, unconditional, unsubordinated and secured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank at least pari passu with all direct, general,
unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and without any preference among them. The Bonds are secured by the Transaction Security.
