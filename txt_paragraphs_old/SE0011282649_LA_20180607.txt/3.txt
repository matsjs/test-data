"Calculation Principles" means:
(a) for the purpose of the Incurrence Test, that the calculation of the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no more than two (2) months prior to the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness (including any Subsequent Bond Issue), which requires that the Incurrence Test is met;
(b) for the purpose of the Distribution Test, that the calculation of the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no more than two (2) months prior to the payment of the Restricted Payment, which requires that the Distribution Test is met;
(c) that the Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date so determined, but include the Restricted Payment or the new Financial Indebtedness (as applicable), provided that such Financial Indebtedness is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt);
(d) that the calculation of the Interest Coverage Ratio shall be made for the Relevant Period ending on the last day of the period covered by the most recent Financial Report; and
(e) that the figures for EBITDA, Finance Charges and Net Finance Charges for the Relevant Period ending on the last day of the period covered by the most recent Financial Report shall be used, but adjusted so that:
(i) any Bond that has been repurchased, and not resold, by any Group Company during the Relevant Period, or after the end of the Relevant Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be excluded, proforma, for the entire Relevant Period;
(ii) entities acquired or disposed of by the Group during the Relevant Period, or after the end of the Relevant Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be included or excluded (as applicable), pro forma, for the entire Relevant Period; and
