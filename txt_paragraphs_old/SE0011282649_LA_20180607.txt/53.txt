(actual/360-days adjusted modified following basis).
If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it under these Terms and Conditions on its
due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from (but excluding) the due date
up to (and including) the date of actual payment at a rate which is one hundred (100) basis
points higher than the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No
default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Agent or the
CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
