8.1.2
If payment or repayment is effectuated in accordance with this Clause 6, the Issuer and the CSD shall be deemed to have fulfilled their obligation to pay, irrespective if such payment was made to a person not entitled to receive such amount.
DEFAULT INTEREST
If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date o f actual payment at a rate which is two (2) per cent. higher than the relevant Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue in case the failure to pay was attributable to the Agent or the CSD, in which case the relevant Interest Rate shall apply instead.
APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF THE AGENT
Appointment of Agent
By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder appoints the Agent to act as its agent in all matters relating to the Notes and the Finance Documents, and authorises the Agent to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Notes held by such Noteholder. By acquiring Notes, each subsequent Noteholder confirms such appointment and authorisation for the Agent to act on its behalf.
Each Noteholder shall immediately upon request provide the Agent with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent), that the Agent deems necessary or desirable for the purpose o f carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents. The Agent is under no obligation to represent a Noteholder which does not comply with such request.
No Noteholder may take any actions whatsoever on its own against the Issuer in matters relating to the Notes or the Finance Documents, unless the Agent has been instructed by the Noteholders to take certain actions against the Issuer but refrains from taking, or is unable to take, such actions within reasonable time.
