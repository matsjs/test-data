payments to be made in June and December 2014 may, at the Issuer's discretion, be made in cash or up to 50% as PIK in the form of additional Bonds (based on the Face Value), calculated based on the total number of Bonds at each Interest Payment Date, rounded down to the nearest NOK.
9.4 The day count fraction ("Fixed Rate Day Count Fraction") in respect of the calculation of the payable interest amount shall be "30/360", which means that the number of days in the calculation period in respect of which payment is being made divided by 360 (the number of days to be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days with twelve 30-days months (unless (a) the last day of the calculation period is the 31st day of a month but the first day of the calculation period is a day other than the 30th or 31st day of a month, in which case the month that includes that last day shall not be considered to be shortened to a 30-day month, or (b) the last day of the calculation period is the last day of the month of February, in which case the month of February shall not be considered to be lengthened to a 30-day month)).
9.5 In the event that the Issuer opts to pay any interest in kind (i.e. as PIK) pursuant to Clause 9.2, the Issuer shall inform the Bond Trustee and the Bondholders (via the Securities Depository and the Paying Agent) at latest at 16:00 hours Oslo time on the Business Day immediately prior to the Interest Payment Date for the relevant interest calculation period for which the Issuer will pay as PIK. The Paying Agent shall carry the PIK into effect at the relevant Interest Payment Date. The additional Bonds issued as PIK give the same rights as the other issued Bonds (including without limitation with respect to conversion) as of the registration of the increased outstanding amount of the Bonds in the Securities Depositary, and shall be deemed to constitute part of the Bonds.
9.6 The payable interest amount per Bond for a relevant calculation period shall be calculated as follows:
Interest = Amount
