The Issuer may, at one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Notes, provided that (i) no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue, and (ii) the Loan to Value covenant will not be breached as a result of such subsequent issue. Subsequent Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, and, for the

Each Subsequent Note shall entitle its holder to Interest in accordance with Clause 8.1, and otherwise have the same rights as the Initial Notes.
