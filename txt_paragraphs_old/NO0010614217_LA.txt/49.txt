Notwithstanding the above, the Rig Owning Subsidiaries shall be allowed to grant loans to the Issuer if such loans are credited only to the Issuer's Earnings Account.
(e) Financial assistance - the Group The Issuer shall ensure that no Group Company (except the Rig Owning Subsidiaries which are regulated separately by Clause 13.4 (d)) shall grant any loans, guarantees or other financial assistance (including, but not limited to granting security) to any third party (including any shareholder of the Issuer) not being a member of the Group, other than (i) in the ordinary course of business, (ii) as part of customary long term financing of future land rigs or (iii) the Security Interests.
