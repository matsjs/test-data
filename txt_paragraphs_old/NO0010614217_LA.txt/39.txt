(a) the numerator shall be the number of Rigs that is (directly or indirectly) disposed of by any Rig Owning Subsidiary and therefore triggers the Mandatory Prepayment Event; and
(b) the denominator shall be the total number of Rigs which is subject to Security Interests immediately prior the Mandatory Prepayment Event.
For the avoidance of doubt, if one Rig is sold, and six Rigs are subject to Security Interests, then 1/6 of the Outstanding Bonds shall be redeemed. If ownership in a Subsidiary owning three Rigs is reduced to below 100%, and five Rigs are subject to Security Interests, then 3/5 of the Outstanding Bonds shall be redeemed.
For the avoidance of doubt, the redemption price shall be determined based on the date the Mandatory Prepayment Event occurred and not based on the date the repayment is carried out.
Any remaining proceeds from the sale of a Rig after mandatory prepayment has been carried out in accordance with the above provisions shall be at the Issuer's free disposal free of any Security Interests but shall be subject to the covenants and undertakings set out in Clause 13 hereof
