NOTEHOLDERS' COMMITTEE
Each Noteholder is entitled to nominate candidates to the Noteholders' Committee by notice to Agent no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Noteholders' Meeting. At the Noteholders Meeting all candidates so nominated shall be presented to the Noteholders. Each Noteholder that is entitled to vote shall for such election have the same number of votes to cast for each Note as the total number of persons to be elected. A Noteholder may cast its votes for one or several of the candidates. The candidates that receive the most votes shall be elected to the Noteholders' Committee.
A Noteholders' Committee may enter into discussions with the Issuer and other creditors of the Issuer and by majority decision among its members (i) adopt such procedural rules as it considers appropriate and (ii) prepare proposals and recommendations to the Noteholders. A Noteholders' Committee may not bind the Noteholders to any agreement or decision. The Agent shall provide reasonable assistance to the Noteholders' Committee and participate in its meetings.
The Noteholders' Committee may agree with the Issuer not to disclose information received from the Issuer provided that it, in the reasonable opinion of the Noteholders' Committee, is beneficial to the interests of the Noteholders. The Agent shall be a party to such agreement and receive the same information from the Issuer as the Noteholders' Committee.
The Noteholders' Committee and the Issuer may agree that the Issuer shall pay certain costs and expenses incurred by the Noteholders' Committee. Otherwise the Noteholders' Committee is not entitled to be reimbursed for any costs or expenses.
