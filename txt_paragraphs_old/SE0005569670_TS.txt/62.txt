Funds that the Agent receives (directly or indirectly) in connection with the acceleration of the Notes constitute escrow funds (Sw.; redovisningsmedel) and must be held on a separate interest-bearing account on behalf of the Noteholders and the other interested parties. The Agent shall arrange for payments of such funds in accordance with this Clause 15 as soon as reasonably practicable.
If the Issuer or the Agent shall make any payment under this Clause 15, the Issuer or the Agent, as applicable, shall notify the Noteholders of any such payment at least fifteen (15) Business Days before the payment is made. Such notice shall specify the Record Date, the payment date and the amount to be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any Interest due but unpaid the Record Date specified in Clause 7.1 shall apply and for any partial redemption in accordance with Clause 10.3 due but not made, the Record Date specified in Clause 10.3.2 shall apply.
