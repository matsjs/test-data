17.3 17.4
DECISIONS BY NOTEHOLDERS
A request by the Agent for a decision by the Noteholders on a matter relating to the Finance Documents shall (at the option of the Agent) be dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure.
Any request from the Issuer or a Noteholder (or Noteholders) representing at least ten (10) per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount (such request may only be validly made by a person who is a Noteholder on the Business Day immediately following the day on which the request is received by the Agent and shall, if made by several Noteholders, be made by them jointly) for a decision by the Noteholders on a matter relating to the Finance Documents shall be directed to the Agent and dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting or by way a Written Procedure, as determined by the Agent. The person requesting the decision may suggest the form for decision making, but if it is in the Agent's opinion more appropriate that a matter is dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting than by way of a Written Procedure, it shall be dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the appointment of a Noteholders' Committee shall always be dealt with at a Noteholders' Meeting.
The Agent may refrain from convening a Noteholders' Meeting or instigating a Written Procedure if (i) the suggested decision must be approved by any person in addition to the Noteholders and such person has informed the Agent that an approval will not be given, or (ii) the suggested decision is not in accordance with applicable laws.
Only a person who is, or who has been provided with a power of attorney pursuant to Clause 6 (Right to act on behalf of a Noteholder) from a person who is, registered as a Noteholder:
a) on the Record Date prior to the date of the Noteholders' Meeting, in respect of a Noteholders' Meeting; or
b) on the Business Day specified in the communication pursuant to Clause 19.3, in respect of a Written Procedure,
may exercise voting rights as a Noteholder at such Noteholders' Meeting or in such Written Procedure, provided that the relevant Notes are included in the definition of Adjusted Nominal Amount.
