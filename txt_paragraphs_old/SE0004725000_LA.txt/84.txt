13.10 Acceleration of the Bonds
(a) If an Event of Default has occurred or might occur, the Issuer is obliged to inform the Bond Trustee as soon as possible and in any event no later than 15 Business Days after the Issuer becomes aware or should reasonable become aware of the occurrence of an Event of Default or that an Event of Default might occur. Should the Bond Trustee not receive such information, the Bond Trustee is entitled to assume that no Event of Default exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Bond Trustee does not have knowledge of such circumstance.
(b) If the Bond Trustee has been notified by the Issuer or otherwise has determined (acting reasonably) that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Bond Trustee shall be entitled to (but is not obliged to), in order to protect the interests of the Bondholders, declare the Bonds, including accrued interest, costs and expenses immediately due and payable.
(c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Bond Trustee shall promptly by written notice to the Issuer declare the outstanding Bonds including accrued interest, costs and expenses to be in default and due for payment if:
(i) the Bond Trustee receives a demand in writing from Bondholders representing at least 20 per cent of the Adjusted Nominal Amount, which for the avoidance of doubt shall not require a Bondholders' Meeting, or
(ii) the Bondholders' Meeting has with simple majority decided that the Bonds shall be declared immediately due and payable.
In either case the Bond Trustee shall take every measure necessary to recover the amounts due under the Bonds.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Bondholders' Meeting has decided that no acceleration in respect of a specific Event of Default shall be initiated, no individual Bondholder may initiate an acceleration in accordance with paragraph (c) (i) above with respect to such Event of Default.
