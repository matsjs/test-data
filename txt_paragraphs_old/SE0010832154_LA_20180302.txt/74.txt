The Issuer is only obligated to inform the Agent according to Clause 15.4 if informing the
Agent would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with Nasdaq
Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable). If such a conflict would exist
pursuant to the listing contract with the relevant Regulated Market or otherwise, the Issuer
shall however be obligated to either seek the approval from the relevant Regulated Market or
undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement
with the Agent, in order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to Clause 15.4.
