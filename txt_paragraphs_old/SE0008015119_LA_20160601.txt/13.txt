The nominal amount of each Bond is SEK 1,000,000 (the "Nominal Amount"). All Initial Bonds are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of hundred per cent, of the Nominal Amount.
The Bonds constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu and without any preference among them, and at least pari passu with all other direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer other than those mandatorily preferred by law.
The Bonds are freely transferable but the Bondholders may be subject to purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Bonds, as applicable, under local laws to which a Bondholder may be subject. Each Bondholder must ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.
No action is being taken in any jurisdiction that would or is intended to permit a public offering of the Bonds or the possession, circulation or distribution of any document or other material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any jurisdiction other than Sweden, where action for that purpose is required. Each Bondholder must inform itself about, and observe, any applicable restrictions to the transfer of material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds.
