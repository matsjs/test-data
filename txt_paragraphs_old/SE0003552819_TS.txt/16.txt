5 Interest The Bonds will bear interest at the Interest Rate applied to the Nominal Amount from the Issue Date up to and including the Redemption Date. The interest will be paid in arrears on each Interest Payment Date and shall be calculated on a 30/360-days basis.
6.1 The Bonds will be issued in accordance with the Financial Instruments Accounts Act and
registered on behalf of the Holders on a Securities Account. No physical notes will be issued. Registration requests relating to the Bonds shall be directed to an Account Operator. Those who, according to assignment, pledge, the provisions of the Swedish Children and Parents Code (Sw. Foraldrabalken 1949:381), conditions of will or deed of gift or otherwise have acquired a right to receive payments in respect of a Bond shall register their entitlement to receive payment. The Company shall be entitled to obtain information from the register kept by the CSD in respect of the Bonds (Sw. skuldbok). At the request of the Issuing Agent, the Company shall request and provide such information to the Issuing Agent.
7 Redemption of the Bonds and payments 7.1 Redemption at maturity
The Company shall redeem all outstanding Bonds at the Nominal Amount on the Final Redemption Date. Payment of the Nominal Amount and interest will be made to the person who is a Holder on the Record Date.
7.2 Payments of principal and interest If a Holder has registered, through an Account Operator, that capital and interest shall be paid to a designated bank account, such payment will be effected by the CSD on the relevant payment date. In other cases, payments will be transferred by the CSD to the Holder at the address registered with the CSD on the Record Date. If a day on which an amount becomes due and payable is not a Banking Day the amount will be deposited or transferred the next following Banking Day. However, interest only accrues up to and including the relevant due date. Should the CSD, due to a delay on behalf of the Company or some other obstacle, not be able to effect the payment of amounts according to the aforesaid, the CSD will pay such amount to the Holders on the Record Date as soon as possible after such obstacle has been removed. If a person to whom payment has been made in accordance with the above was not entitled to receive such payment, the Company and the CSD shall nevertheless be deemed to have fulfilled their obligations, provided that the Company and/or the CSD did not have knowledge that such payment was made to a person not entitled to receive such amount and provided the Company and/or the CSD acted with normal care.
