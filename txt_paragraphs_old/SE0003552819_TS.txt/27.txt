15 Amendments of the Terms and Conditions
15.1 The Issuing Agent may, on account of the Holders, agree with the Company to amend these Terms and Conditions as long as such amendment does not limit the obligation of the Company to pay amounts of principal or interest or in any other way, to the Issuing Agents reasonable discretion, may materially adversely affect the interests of the Holders or that such amendment is solely made in purpose to rectify obvious errors and mistakes in these Terms and Conditions. After resolutions of the Holders according to Section 13, the Issuing Agent may also agree with the Company to make other amendments.
Since the Bonds are to be listed on OMX, the Issuing Agent may, on account of the Holders, agree with the Company to make necessary amendments to these Terms and Conditions to ensure that they comply with any requirements for listing, as long as such amendments do not materially adversely affect the interests of the Holders.
The Issuing Agent may also, on account of the Holders, approve to a Swedish translation of these Terms and Conditions necessary in connection with a listing on OMX. In case of any discrepancies between the English text and the Swedish translation, the Swedish text shall prevail.
