(a) Ranking and subordination
(i) The Issuer's obligations under this Bond Agreement and any other Finance Document shall at all times rank at least pari passu with the claims of all the Issuer's other unsubordinated creditors, save for those whose claims are preferred solely by any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or other similar laws of general application.
(ii) The Issuer shall procure that all of the Issuer's debt towards Parent or any other company in the Parent's group (if any) and all payments to the Vessel Managers under the Management Agreements are fully subordinated to the Issuer's obligations under the Finance Documents. The subordination referred to in this Clause 13.3(a)(ii) shall not prevent the Issuer to service such obligations as long as no Default has occurred and is continuing.
