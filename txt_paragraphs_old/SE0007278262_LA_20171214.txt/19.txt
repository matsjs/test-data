Funds that the Agent receives (directly or indirectly) on behalf of the Holders in connection
with the enforcement of any or all of the security granted under the Mortgage Agreement or
the enforcement of the Parent Guarantee constitute escrow funds (Sw. redovisningsmedel)
according to the Escrow Funds Act (Sw. lag (1944:181) om redovisningsmedel) and must be
held on a separate interest-bearing account on behalf of the Holders and any other interested
party. The Agent shall promptly arrange for payments to be made to the Plolders in such
case. If the Agent deems it appropriate, it may, in accordance with Clause 5.7, instruct the
CSD to arrange for payment to the Holders.
