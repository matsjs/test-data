13.1 General
13.1.2 Condition 13.1.1 shall not apply if the Agent has been instructed by the Holders in accordance with the Terms and Conditions to take certain actions but fails for any reason to take, or is unable to take (for any reason other than a failure by a Holder to provide immediately upon the Agent's request any such documents, including a written power of attorney, that the Agent deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carry out its duties under the Terms and Conditions), such actions within a reasonable period of time and such failure or inability is continuing. However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by the non payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under the Terms and Conditions or the Agency Agreement or by any reason described in Condition 13.1.3, such failure must continue for at least forty (40) Business Days after the Agent has notified the Holders that it will cease to perform its obligations by reason of the non-payment of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under the Terms and Conditions or the Agency Agreement or by any reason described in Condition 13.1.3 before a Holder may take any action referred to in Condition 13.1.1.
13.1 3 If in the Agent's reasonable opinion the cost, loss or liability which it may incur (including reasonable fees to the Agent) in complying with instructions of the Holders, or taking any action at its own initiative, will not be covered by the Issuer, the Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with such instructions, or taking such action, until it has received such funding or indemnities (or adequate Security has been provided therefore) as it may reasonably require.

13.2 Holders' meeting and procedure in writing
(a) The Agent is entitled, and shall following a demand in writing from a Holder (or Holders) representing at least ten (10) per cent, of the Adjusted Total Nominal Amount (such demand may only be validly made by a person who is a Holder on the Business Day immediately following the day on which the demand is received by the Agent and shall, if made by several Holders, be made by them jointly), on behalf of the Holders, call for a Holders' meeting or demand for a procedure in writing among the Holders. Holders representing at least ten (10) per cent of the Total Nominal Amount may demand from the Agent that such call is made.
(b) A demand by a Holder (or Holders) in accordance with Condition 13.2 (a) shall be made in writing to the Agent including (i) information regarding the issues that shall be discussed and (ii) documentation which indicates the holding of the relevant Holders. If the Agent establishes that such demand has been received in due order the Agent shall, within twenty (20) Banking Days from receipt of such demand, call to a meeting or demand for a procedure in writing. Such obligation does not exist if, according to the Agent, (i) the proposal must be approved by the Company and the Company informs the Agent that it will not give such approval, (ii) the proposal is not in accordance with applicable laws, rules or regulations or cannot be implemented due to technical restrictions at the CSD or the NASDAQ OMX Stockholm Exchange or (iii) it is clearly unlikely that the meeting will consent to the proposal in view of previous meetings or procedures in writing.
(c) Notice shall be made to the Holders and the Agent or, as the case may be, the Company in accordance with Condition 17 (Notices) below and shall be made not later than ten (10) Banking Days and not earlier than thirty (30) Banking Days prior to the meeting or the last day for replies. The notice shall include (i) time for the meeting or the last day for replies, (ii) place for the meeting or address for replies, (iii) agenda for the meeting, (iv) information regarding which day a Holder shall be registered as owner or underlying holder, in case of nominee registration and such possibility is provided by the CSD to be entitled to vote, in the register of the CSD and (v) what is otherwise required by a Holder in order to attend the meeting. The Company or, if the Agent is calling, the Agent shall determine the contents in the notice and provide, in writing or electronically, a proxy form for the Holders to participate at the meeting by proxy or, in case of a procedure in writing, a decision form with the relevant alternatives for resolution.
(d) A resolution is passed through voting at a meeting (or, in case of a procedure in writing, through calculation), at which each Holder included in the definition of Adjusted Total Nominal Amount is entitled to vote. Each Note shall entitle its Holder to one vote per EUR 100,000 of the Nominal Amount held by such Holder. A Holder that holds more than one Note must vote in the same manner for all Notes held. However, a representative who represents different Holders may vote differently for different Holders and an authorised nominee in accordance with the Swedish Financial Instruments Accounts Act ( 1998:1479) may vote differently for different underlying accountholders. The resolution of the Holders shall, subject to the requirements for Qualified Majority set out in 13.2 (e) below, be the opinion which represents the majority of the Adjusted Total Nominal Amount for the Notes.
