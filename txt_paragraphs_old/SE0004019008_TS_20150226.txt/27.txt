10.1 By a separate guarantee document dated on the date of these Terms and Conditions (the "Guarantee Document"), each Group Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally, jointly and severally (solidariskt), as principal obligor (proprieborgen) has guaranteed to the Secured Parties as represented by the Agent:
(a) the punctual performance of the Secured Obligations; and
(b) that whenever the Company does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with the Secured Obligations, that Group Guarantor shall immediately upon request by the Agent pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor.
10.2 Each Group Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally, jointly and severally (solidariskt), has agreed with the Secured Parties as represented by the Agent that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify the Secured Parties as represented by the Agent immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as a result of the Company not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under the Finance Documents on the date when it would have been due. The amount payable by a Group Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the amount it would have had to pay under this Section 10 if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a guarantee.
