(i) the Trustee to act as its agent and representative in all matters relating to the Bonds and the Finance Documents, and authorises the Trustee to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent, unless such consent is specifically required by these Terms and Conditions) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Bonds held by such Bondholder and to exercise such rights, powers, authorities and discretions as are specifically delegated to the Trustee by these Terms and Conditions and the Finance Documents together with all such rights, powers, authorities and discretions as are incidental thereto;

will be considered to have irrevocably transferred to the Trustee all its procedural rights and legal authority to claim and collect any and all receivables under the Bonds, enforce any Finance Document and to receive any funds in respect of the Bonds or under the Finance Documents (Fin: prokurasiirto) as a result of which transfer, the Trustee shall be irrevocably entitled to take all such action in its own name but on behalf of and for the benefit of each Bondholder (at the expense of the Bondholders); and
(b) Each Bondholder shall immediately upon request provide the Trustee with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee), that the Trustee deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents. The Trustee is under no obligation to represent a Bondholder which does not comply with such request if due to such failure the Trustee is unable to represent such Bondholder.
