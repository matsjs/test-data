(c) If, due to any obstacle for the CSD, the Issuer cannot make a payment or repayment, such payment or repayment may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed. Interest shall accrue in accordance with Clause 8(d) during such postponement.
(d) If payment or repayment is made in accordance with this Clause 7, the Issuer and the CSD shall be deemed to have fulfilled their obligation to pay, irrespective of whether such payment was made to a person not entitled to receive such amount.

(f) The Issuer is responsible for withholding any withholding tax imposed by applicable law on any payments to the Bondholders.
(g) If the Issuer is required by law to withhold any withholding tax from any payment under any Finance Document:
(i) the amount of the payment due from the Issuer shall be increased to such amount which is necessary to ensure that the Bondholders receive a net amount which is (after making the required withholding) equal to the payment which would have been due if no withholding had been required; and
(ii) the Issuer shall at the request of the Agent deliver to the Agent evidence that the required tax reduction or withholding has been made.
(h) If any withholding tax is imposed due to subsequent changes in applicable law after the date of these Terms and Conditions, the Issuer shall have the right to call all but not some of the Bonds at 100 per cent of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid interest. Such call shall be notified by the Issuer in writing to the Agent and the Bondholders at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the settlement date of the call.
