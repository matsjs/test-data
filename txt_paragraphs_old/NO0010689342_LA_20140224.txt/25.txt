8. Interest
(a) Each SEK Bond carries Interest at the Interest Rate from (but excluding) the Issue Date up to (and including) the relevant Redemption Date and each NOK Bond carries Interest at the Interest Rate from (and including) the Issue Date up to (but excluding) the relevant Redemption Date.
(b) Interest accrues during an Interest Period. Payment of Interest in respect of the Bonds shall be made to the Bondholders on each Interest Payment Date for the preceding Interest Period.
(c) Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the Interest Period in respect of which payment is being made divided by 360 (actual/360 days basis).
(d) If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount (i) in respect of the SEK Bonds from (but excluding) the due date up to (and including) the date of actual payment at a rate which is two (2) per cent higher than the Interest Rate, and (ii) in respect of the NOK Bonds from (and including) the due date up to (but excluding) the date of actual payment at a rate which is two (2) per cent higher than the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised.
