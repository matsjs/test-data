The Borrower's Bonds do not give the right to vote and are not taken into account when determining the number of voting Bonds. In case of doubt, the Bondholders' meeting decides which Bondholders can vote and how many votes each one has. 17.7 In order for the Bondholders' meeting to be able to make valid decisions, Bondholders representing at least 5/10 of the Outstanding Loan must be represented, sec however Clausel8. Valid decisions may be made by a simple majority, see however Clause 17.8. 17.8 In the following matters a majority of 2/3 of the Bonds represented at the meeting must vote in favour of the decision:
sccurity/collateral, or (d) corporate or business changes in the Borrower which are of significant importance
for the fulfilment of the Loan Agreement.
17.9 In all matters where unanimity is not attained, the voting shall be in writing and the number of votes shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. In the case of a tie in the votes, the matter shall be decided by the chairman, even if he is not a Bondholder or proxy. Decisions made at a Bondholders'meeting which entail changes to the Loan Agreement shall be attached to the Loan Agreement in the form of a certified copy of the minutes o f the meeting.
