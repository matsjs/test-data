INTERCREDITOR PRINCIPLES
General To establish the rights of the creditors under both the initial bond financing (the "Initial Bond Financing") and the additional facility (the "Additional Facility"), the Intercreditor Agreement will be entered into on or before the Issuer's entry into of the Additional Facility by: (a) the Issuer; (b) Tizir Titanium & Iron AS ("TTI"), TiZir Mauritius Limited and Grand Cote Operations
(collectively, the "Subsidiaries", and together with the Issuer, the "Group Companies"); (c) the security agent which will hold the security on behalf of the Secured Creditors (as defined below) (the "Security Agent"); (d) the Trustee on behalf of the registered holders of the Bonds (the "Secured Bond Creditors"); (e) each person that may accede thereto as a creditor under the Additional Facility (the "Additional Facility Creditors," and together with the Secured Bond Creditors, the "Secured Creditors"); and (f) the person that may accede thereto as facility agent under the Additional Facility (the "Additional Facility Agent"). Any other person may subsequently accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as provider of financial indebtedness subject to security over any relevant assets which require coordination according to these intercreditor principles. The Intercreditor Agreement shall be governed by Norwegian law. Ranking and Priority Each of the parties to the Intercreditor Agreement will agree that the liabilities owed by the Issuer to the Secured Creditors shall rank in right and priority of payment in the following order: (a) first, the liabilities owed by the Issuer to the Secured Creditors (the "Secured Creditors' Liabilities") , passu and without any preference between them; and (b) second, subject to discharge of the security documents, the liability owed to any other relevant person.
