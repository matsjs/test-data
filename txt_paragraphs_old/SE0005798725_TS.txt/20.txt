2.2 The Issuer may choose not to issue the full amount of Bonds on the Issue Date and may in such case, provided that the Incurrence Test is met, and provided that no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue, choose to issue the remaining amount of Bonds at one or more subsequent dates ("Subsequent Bond Issue"). The price of Bonds issued in a Subsequent Bond Issue may be set at the Nominal Amount or at a higher or lower amount than the Nominal Amount. Bonds issued in a Subsequent Bond Issue shall be issued subject to the Terms and Conditions and, for the avoidance of doubt, have the same ISIN, Interest Rate, Nominal Amount, final maturity and other rights as Bonds issued on the Issue Date.
2.4 The Bonds are denominated in SEK and each Bond is constituted by these Terms and Conditions.
2.5 By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Holder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to these Terms and Conditions and by acquiring Bonds each subsequent Holder confirms such agreements.

STATUS OF THE BONDS
