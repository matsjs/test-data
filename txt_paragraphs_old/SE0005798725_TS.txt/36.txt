(iii) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction in respect of any Material Group Company;
(i) a decision is made that any Material Group Company shall be merged or demerged into a company which is not a Group Company, unless the Agent has given its consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) in writing prior to the merger and/or demerger (where consent is not to be understood as a waiver of the rights that applicable law at the time assigns the concerned creditors); or
(ii) the Issuer merges with any other person, or is subject to a demerger, with the effect that the Issuer is not the surviving entity;
(g) Creditors' process: any expropriation, attachment, sequestration, distress or execution or any analogous process in any jurisdiction affects any asset or assets of any Material Group Company having an aggregate value of an amount equal to or exceeding SEK 10,000,000 and is not discharged within 30 calendar days;
(h) Impossibility or illegality: it is or becomes impossible or unlawful for the Issuer to fulfill or perform any of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions or if the obligations under these Terms and Conditions are not, or cease to be, legal, valid, binding and enforceable; or
(i) Continuation of the business: a Material Group Company ceases to carry on its business, except if due to (i) a merger or demerger that is not prohibited by Clause 12.1 (f) above, (ii) a solvent liquidation of a Material Group Company other than the Issuer and (iii) a disposal which is not prohibited by Clause 11.6.

12.2 Termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned in Clause 12.1 (b) or, regarding any Material Group Company (except for the Issuer), on the grounds mentioned in Clauses 12.1 (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), and (i) may only occur if the nature of the particular circumstance is such that it would have a Material Adverse Effect and that the cause of termination is continuing at the time of the Agent's declaration. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned in Clause 12.1 (d).
12.3 If the right to terminate the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law that the period of appeal has expired in order for cause of termination to be deemed to exist.
