8.2 If a Holder has registered, through an Account Operator, that principal Interest and any other payment that shall be made under these Terms and Conditions shall be deposited in a certain bank account; such deposits will be effected by the CSD on the relevant payment date. In other cases, payments will be transferred by the CSD to the Holder at the address registered with the CSD on the Record Date. Should the CSD, due to a delay on behalf of the Issuer or some other obstacle, not be able to effect
payments as aforesaid, the Issuer shall procure that such amounts are paid to the persons who are registered as Holders on the relevant Record Date as soon as possible after such obstacle has been removed.
8.3 If, due to any obstacle for the CSD, the Issuer cannot make a payment or repayment, such payment or repayment may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed. Interest shall accrue in accordance with Clause 9.4 during such postponement.
8.4 If payment or repayment is made in accordance with this Clause 8, the Issuer and the CSD shall be deemed to have fulfilled their obligations to pay, irrespective of whether such payment was made to a person not entitled to receive such amount.
8.5 The Issuer shall pay any stamp duty and other public fees accruing in connection with the Bond Issue or any Subsequent Bond Issue, but not in respect of trading in the secondary market (except to the extent required by applicable law), and shall not deduct at source any applicable withholding tax payable pursuant to law.
8.6 The Issuer is not liable to gross-up any payments under these Terms and Conditions by virtue of any withholding tax, public levy or the similar.
