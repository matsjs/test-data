A decision is made that any Material Group Company shall be demerged or merged into a company which is not a Group Company if such merger or demerger is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, provided that a merger involving the Issuer, where the Issuer is not the surviving entity, shall always be considered an Event of Default and provided that the Issuer may not be demerged.
Any expropriation, attachment, sequestration, distress or execution or any analogous process in any jurisdiction affects any asset or assets of any Material Group Company having an aggregate value of an amount equal to or exceeding SEK 15,000,000 and is not discharged within sixty (60) days.
16.8 Impossibility or Illegality
It is or becomes impossible or unlawful for the Issuer to fulfil or perform any of the provisions of the Finance Documents or if the obligations under any Finance Documents are not, or cease to be, legal, valid, binding and enforceable.
16.9 Continuation of the Business
The Issuer or any other Material Group Company ceases to carry on its business, except if due to (i) a merger or demerger permitted under 16.6 (Mergers and Demergers), or (ii) a disposal permitted under 15.6 (Disposal of Assets), if such discontinuation is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
16.10 Acceleration of the Bonds
(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Agent is entitled to, on behalf of the Bondholders (i) by notice to the Issuer, declare all, but not only some, of the Bonds due for payment together with any other amounts payable under the Finance Documents, immediately or at such later date as the Agent determines (but such date may not fall after the Final Maturity Date), and (ii) exercise any or all of its rights, remedies, powers and discretions under the Finance Documents.
(b) The Agent may not accelerate the Bonds in accordance with this Clause 16 by reference to a specific Event of Default if it is no longer continuing or if it has been decided, on a Bondholders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure, to waive such Event of Default (temporarily or permanently).
