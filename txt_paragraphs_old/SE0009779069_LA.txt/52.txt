A decision is made that any Group Company shall be demerged or merged if such merger or demerger is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, provided that a merger involving the Issuer, where the Issuer is not the surviving entity, shall always be considered an Event of Default and provided that the Issuer may not be demerged. For the avoidance of doubt, any merger or demerger permitted under these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute an Event of Default.
