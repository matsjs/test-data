(c) Failure to send a notice or other communication to a Bondholder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Bondholders.
24.2 Press releases
(a) Any notice that the Issuer or the Trustee shall send to the Bondholders pursuant to Clauses 9.3 (Voluntary total redemption (Call option)), 14.8 (Impossibility or Illegality, 11.1(a)(i), 16(o), 17(a), 18(a) and 19(c) shall also be published by way of press release by the Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable.
(b) In addition to Clause 24.2(a), if any information relating to the Bonds or the Group contained in a notice the Trustee may send to the Bondholders under these Terms and Conditions has not already been made public by way of a press release, the Trustee shall before it sends such information to the Bondholders give the Issuer the opportunity to issue a press release containing such information.
