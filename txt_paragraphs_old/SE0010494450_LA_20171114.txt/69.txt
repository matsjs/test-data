(h) Creditors' process: Any expropriation, attachment, sequestration, distress or execution or any analogous process in any jurisdiction affects any asset or assets of any Material Group Company having an aggregate value equal to or exceeding SEK 10,000,000 and is not discharged within thirty (30) calendar days;
(j) Continuation of the business: The Issuer or any other Material Group Company ceases to carry on its business, except if due to (i) a permitted merger or demerger as stipulated in 16.1 (g) above or (ii) a permitted disposal as stipulated in Clause 12.7 (Disposals o f assets).
16.2 Termination for payment prematurely on the grounds mentioned in Clause 16.1 (c) and (d) or, regarding any of the Subsidiaries, on the grounds mentioned in Clause 16.1 (e), (f), (g), (h) and (j) may only occur if the nature of the particular circumstance is such that it would have a Material Adverse Effect and that the cause of termination is continuing at the time of the Agent's declaration. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned under Clause 16.1 (e) above.
16.3 If the right to terminate the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the period of appeal has expired in order for cause of termination to be deemed to exist.
16.4 The Issuer is obliged to inform the Agent immediately if any circumstance of the type specified in Clause 16.1 should occur. Should the Agent not receive such information, the Agent is entitled to assume that no such circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Agent does not have knowledge of such circumstance. The Agent is under no obligations to make any investigations relating to the circumstances specified in Clause 16.1. The Issuer shall further, at the request of the Agent, provide the Agent with details of any circumstances referred to in Clause 16.1 and provide the Agent with all documents that may be of significance for the application of this Clause 16.
16.5 The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Agent according to Clause 16.4 if informing the Agent would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with Nasdaq Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable). If such a conflict would exist
