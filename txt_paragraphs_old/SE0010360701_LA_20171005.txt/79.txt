The Agent shall represent the Bondholders in accordance with the Finance Documents. The Agent is not responsible for the due execution, validity or enforceability of the Finance Documents.
The Agent's duties under the Finance Documents are solely mechanical and administrative in nature and the Agent only acts in accordance with the Finance Documents and upon instructions from the Bondholders, unless otherwise set out in the Finance Documents. In particular, the Agent is not acting as an advisor (whether legal, financial or otherwise) to the Bondholders or any other person and no opinion or advice by the Agent will be binding on the Bondholders.
The Agent is not obligated to assess or monitor the financial condition of the Issuer or compliance by the Group Companies with the terms of the Finance Documents (unless to the extent expressly set out in the Finance Documents) or to take any steps to ascertain whether any Event of Default (or any event that may lead to an Event of Default) has occurred.
The Agent is entitled to delegate its duties to other professional parties, but the Agent shall remain liable for the actions of such parties under the Finance Documents.
