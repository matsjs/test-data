The provisions of Clause 22.1 shall not in any way limit an individual Bondholder's right to claim and enforce payments which are due to it under Clause 9.6 (Mandatory repurchase due to a Change o f Control Event or a Listing Failure Event (put option)) or other payments which are due by the Issuer to some but not all Bondholders.
The right to receive repayment of the principal of the Bonds shall be prescribed and become void ten (10) years from the Redemption Date. The right to receive payment of Interest (excluding any capitalised Interest) shall be prescribed and become void three (3) years from the relevant due date for payment subject to the provisions of Clause 7 (Payments in respect o f the Bonds). The Issuer is entitled to any funds set aside for payments in respect of which the Bondholders' right to receive payment has been prescribed and has become void.
If a limitation period is duly interrupted in accordance with the Swedish Act on Limitations (Sw. preskriptionslag (1981:130)), a new limitation period of ten (10) years with respect to the right to receive repayment of the principal of the Bonds, and of three (3) years with respect to receive payment of Interest (excluding capitalised Interest) will commence, in both cases calculated from the date of interruption of the limitation period, as such date is determined pursuant to the provisions of the Swedish Act on Limitations.
