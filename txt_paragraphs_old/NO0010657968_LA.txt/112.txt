Consolidation, Amalgamation, Merger and de-merger
9.1 In the case of any consolidation, amalgamation or merger of Subsea with any other corporation (other than a consolidation, amalgamation or merger in which Subsea is the continuing corporation), or in the case of any sale or transfer of all, or substantially all, of the assets of Subsea, the Issuer will take such steps as shall be required by the Bond Trustee (including the execution of an agreement supplemental to or amending the Bond Agreement) to ensure that each Bond then outstanding will (during the period in which Exchange Rights may be exercised) be converted into the class and amount of shares and other securities and property receivable upon such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of Subsea Shares which would have become liable to be issued upon exercise of Exchange Rights immediately prior to such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer. Such supplemental agreement will provide for adjustments which will be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in Clause 4 (Adjustment of Exchange Price). The above will apply, mutatis mutandis to any subsequent consolidations, amalgamations, mergers, sales or transfers.
9.2 If Subsea decides on a merger in which Subsea is the acquiring company, and the shareholders of the acquired company receive settlement in the form of shares only, subject to confirmation from an Independent Financial Adviser that such is the case, no adjustment will be made to the Exchange Price. If the shareholders of the acquired company receive settlement in any other form, in full or partly, the Exchange Price shall be adjusted according to such provision of Clause 4 (Adjustment of Exchange Price) as an Independent Financial Adviser shall determine to be most appropriate.
9.3 The provisions in this Clause 9 (Merger and de-merger) have no limitation on the creditor's right of objection to statutory merger or de-merger (to the extent any such rights will apply in accordance with applicable law).
