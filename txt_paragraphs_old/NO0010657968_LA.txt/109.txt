Exchange Date in circumstances where the record date or other due date for the establishment of entitlement in respect of such Dividend or other entitlement shall be on or after the relevant Exchange Date and if on the Reference Date the Volume Weighted Average Price of a Subsea Shares is based on a price ex-Dividend or ex any other entitlement, then such price shall be increased by an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of such Dividend or entitlement per Subsea Share as at the date of first public announcement of such Dividend or entitlement.
4.14 If any doubt shall arise as to the appropriate adjustment to the Exchange Price, and following consultation between the Issuer and an Independent Financial Adviser, a written opinion of such Independent Financial Adviser in respect of such adjustment to the Exchange Price shall be conclusive and binding on all concerned, save in the case of manifest error.
4.15 No adjustment will be made to the Exchange Price where Subsea Shares or other Securities (including rights, warrants and options) are issued, offered, exercised, allotted, appropriated, modified or granted to, or for the benefit of, employees or former employees (including Directors holding or formerly holding executive office or the personal service company of any such person) or their spouses or relatives, in each case, of Subsea or any of its Subsidiaries or any associated company or to trustees to be held for the benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to any employees' share or option scheme.
4.16 On any adjustment, the resultant Exchange Price, if not an integral multiple of USD 0.01, shall be rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of USD 0.01. No adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Price where such adjustment (rounded down if applicable) would be less than one per cent, of the Exchange Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any amount by which the Exchange Price has been rounded down, shall be earned forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and such subsequent adjustment shall be made on the basis that the adjustment not required to be made had been made at the relevant time.
Notice of any adjustments to the Exchange Price shall be given by the Issuer to Bondholders in accordance with Clause 18.5 of the Bond Agreement and the Bond Trustee promptly after the determination thereof.
4.17 If the Issuer determines that an adjustment should be made to the Exchange Price as a result of one or more circumstances not referred to above in this Clause 4 (Adjustment of Exchange Price) (even if the relevant circumstance is specifically excluded from the operation of Clauses 4.1 to 4.10 above), the Issuer shall, at its own expense and acting reasonably, request an Independent Financial Adviser to determine as soon as practicable what adjustment (if any) to the Exchange Price is fair and reasonable to take account thereof and the date on which such adjustment should take effect and upon such determination such adjustment (if any) shall be made and shall take effect in accordance with such determination, provided that an adjustment shall only be made pursuant to this Clause 4.17 if such Independent Financial Adviser is so requested to make such a determination not more than 21 days after the date on which the relevant circumstance arises and if the adjustment would result in a reduction to the Exchange Price.
