All Bonds which are redeemed or in respect of which Exchange Rights are exercised will be cancelled and may not be reissued or resold. Subject to the requirements (if any) of any stock exchange on which the Bonds may be admitted to listing and trading at the relevant time and subject to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, Bonds purchased by the Issuer may be discharged and cancelled or re sold by the Issuer at the Issuer's discretion.
13.1 Provided that an Event of Default shall not have occurred and be continuing and provided that the number of Retained Subsea Shares shall thereafter be not less than 100 per cent, of the number of Subsea Shares that would be required to be delivered on exercise of Exchange Rights in respect of all outstanding Bonds (disregarding for this purpose any right of the Issuer to make a Cash Alternative Election in respect thereof) (the "Minimum Threshold"), the Issuer shall at any time be entitled to substitute Subsea Shares the subject of the Share Pledge Agreement and credited to the Siem VPS Account for an amount in cash in USD equal to the Fair Market Value of the number of Subsea Shares to be substituted as at the third dealing day prior to the date of the proposed substitution (the "Determination Date"), as determined by the Independent Financial Adviser and certified to the Bond Trustee by the Independent Financial Adviser (a "Permitted Substitution") provided that:
(a) the Fair Market Value, as at the Determination Date, of the number of Retained Subsea Shares immediately after such substitution (determined as provided above), translated, where appropriate, into USD at the Prevailing Rate on the Determination Date, together with any amounts standing to the credit of the Cash Account, shall be not less than the aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds on the Determination Date; and
(b) such cash amount is credited to the Cash Account prior to or simultaneously with the release of such Subsea Shares from the security constituted pursuant to the Share Pledge Agreement.
13.2 On any partial redemption or cancellation of Bonds, the Issuer shall be entitled to withdraw at any time thereafter from the Siem VPS Account the number of Subsea Shares which, expressed as a percentage of the Retained Subsea Shares, corresponds to the percentage which the partial redemption or cancellation forms of the total number of Bonds outstanding before such redemption or cancellation (a "Permitted Share Withdrawal").
13.3 In order to effect a Permitted Substitution or a Permitted Share Withdrawal as provided above, the Issuer shall give not more than 30 nor less than 15 days notice thereof to the Bondholders in accordance with Clause 18.5 of the Bond Agreement
