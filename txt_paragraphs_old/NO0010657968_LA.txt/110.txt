The Cash Alternative Election Notice shall specify whether the Cash Alternative Election is being made in respect of all the Subsea Shares that would otherwise be required to be delivered upon exercise of such Exchange Right or in respect of a lesser, specified number of Subsea Shares, and in the absence thereof the Cash Alternative Election shall be deemed to have been made in respect of all the Subsea Shares that otherwise would have been deliverable upon exercise of such Exchange Right.
5.2 If a Cash Alternative Election Notice shall specify that the Cash Alternative Election is being made in respect of less than all the Subsea Shares that would otherwise be required to be delivered upon exercise of the relevant Exchange Right (the "Original Number of Subsea Shares"), references to the number of Subsea Shares to be delivered on such exercise (or the like) shall be construed as a reference to the Original Number of Subsea Shares less the number of Subsea Shares specified in the relevant Cash Alternative Election Notice.
