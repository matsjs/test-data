4.11 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment pursuant to this Clause 4 (Adjustment of Exchange Price) have already resulted or will result in an adjustment to the Exchange Price or where the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment arise by virtue of any other events or circumstances which have already given or will give rise to an adjustment to the Exchange Price or where more than one event which gives rise to an adjustment to the Exchange Price occurs within such a short period of time that, in the opinion of the Issuer, a modification to the operation of the adjustment provisions is required to give the intended result, such modification shall be made to the operation of the adjustment provisions as may be advised by an Independent Financial Adviser to be in its opinion appropriate to give the intended result and provided further that, for the avoidance of doubt, the issue of Subsea Shares pursuant to the exercise of Exchange Rights shall not result in an adjustment to the Exchange Price.
