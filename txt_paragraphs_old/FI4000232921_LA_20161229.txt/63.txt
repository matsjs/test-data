There may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining Securi ty from all Material Group Companies in jurisdictions (other than Fin land) in which Material Group Companies are domiciled. The security and extent of its perfection will be determined by the Issuer in coopera tion with the Financial Advisor to the Issuer taking into account the cost to the Group of providing Security so as to ensure that it is proportion ate to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties.
The Issuer shall not (and the Issuer shall ensure that no member of the Group will) directly or, to the best of its knowledge and belief, indirectly, contribute or otherwise make available the proceeds of any Bond Issue to any person or enti ty (whether or not related to any member of the Group) for the purpose of fi nancing the activities of any person or entity which, at the time of such financ ing, is listed on any Sanctions List or which is otherwise a designated target of the Sanctions or using the proceeds for the purposes of carrying out business operations that are subject to Sanctions, to the extent such contribution or pro vision would result in the Issuer or any member of the Group being in a breach of any Sanctions applicable to the Issuer or such member of the Group.
Sanctions means:
(a) United Nations sanctions imposed pursuant to any United Nations Se curity Council Resolution;
(b) U.S. sanctions or trade embargoes imposed, administered or enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S Department of Treas ury (OFAC);
