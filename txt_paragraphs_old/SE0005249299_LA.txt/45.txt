Such notice may be given in advance of the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, conditioned upon the occurrence of such Change of Control Event, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for a Change of Control Event; and
The Issuer shall notify the Trustee of any transaction referred to in Clause 10.3 and shall, upon request by the Trustee, provide the Trustee with (i) any information relating to the transaction which the Trustee deems necessary (acting reasonably), and (ii) a determination from the Issuer which states whether the transaction is carried out on an arm's length basis and on terms and conditions customary for such transaction or not and whether it has a Material Adverse Effect or not.
