13.2 Calculation Adjustments
(a) The calculation of the ratio of Net Interest Bearing Debt to EBITDA shall be made as per a testing date determined by the Issuer, falling no more than one month prior to the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness or a distribution in accordance with Clause 14.2(b). The Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date so determined, but include the new Financial Indebtedness provided it is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Interest Bearing Debt).
(b) The calculation of the Interest Coverage Ratio shall be made for the Relevant Period ending on the last day of the period covered by the most recent Financial Report.
(c) The figures for EBITDA and the Net Finance Charges for the Relevant Period ending on the last day of the period covered by the most recent Financial Report shall be used for the Incurrence Test, but adjusted so that:
(i) entities acquired or disposed of by the Group during the Relevant Period, or after the end of the Relevant Period but before the relevant testing date, shall be included or excluded (as applicable), pro forma, for the entire Relevant Period;
(ii) any entity to be acquired with the proceeds from new Financial Indebtedness shall be included, pro forma, for the entire Relevant Period; and
(iii) the pro forma calculation of EBITDA shall be adjusted to take into account the net cost savings and other reasonable synergies, as the case may be, realisable for the Group during the Relevant Period as a result of acquisitions and/or disposals of entities referred to in (i) and (ii) above, provided that such net cost savings and other reasonable synergies, as the case may be, may only be accounted for if confirmed by a reputable accounting firm and the Issuer has provided evidence thereof to the Agent and only up to an aggregate maximum amount of 10% of EBITDA.
