8.1.2
APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF THE AGENT
Appointment of Agent
By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder appoints the Agent to act as its agent in all matters relating to the Notes and the Finance Documents, and authorises the Agent to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Notes held by such Noteholder. By acquiring Notes, each subsequent Noteholder confirms such appointment and authorisation for the Agent to act on its behalf.
Each Noteholder shall immediately upon request provide the Agent with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent), that the Agent deems necessary or desirable for the purpose of carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents. The Agent is under no obligation to represent a Noteholder which does not comply with such request.
No Noteholder may take any actions whatsoever on its own against the Issuer in matters relating to the Notes or the Finance Documents, unless the Agent has been instructed by the Noteholders to take certain actions against the Issuer but refrains from taking, or is unable to take, such actions within reasonable time.
For so long as any Note is outstanding, the Agent shall act with regard only to the interests of the Noteholders and shall not be required to have regard to the interests or to act upon or comply with any direction or request of any other person, other than as explicitly stated in the Finance Documents.
