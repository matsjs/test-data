Where the Issuer shall pursuant to Clause 11.4(g) use proceeds from a sale of assets to partially redeem the Notes outstanding (pro rata for both Fixed Rate Notes and Floating Rate Notes, the percentage redeemed being the "Redeemed Percentage"), such redemption shall occur on an Interest Payment Date for the Floating Rate Notes occurring no later than three (3) months after the expiry of the period available for reinvestment. The redemption price per Note shall be (A) 101 per cent, of the Nominal Amount multiplied with the Redeemed Percentage (rounded down to the nearest SEK 1,000) plus (B) accrued but unpaid Interest on the Redeemed Percentage of the Nominal Amount.
The Issuer may redeem all outstanding Notes at a price per Note equal to the Nominal Amount plus accrued but unpaid Interest on a date determined by the Issuer if it is or becomes unlawful for the Issuer to perform its obligations under the Finance Documents.
Mandatory repurchase due to a Change of Control Event
Upon a Change of Control Event occurring, each Noteholder shall have the right to request that all, or some of, its Notes be repurchased by the Issuer, at a price per Note equal to 101 per cent, of the Nominal Amount (plus accrued but unpaid Interest), during a period of twenty (20) Business Days following a notice from the Issuer of the Change of Control Event pursuant to Clause 10.1 (c) (after which time period such rights lapse). If a Noteholder has so requested, the Issuer shall repurchase the relevant Notes within forty (40) Business Days from the end of such period. The Notes repurchased by the Issuer may at the Issuer's discretion be retained, sold or cancelled by the Issuer.
