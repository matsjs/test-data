The Agent shall have no liability for damage caused by the Agent acting in accordance with instructions of the Noteholders given in accordance with Clause 13 (Noteholders ' Consent), or in accordance with advice from or opinions of external experts engaged by the Agent, provided that the Agent has acted with reasonable care. However, any compensation received by the Agent for damages caused by external experts of the Agent shall be distributed in accordance with Clause 12.5.
If in the Agent's reasonable opinion the cost, loss or liability which it may incur in complying with instructions of the Noteholders will not be covered by an expected distribution of proceeds in accordance with Clause 12.5, the Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with such instructions until it has received such indemnities (or adequate Security has been provided therefore) as it may reasonably require, save that the Agent shall always notify the Noteholders about an Event of Default in accordance with Clause 12.4.
Limited liability for the Agent
The Agent will not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it under or in connection with any Finance Document, unless directly caused by its gross negligence or wilful misconduct.
The Agent shall not be liable for any delay (or any related consequences) in crediting an account with an amount required pursuant to the Finance Documents to be paid by the Agent provided that the Agent has taken all necessary steps as soon as reasonably practicable to comply with the regulations or operating procedures of any recognised clearing or settlement system used by the Agent for that purpose.
