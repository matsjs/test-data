falling no more than one month prior to the disposal (for the avoidance of doubt, any cash balance resulting from the disposal shall not reduce the Net Debt); or
(g) not permitted by paragraphs (a) to (f) above, where the cash consideration (after deducting reasonable expenses incurred by any Group Company with respect to such disposals and any amount of any tax incurred or required to be paid by the seller as a result of such disposals (as reasonably determined by the seller on the basis of existing rates and taking into account any available tax deductions or allowances)) that in aggregate exceeds SEK 500,000,000 per calendar year (i) is used for reinvestment in any other assets (excluding only cash and cash-equivalent investments) within 365 days, (ii) is equal to or less than the aggregate amount used by the Group Companies for investments in any assets (excluding only cash and cash-equivalent investments) during the 365 days preceding such disposal, or (iii) is used to make a partial redemption of the Notes in accordance with Clause 9.4 (Partial redemption as a result o f a disposal o fassets), provided that there shall be no double counting between items (i) and (ii).
Financial Indebtedness
The Issuer shall not incur any new Financial Indebtedness (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the issuance of any Subsequent Notes and guarantees for Financial Indebtedness owed by other Group Companies) unless the Net Leverage Ratio tested pro forma including such incurrence is below 2.3:1, calculated as per a testing date falling no more than one month prior to the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness. For the purpose of calculating the Net Leverage Ratio, the figures for EBITDA set out in the latest financial statements published pursuant to Clause 10.1 (a) or (b) (including, when necessary, financial statements published before the First Issue Date) shall be used, but adjusted so that entities acquired or disposed after the end of the measurement period but before the relevant testing date will be included or excluded (as applicable) for the entire measurement period, and the amount of Net Debt shall be measured on the relevant testing date but include the new Financial Indebtedness (for the avoidance of doubt, the new Financial Indebtedness shall increase the Net Debt but any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce the Net Debt).
Any new Debt Instruments permitted to be issued or guaranteed pursuant to Clause 11.5.1 may not mature prior to the Final Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the above, any new Debt Instrument permitted to be guaranteed by the Issuer pursuant to Clause 11.5.1 and being issued by a Group Company may mature prior to the Final Maturity Date provided that such Debt Instrument is not denominated in Swedish Kronor and is not quoted, listed or otherwise traded on the same Regulated Market as the Notes.
The Issuer shall procure that no other Group Company will incur or allow to subsist any Financial Indebtedness if and to the extent that such Financial Indebtedness would cause or result in a Net Leverage Ratio of 2.0:1 or more, excluding in this calculation all interest
