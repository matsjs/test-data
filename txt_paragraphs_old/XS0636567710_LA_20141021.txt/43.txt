(5) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an opinion of counsel, subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.
Amendment, Supplement and Waiver
Except as provided otherwise in the succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes and any Note Guarantee may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes); provided that, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect one series of the Notes, only the consent of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required.
Unless (i) consented to by the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Notes or (ii) consented to by each holder of Notes adversely affected thereby (in each case including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), an amendment, supplement or waiver may not:
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described above under the caption "--Repurchase at the Option of Holders");
(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Note;
(4) impair the right of any holder of Notes to receive payment of principal of and interest on such holder's Notes on or after the due dates therefore or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder's Notes or any Guarantee in respect thereof;
