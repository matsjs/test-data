150
second paragraph under ``--Certain Covenants--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" or (ii) the discharge on the Calculation Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge was made using the proceeds of Indebtedness incurred pursuant to one or more of the categories of ``Permitted Debt" set forth in the second paragraph under ``--Certain Covenants--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock".
In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio:
(1) acquisitions that have been made by the specified Person or any of its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, including through mergers or consolidations, or any Person or any of its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries acquired by the specified Person or any of its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, and including all related financing transactions and including increases in ownership of Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to the Calculation Date, or that are to be made on the Calculation Date, will be given pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer and may include anticipated expense and cost reduction synergies) as if they had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period;
(2) the Consolidated EBITDA attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations or businesses (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded;
(3) the Fixed Charges attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations or businesses (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded, but only to the extent that the obligations giving rise to such Fixed Charges will not be obligations of the specified Person or any of its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;
