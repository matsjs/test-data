to overcome the relevant legal prohibition precluding the giving of the Note Guarantee and will procure that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary undertakes all whitewash or similar procedures which are legally available to eliminate the relevant limit, and shall give such Note Guarantee at such time (and to the extent) that it thereafter becomes permissible). Upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indentures, such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Note Guarantee created pursuant to the provisions described in the first paragraph of this covenant shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (a) (i) such Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary (including as a result of any sale, exchange or transfer (including by way of merger or consolidation), to any Person, of all of the Issuer's Capital Stock in such Restricted Subsidiary) or (ii) a sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary, in each case (i) and (ii) in compliance with the covenant described under "Repurchase at the Option of the Holders--Assets Sales" (including the requirements relating to the application of proceeds) and otherwise in compliance with the Indenture or (b) the release by the holders of the Indebtedness of the Issuer described in the second preceding paragraph of their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness) (but not under the relevant guarantee)), at a time when (i) no other Indebtedness of the Issuer that is Public Debt has been guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary; or (ii) the holders of all such other Indebtedness that is Public Debt which is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary also release their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness (but not under the relevant guarantee)) and, in each such case, such Restricted Subsidiary is not obligated in respect of any Indebtedness incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary under the provisions described in the last sentence of the first paragraph under the caption "--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock."
If and so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of the release of or the granting of such Note Guarantee in Luxembourg in the manner described below, at the offices of the Paying Agent or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such reports on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries
The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption ``--Restricted Payments" or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Issuer may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer's Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption "--Restricted Payments". If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption "--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock", the Issuer will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption ``--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock", calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the
