Transactions with Affiliates
(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and
(2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee:
(a) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of 7.5 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer set forth in an Officer's Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with this covenant and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer (or, in the event there is only one such disinterested member, by such disinterested member); and, in addition,
(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of 15.0 million, an opinion of an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of international standing, or other recognized independent expert of international standing with experience appraising the terms and conditions of the type of transaction or series of related transactions for which an opinion is required, stating that the transaction or series of related transactions is (i) fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate.
The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:
(1) any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement, consultant, employee benefit arrangements with any employee, consultant, officer or director of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, including under any stock option, stock appreciation rights, stock incentive or similar plans, entered into in the ordinary course of business;
(2) transactions between or among the Issuer and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries;
(3) transactions with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Issuer) that is an Affiliate of the Issuer solely because the Issuer owns, directly or through a Restricted Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person;
