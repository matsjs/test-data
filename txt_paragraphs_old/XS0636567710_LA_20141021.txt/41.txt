The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding may, on behalf of the holders of all outstanding Notes, waive any past default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of premium, if any, any Additional Amounts or interest on any Note held by a non-consenting holder (which may only be waived with the consent of each holder of Notes affected).
No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders
No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any of their shareholders or Affiliates, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under applicable securities laws.
Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
The Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officer's Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes and all obligations of any Guarantors discharged with respect to their Note Guarantees ("Legal Defeasance'') except for:
(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts) or premium, if any, on, such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;
(2) the Issuer's obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;
(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer's and the Guarantors' obligations in connection therewith; and
(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.
