Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock
The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the Issuer will not and will not permit the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to, issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however, that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock and the Restricted Subsidiaries may issue preferred stock, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or such preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or the preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors may not incur Indebtedness pursuant to this paragraph if, after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or issuance (including pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors incurred or issued pursuant to this paragraph would exceed 50% of the Issuer's and the Restricted Subsidiaries' Indebtedness determined on a consolidated basis.
The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, "Permitted Debt''):
(1) the incurrence by the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness under Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) not to exceed 175.0 million, plus in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing, less the aggregate amount of all Net Proceeds of Asset Sales applied by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue Date to repay any Indebtedness under Credit Facilities and effect a corresponding commitment reduction thereunder pursuant to the covenant described above under the caption "--Repurchase at the Option of the Holders--Asset Sales";
(2) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue Date after giving effect to the use of proceeds of the Notes;
(3) the incurrence by the Issuer of Indebtedness represented by the Notes issued on the Issue Date and any future Note Guarantees;
(4) Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or preferred stock of any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, representing Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase money obligations incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price, lease expense, rental payments or cost of design, construction, installation or
