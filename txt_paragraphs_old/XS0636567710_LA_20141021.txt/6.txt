(4) any Taxes withheld, deducted, imposed or levied on a payment to an individual that are required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive;
(6) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments made under, or with respect to, the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;
(7) any Taxes imposed, levied or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of Notes to comply with any written request of the Issuer (made at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request) to satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;
(8) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer or relevant Guarantor to the holder if such holder is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had such holder been the sole beneficial owner of such Note; or
(9) any combination of items (1) through (8) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the holder of Notes for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise or property Taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties and interest related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction (or any jurisdiction if such Taxes are required to be paid in connection with the enforcement of the Notes, the Indenture or any other document referred to therein following the occurence of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes) on the execution, delivery, issuance, or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein, or the enforcement of any of the Notes.
If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, each of, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 day prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer's Certificate(s) must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. Upon request, copies of Tax receipts or other evidence of payments, as the case may be, will be made available by the Trustee to the Holders or beneficial owners of the Notes.
