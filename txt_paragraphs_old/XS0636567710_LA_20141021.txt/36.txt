Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer's Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption "--Restricted Payments". If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption "--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock", the Issuer will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption ``--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock", calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
Maintenance of Listing
The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on another "recognised stock exchange'' as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom.
