Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries
(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;
(2) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or
(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
provided that (x) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill period to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.
However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:
(1) agreements governing Indebtedness and Credit Facilities as in effect on the Issue Date and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the Issue Date;
(2) the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees;
(3) agreements governing other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described above under the caption ``--Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the restrictions therein are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes than is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);
