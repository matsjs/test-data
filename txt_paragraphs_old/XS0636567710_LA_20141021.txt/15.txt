If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the Registrar, as appropriate, will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under "--Book-Entry, Delivery and Form", based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. The Trustee and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.
For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Notes shall also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.
