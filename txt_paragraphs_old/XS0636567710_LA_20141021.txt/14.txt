(5) to repurchase, prepay, redeem or repay any Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary that is not Subordinated Indebtedness; provided, however, that in connection with any repayment, prepayment, redemption or purchase of Debt pursuant to this clause (5), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and if the Indebtedness repaid, prepaid, redeemed or purchased is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; or
Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.
Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant will constitute "Excess Proceeds." When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds 15.0 million, within ten Business Days thereof, the Issuer will make an offer (an "Asset Sale Offer") to all holders of Notes and may make an offer to all holders of other Indebtedness that ispari passu with the Notes to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price for the Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
122
the relevant interest payment date, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into (or to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds or if the aggregate amount of Notes tendered pursuant to a Notes Offer exceeds the amount of the Net Proceeds so applied, the Trustee will select the Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness, if applicable, to be purchased on a pro rata basis (or in the manner described under "--Selection and Notice"), based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.
The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, an Asset Sale Offer or a Notes Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control, Asset Sale or Notes Offer provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control, Asset Sale or Notes Offer provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
Selection and Notice
If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the Registrar, as appropriate, will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under "--Book-Entry, Delivery and Form", based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. The Trustee and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.
No Notes shall be redeemed in part if the resulting Note would have a minimum denomination that is less than 100,000. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.
