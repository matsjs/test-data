Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note, or the ``Restricted Book-Entry Interest'', may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note, as applicable, or the ``Reg S Book-Entry Interests'', only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.
If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of 100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the applicable Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under ``Notice to Investors''.
Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of 100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions and pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive Registered Notes:
(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;
(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;
(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or
