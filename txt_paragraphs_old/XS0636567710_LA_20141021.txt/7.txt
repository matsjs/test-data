If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, each of, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 day prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer's Certificate(s) must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
Whenever in the Indenture, the Notes, or in this "Description of the Notes'' there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment on the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.

(1) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the Indenture (excluding Notes held by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and
(2) the redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.
