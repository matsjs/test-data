(12) Indebtedness represented by Guarantees of any Management Advances;
(14) Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Issuer and Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate outstanding principal amount or liquidation preference which, when taken together with any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount and liquidation preference of all other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and preferred stock incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, will not exceed 50% of the net cash proceeds received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or from the net cash proceeds of cash contributions made to the common equity capital of the Issuer, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however, that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries have not made a Restricted Payment under clause (c)(ii) of the first paragraph or under the second paragraph of the covenant described under the caption "Restricted Payments" in reliance thereon;
(15) Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary providing for customary indemnification, obligations in respect of earnouts or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar obligations, in each case, incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business or assets or Person or any Equity Interests of a Subsidiary, provided that the maximum liability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the Fair Market Value of non-cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition;

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Note Guarantee on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment-ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities.
For purposes of determining compliance with this "Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (17) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, from time to time to reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant. Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt.

The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock or the requalification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness as of the Issue Date (including, without limitation, capital leases) due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred; provided, however, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated in non-euro currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement with respect to euro the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the euro-equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the euro-equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally incurred, except that to the extent that:
