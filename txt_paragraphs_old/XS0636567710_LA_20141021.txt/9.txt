(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of this Luxembourg listing memorandum (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of this Luxembourg listing memorandum, such later date); or
In the case of Additional Amounts required to be paid as a result of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor conducting business other than in the place of its organization, such amendment or change must be announced and become effective on or after the date in which the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, begins to conduct business giving rise to the relevant withholding or deduction.
The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantees were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that there has been such amendment or change which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it.
119
The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.
The foreging provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.
For the avoidance of doubt, the implementation of European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive will not be a change or amendment for such purposes.
Mandatory Redemption
The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
