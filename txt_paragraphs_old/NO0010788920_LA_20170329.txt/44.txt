EXECUTION VERSION
(c) The Pre-Settlement Security shall be established no later than two (2) days before the Issue Date. The Pre-Disbursement Security shall be established prior to or in connection with the release of funds from the Escrow Account and the Bond Escrow Account, at which time the Bond Trustee shall have the right (acting in its sole discretion) to release the Pre-Settlement Security. The Pre-Disbursement Security (Tap Issues) shall be established prior to or in connection with the release of funds to the Issuer in connection with such Tap Issue.
(d) All security interests established under any of the Security Documents shall, subject to limitations usually applied under the relevant laws governing any such Security Document, secure all of the Issuer's and any Guarantor's obligations and liabilities under the Finance Documents. For the avoidance of doubt, no guarantee will be issued and no security interest will be created in respect of any assets held by any Restricted Company or any other company which is not an Operating Company.
(e) The Issuer (and when relevant, the Bond Trustee) shall procure that any and all security interests established under or in connection with the Existing Bonds are released as soon as reasonably and practically possible following the earlier of the Issuer having:
(i) deposited on a defeasance pledge account (pledged and blocked) a sufficient amount for the full repayment of any Existing Bonds (including call premium and accrued interest); and
(ii) redeemed the Existing Bonds in full (together with any call premium and accrued interest),
however, the Issuer shall following the Bond Trustee's release of the Existing Security have a clean-up period of no less than sixty (60) days in which to discharge and release all security currently granted for Existing Bonds. The Transaction Security shall, to the extent relevant, rank junior to the Existing Security until such security have been released and discharged in full, after which such Transaction Security shall, where legally possible, have first priority.
