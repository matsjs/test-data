Subsidiaries' distributions
Save for obligations under any Financial Indebtedness, the Parent shall not permit any Subsidiary (other than a member of the FPSO Group) to create or permit to exist any contractual obligation (or encumbrance) restricting the right of any Subsidiary to:
(a) pay dividends or make other distributions to its shareholders;
(b) service any Financial Indebtedness to the Issuer;
(c) make any loans to the Issuer; or
(d) transfer any of its assets and properties to the Issuer;
