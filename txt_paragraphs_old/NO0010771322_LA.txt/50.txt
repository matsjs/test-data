(a) Any notice that the Issuer or the Trustee shall send to the Bondholders pursuant to Clauses 11.3 (Voluntary total redemption (call option)), 11.4 (Mandatory repurchase due to a Change of Control Event (put option)), 12.1(a), 12.1(b), 14.10(c), 16(q), 17(a), 18(a) and 19(b) shall also be published by way of press release by the Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable.
(b) In addition to Paragraph (a) above, if any information relating to the Bonds or the Group contained in a notice the Trustee may send to the Bondholders under these Terms and Conditions has not already been made public by way of a press release, the Trustee shall before it sends such information to the Bondholders give the Issuer the opportunity to issue a press release containing such information. If the Issuer does not promptly issue a press release and the Trustee considers it necessary to issue a press release containing such information before it can lawfully send a notice containing such information to the Bondholders, the Trustee shall be entitled to issue such press release.
