The Security Agent may at any time, acting on instructions of the Secured Creditors, release any Shared Security in accordance with the terms of the Shared Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any Shared Security will always be released pro rata between the Secured Creditors and the
remaining Shared Security will continue to rank pari passu between the Secured Creditors as set forth in the Shared Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement.
11.3 Enforcement of Shared Security
(a) The Security Agent may only take action to accelerate or enforce any Shared Security in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement contains, inter alia, a stand-still provision (binding upon the Secured Creditors) relating to the enforcement of the Shared Security and a right for the Senior Lender to initially give enforcement instructions with respect to the Shared Security.
(b) Upon an enforcement of the Shared Security, the proceeds shall be distributed in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.
(c) All Shared Security or arrangement having similar effects may be released by the Security Agent, without the need for any further referral to or authority from anyone, upon any enforcement provided that the proceeds are distributed in accordance with the provisions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.
12. Bond Only Security
12.1 Granting of the Bond Only Security
(a) As continuing Security for the due and punctual fulfilment of the Secured Bond Obligations, the Issuer will, in accordance with Clauses 4(b) and 4(e), grant the Bond Only Security to the Bondholders as represented by the Bonds Agent on the terms set out in the Bond Security Documents.
