STATUS OF THE BONDS AND SECURITY
The Bonds shall constitute senior debt obligations of the Issuer. The Bonds shall rank at
least pari passu with all other obligations of the Issuer (save for such claims which are
preferred by bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or other similar laws of general
application) and shall rank ahead of subordinated debt.
8.2 Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement (i) any proceeds received by the Existing Bond Trustee from the realisation of secured assets under the existing security granted in connection with the Existing Bonds; (ii) any other proceeds realised in respect of the Existing Bonds; and (iii) any proceeds of the Bonds held by the Existing Bond Trustee from time to time and not otherwise reasonably required by the Existing Bond Trustee to meet liabilities incurred in connection with the Purpose, shall be applied first to meet the fees, costs and expenses of the Existing Bond Trustee and the Bond Trustee pro rata as between them and thereafter (subject always to Clause 8.3) in repayment of amounts outstanding under the Bonds so that all Bonds and outstanding amounts under the Bonds shall be redeemed in full prior to any payments being made to the Existing Bondholders under the Existing Bond Agreement (the "Turnover").
8.3 The Turnover mechanism will apply only to the first tranche of the Bonds unless an Existing Bondholder resolution and an amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement are implemented so that the Turnover mechanism shall apply to any new Bonds issued pursuant to a Tap Issue after the Issue Date.
8.4 The Bonds are unsecured. If the Issuer or its Subsidiary acquires either (i) the shares in the Owner or (ii) the Vessel, the Issuer or its Subsidiary (as applicable) shall, if required by the Bond Trustee (acting on instructions of the Bondholders), grant Security in the form of (i) a share pledge of the shares in the Owner; (ii) a mortgage over the Vessel; (iii) an assignment
