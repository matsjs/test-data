By acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Holder confirms such appointment and authorisation for the Agent to act on its behalf.
Each Holder shall immediately upon request by the Agent provide the Agent with any such documents, including a written power o f attorney (in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent), as the Agent deems necessary for the purpose o f exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under these Terms and Conditions.
