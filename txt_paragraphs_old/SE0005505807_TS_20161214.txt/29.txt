If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it on its due date, default interest shall
accrue on the overdue amount from (but excluding) the due date up to (and including) the
date of actual payment at a rate which is two (2) per cent, higher than the Interest Rate.
Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the
failure to pay was solely attributable to the Agent or the CSD, in which case the Interest
Rate shall apply instead.
