The Issuer may in connection with the sale or disposal of a Subsidiary, or following the sale or disposal of all or substantially all of a Subsidiary's assets, redeem in whole or in part all outstanding Notes by way of reducing the Nominal Amount of each Note pro rata (rounded down to the nearest SEK 1,000). The partial redemption must be made with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Disposal Proceeds. For the avoidance of doubt a partial redemption shall not occur where the amount to be repaid pro rata per Note is less than SEK 1,000. The redemption price per Note shall be 101 per cent, of the Nominal Amount plus accrued by unpaid interest on the redeemed amount.
Early redemption due to illegality (call option)
The Issuer may redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Notes at an amount per Note equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest on a date determined by the Issuer if it is or becomes unlawful for the Issuer to perform its obligations under the Finance Documents.
The Issuer shall give notice of any redemption pursuant to Clause 9.5.1 no later than twenty (20) Business Days after having received actual knowledge of any event specified therein (after which time period such right shall lapse).
A notice of redemption in accordance with Clause 9.5.1 is irrevocable and, on the date specified in such notice, the Issuer is bound to redeem the Notes in full at the applicable amounts.
Mandatory repurchase due to a Change of Control Event (put option)
Upon a Change of Control Event occurring, each Noteholder shall have the right to request that all, or some only, of its Notes be repurchased at a price per Note equal to 101 per cent, of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest, during a period of twenty (20) Business Days following a notice from the Issuer of the Change of Control
