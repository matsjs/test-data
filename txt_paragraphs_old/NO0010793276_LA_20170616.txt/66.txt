(i) maintain 100% direct ownership of the Rig except as set out in Clause 13.8(b) (Rig Transfer), or otherwise as approved by the Bond Trustee or, where necessary, the Bondholders' Meeting; and
(m) Dividends
The Issuer shall not declare or make any dividend payment or distribution, whether in cash or in kind, repurchase of shares or make other similar transactions (included, but not limited to total return swaps related to shares in the Issuer), or other distributions or transactions implying a transfer of value to its shareholders other than if the Asset Cover Ratio immediately subsequent to such transactions is equal to or higher than 167% and remaining Charter backlog (excluding options) is above 12 months. Any such dividend payment or distribution may not exceed 50% of the Issuer's consolidated net profit after taxes based on the audited annual accounts for the previous financial year. Any un-utilized portion of the permitted dividend pursuant to the above may not be carried forward to any subsequent financial year.

The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that no Subsidiary shall:
(i) incur or permit to remain outstanding any Financial Indebtedness (whether secured or unsecured) other than the Permitted Financial Indebtedness; or
(ii) grant any financial support such as loans, guarantees or other financial assistance to any party, except for (A) guarantees issued for the benefit of third parties in the ordinary course of business, (B) any financial support contemplated by this Bond Agreement and (C) any Intercompany Loans.
