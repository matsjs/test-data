(a) Surplus Volume means the volume of cumulative sales gas produced at the end of a Semiannual Period in excess of the Accumulated Production Threshold, less the sum of any Surplus Volumes produced in previous Semiannual Periods and paid out as Surplus Amount (provided such Surplus Volume is always a positive number), calculated as follows:
(b) AGP ~ Accumulated Gross Production from the Breagh Field (in Bcf) since the start-up of commercial operations (the "Accumulated Gross Production");
(c) EAGP = Expected Accumulated Gross Production from the Breagh Field (in Bcf) derived from the RPS 2P reserves report dated 4 April 2013, reflecting a First production date of August 2013;
(d) EAGP*110% = Accumulated Production Thresholds (Bcf) (as set out in the tables under definition of Accumulated Production Thresholds), representing an increase of 10% to the EAGP (the "Accumulated Production Thresholds"):
(e) Price = the production-weighted average realized gas price throughout the relevant Semiannual Period in USD/Mcf calculated on the basis of the weighted average USD/GBP exchange rate (with such realized gas price reflecting net revenues as evidenced by the relevant invoices, billing statements or reconciliation statements prepared by or agreed with the purchaser(s) of the Issuer's gas produced from the Breagh Field) throughout the relevant Semiannual Period;
(0
Opex = USD 1,5/Mcf, being approximately the average unit opex cost
(including Gemini entitlement) over the period 2014-2019 as derived from
RPS' cash flow tables for the Breagh Development Phase J and the Breagh
