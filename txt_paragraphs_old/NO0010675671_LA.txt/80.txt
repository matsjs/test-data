the Cladhan Licence to TAQA:
(iii) if the Cladhan Financing Condition is not met by 30 June 2013 a further 18.8% interest will be transferred. The Cladhan SPA 2 provides inter alia that an 11.8% interest will be re-conveyed to the Issuer, once certain costs expended by TAQA in respect of that 11.8% interest have been reimbursed to TAQA, plus an agreed uplift, from the share of production which relates to such 11.8% interest.
5.3.3 Completion of the relevant transfer(s) (of up to 24.4% of the interest in the Cladhan Licence) will occur (in a single transaction) after 30 June 2013. If the circumstances in Clause 8.3.2 (iii) above apply, there is a provision for the reconveyance of 11.8% to the Issuer as described in Clause 8.3.2 (iii).
8.3.4 Provided that the arrangement under the Cladhan TAQA Finance Agreements is not cancelled, in accordance with the covenant set out in Clause 13.4 (1) (Special Covenants), the Issuer shall ensure that a first priority English law assignment by way of security and/or a fixed charge over the Cladhan Assets ("Cladhan Security") shall be established as follows:
(a) Cladhan Security shall be granted over 2% of the Issuer's interest in the Cladhan Assets promptly following the transfer of the 24.4% interest to TAQA after 30 June 2013: and
(b) additional Cladhan Security shall be granted over 11,8% of the Issuer's interest in the Cladhan Assets promptly after the reconveyance of the 11.8% interest to the Issuer, should that occur,
and the Issuer shall execute or procure the execution of all such documents and perform all acts which may be necessary to ensure that such security over the Cladhan Assets is duly created, enforceable and perfected as a first priority security in favour of the Bond Trustee, subject to and in accordance with Clause 8.1, and shall in this respect also procure delivery to the Bond Trustee of relevant documents similar to those provided pursuant to Clauses 6.2.1(d) (if appropriate), 6.2.1(e), 6.2.1(f). 6.2.1(h), 6.2,1 (n) and 6.2. l(o), all at the expense of the Issuer or the relative security provider (as the case may be).
