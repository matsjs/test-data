However, if the failure to take certain actions is caused by the non-payment by the Issuer of any fee or indemnity due to the Agent under the Finance Documents or by any reason described in Clause 18.2(h), such failure must continue for at least forty (40) Business Days after notice pursuant to Clause 18.2(i) before a Bondholder may take any action referred to in Clause 21(a).
