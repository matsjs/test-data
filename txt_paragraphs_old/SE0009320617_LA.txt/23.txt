(b) Interest accrues during an Interest Period. Payment of Interest in respect of the Bonds shall be made to the Bondholders on each Interest Payment Date for the preceding Interest Period.
(d) If the Issuer fails to pay any amount payable by it under these Terms and Conditions on its due date, default interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from (but excluding) the due date up to (and including) the date of actual payment at a rate which is two hundred (200) basis points higher than the Interest Rate. Accrued default interest shall not be capitalised. No default interest shall accrue where the failure to pay was solely attributable to the Agent or the CSD, in which case the Interest Rate shall apply instead.
8. Redemption and Repurchase of the Bonds
8.1 Redemption at maturity
The Issuer shall redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Bonds in full on the Final Maturity Date with an amount per Bond equal to the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest. If the Final Maturity Date is not a Business Day, then the redemption shall occur on the first following Business Day.
8.2 Issuer's purchase of Bonds
(a) The Issuer may, subject to applicable law, at any time and at any price purchase Bonds on the market or in any other way. The Bonds held by the Issuer may at the Issuer's discretion be retained or sold by the Issuer, however, provided that no Bonds may be cancelled by the Issuer.
(b) Notwithstanding Clause 8.2(a) above, Bonds held by the Issuer may be cancelled (i) in connection with a full redemption of the Bonds in order to cater for such full redemption of the Bonds, and (ii) if the Issuer has purchased all Bonds and the Issuer cancels all, but not some only, of the Bonds.
