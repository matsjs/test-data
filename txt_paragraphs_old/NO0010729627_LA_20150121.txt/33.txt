On the settlement date of the Mandatory Prepayment, the Issuer shall pay to each of the Bondholders holding Bonds, on a pro rata basis, the principal amount of each such Bond and any unpaid interest accrued up to (but not including) the settlement date, subject to Clause 10.4 below.
If, once the Issuer has disposed of all its assets, it has insufficient funds from the proceeds of such disposal or from other cash recoveries available to it ("Available Funds") to (i) repay the outstanding Bonds in foil and (ii) reserve an amount equal to the unpaid or projected Retained Amounts, the Issuer is entitled to withhold an amount equal to such Retained Amounts and shall apply the balance of the Available Funds in redemption of the outstanding Bonds. Following such redemption, the Bondholders have no further claims for payment against the Issuer under the Finance Documents.
