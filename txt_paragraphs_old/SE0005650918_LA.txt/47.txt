(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, a Restricted Payment may be made following the completion of an Equity Listing Event, if at the time of the Restricted Payment:
(ii) the Incurrence Test is met (calculated on a pro forma basis including the relevant Restricted Payment); and
(iii) the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments of the Group in any fiscal year (including the Restricted Payment in question) does not exceed fifty (50) per cent of the Group's consolidated net profit for the previous fiscal year.
(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) above, a Restricted Payment may at anytime be made in the form of repayments on Subordinated Loans and capitalized or accrued interest thereunder by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that such payments are funded with proceeds from a share issue by the Issuer or an unconditional and irrevocable equity injection into the Issuer by a Person not being a Group Company or which are otherwise explicitly permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement.
14.3 Nature of Business
The Issuer shall procure that no substantial change is made to the general nature of the business carried on by the Group (save for the Subsidiaries Permitted for Discontinuation) as of the First Issue Date, if such change is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
14.4 Financial Indebtedness
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of its Subsidiaries, incur any additional Financial Indebtedness, provided however that the Issuer and the Subsidiaries have a right to incur Financial Indebtedness that constitute Permitted Debt.
