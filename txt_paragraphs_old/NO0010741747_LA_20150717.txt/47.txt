the Security Interest.
8.4.1 The Guarantor hereby:
(a) guarantees to the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders), as and for its own debt as principal obligor and not merely as a surety (Norwegian: selvskyldnergaranti), the punctual performance of the Secured Obligations;
(b) undertakes with the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) that whenever the Issuer does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document, the Guarantor shall immediately on demand pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and
(c) agrees with the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as a result of an Obligor not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under any Finance Document on the date when it would have been due,
provided however that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Clause 8.4 (Guarantee and Indemnity), any amounts payable by the Guarantor pursuant to this Guarantee shall always be limited to the Limitation.
8.4.2 Continuing Guarantee
This Guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by the Issuer under the Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
