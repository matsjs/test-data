and provided further that, If the Volume Weighted Average Price of a Share Is not available on one or more of the said five Dealing Days, then the average of such Volume Weighted Average Prices which are available In that five-dealing-day period shall be used (subject to a minimum of two such prices) and If only one, or no, such Volume Weighted Average Price is available In the relevant period the Current Market Price shall be determined In good faith by an Independent Financial Adviser.

(b) any issue of Shares falling within clause 14.2 shall be disregarded;
