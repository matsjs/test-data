8.3. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, if any increase of the commitments under the Bank Facilities takes place (subject always to Clause 13.2(K)), the Loan Trustee shall take all reasonable required action in order to ensure that the first priority pledge over the Refunds granted in favour of the Banks shall be extended to secure such increased commitments, including but not limited to, interest, costs and expenses relating thereto, on a first priority basis.

The Loan Trustee undertakes, upon consenting to such disposal, to execute all documents and do all things which are reasonably necessary to release and deregister any first priority pledge over the Borrower's License of which the Borrower wishes to dispose of (the Loan Trustee may seek external advice (at the Borrower's expense) in this respect).
