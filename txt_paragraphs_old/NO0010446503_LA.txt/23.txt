8 Status of the Loan and security
8.1 The Loan shall rank ahead of all other existing and future Financial Indebtedness of the Borrower other than the Bank Facilities and obligations mandatorily preferred by law (for the avoidance of doubt, unsecured claims under the Bank Facilities shall rank pari passu with unsecured claims under the Loan, and all other Financial Indebtedness shall be subordinated in all means).
8.2 The Loan including interest and expenses shall be secured by the Loan Secmity.
8.3. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, if any increase of the commitments under the Bank Facilities takes place (subject always to Clause 13.2(K)), the Loan Trustee shall take all reasonable required action in order to ensure that the first priority pledge over the Refunds granted in favour of the Banks shall be extended to secure such increased commitments, including but not limited to, interest, costs and expenses relating thereto, on a first priority basis.
8.4 If any asset secured by the Licences Pledge is sold or in any other way disposed of (save for disposals set out in Clause 8.5 below) during the term of the Loan, the Borrower shall either replace the relevant asset with a similar asset with similar security within six months, or transfer the net proceeds from such asset disposal to the Escrow Account until such replacement is made. The Borrower may also use such proceeds to redeem part of the Loan or the entire Loan pursuant to the Call Option set out in Clause 10,2.
