Issuer's purchase of Notes
Voluntary total redemption (call option)
The Issuer may redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Notes in full any time at an amount per Note equal to:
(a) the Applicable Premium, if the Notes are redeemed during a period starting on the Issue Date and ending on a day falling immediately prior to the First Call Date;
(b) 103 per cent, of the Nominal Amount, if the Notes are redeemed during a period starting on the First Call Date and ending on the day falling immediately prior to the Final Maturity Date; and
(c) 100 per cent, of the Nominal Amount, if the Notes are redeemed during a period starting on the first Business Day falling thirty-one (31) months after the Issue Date and ending on the day falling immediately prior to the Final Maturity Date, provided that the voluntary total redemption is financed by way of another issue of notes (or other debt instruments) which the Noteholders may subscribe for;
in each case together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
Redemption in accordance with Clause 10.3.1 shall be made by the Issuer giving not less than fifteen (15) Business Days' notice to the Noteholders and the Agent. Any such notice is irrevocable but may, at the Issuer's discretion, contain one or more conditions precedent. Upon expiry of such notice and the fulfilment of the conditions precedent (if any), the Issuer is bound to redeem the Notes in full at the applicable amounts.
