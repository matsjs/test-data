The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that HoldCo shall not, permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (a) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to HoldCo or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any Financial Indebtedness owed to HoldCo or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries; (b) make loans or advances to HoldCo or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries; or (c) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to HoldCo or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries; in each case, only if such encumbrance or restriction result in a Material Adverse Effect and unless such encumbrance or restriction is contained in or related to Financial Indebtedness constituting a Permitted Debt, Permitted Security or Permitted Loan or is otherwise permitted to be incurred under these Terms and Conditions and the terms and conditions for the Existing Bonds.
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that HoldCo shall not, cause or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, directly or indirectly, to guarantee any Financial Indebtedness of HoldCo or any Restricted Subsidiary, and any refinancing thereof in whole or in part, unless such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a guarantor of the Bonds (an "Additional Guarantor") on the date on which such other guarantee is incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Agent a Guarantee, substantially in the same form as the Subsidiary Guarantors' Guarantees pursuant to which such Additional Guarantor will provide a Guarantee, which will be senior to or pari passu with its guarantee of such other Financial Indebtedness. Such Additional Guarantor shall be a "Subsidiary Guarantor" and such new Guarantee shall be a "Subsidiary Guarantor Guarantee" for the purpose of these Terms and Conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, HoldCo shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Bonds to the extent that such new Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in a violation of applicable law which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise
