When the requisite majority consents of the total Adjusted Nominal Amount pursuant to Clauses 15.5 and 15.6 have been received in a Written Procedure, the relevant decision shall be deemed to be adopted pursuant to Clause 15.5 or 15.6, as the case may be, even if the time period for replies in the Written Procedure has not yet expired.
The Issuer and the Agent (acting on behalf of the Bondholders) may agree to amend the Finance Documents or waive any provision in a Finance Document, provided that:
(a) in the opinion of the Agent and/or as confirmed by a reputable external expert engaged by the Agent, such amendment or waiver is not detrimental to the interest of the Bondholders as a group ; or
(b) such amendment or waiver is made solely for the purpose of rectifying obvious errors and mistakes; or
(c) such amendment or waiver is required by applicable law, a court ruling or a decision by a relevant authority; or
(d) such amendment or waiver has been duly approved by the Bondholders in accordance with Clause 15 (Decisions by Bondholders).
The consent of the Bondholders is not necessary to approve the particular form of any amendment to the Finance Documents. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the amendment.
The Agent shall promptly notify the Bondholders of any amendments or waivers made in accordance with Clause 18.1, setting out the date from which the amendment or waiver will be effective, and ensure that any amendments to the Finance Documents are published in the manner stipulated in Clause 10.4 (Publication of Finance Documents), and shall ensure that any amendments to the Finance Documents are duly registered with the CSD and each other relevant organisation or authority.
An amendment to the Finance Documents shall take effect on the date determined by the Bondholders Meeting, in the Written Procedure or by the Agent, as the case may be.
