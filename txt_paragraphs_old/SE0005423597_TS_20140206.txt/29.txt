(b) The Issuer shall immediately notify the Noteholders and the Agent upon becoming aware of the occurrence of a Change of Control Event or a Listing Failure Event. A notice may be given in advance of the occurrence of such event, conditioned upon the occurrence thereof.
(c) If the Agent is investigating an event or circumstance which it reasonably believes is an Event of Default or which would (with the expiry of a grace period, the giving of notice, the making of any determination or any combination of any of the foregoing) constitute an Event of Default, the Issuer shall within 30 days from the Agent's request submit a compliance certificate to the Agent. Such compliance certificate shall be in a form agreed between the Issuer and the Agent and shall contain (i) a confirmation that no Event of Default has occurred (or if an Event of Default has occurred, what steps have been taken to remedy it), (ii) a confirmation that the Liquid Assets are equal to or exceeds the Debt Service Amount, and (iii) copies of any notices sent to the Regulated Market on which the Notes are listed.
(d) The Issuer shall immediately notify the Agent (with full particulars) upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any event or circumstance which constitutes an Event of Default, or any event or circumstance which would (with the expiry of a grace period, the giving of notice, the making of any determination or any combination of any of the foregoing) constitute an Event of Default, and shall provide the Agent with such further information as it may reasonably request in writing following receipt of such notice. Should the Agent not receive such information, the Agent is entitled to assume that no such event or circumstance exists or can be expected to occur, provided that the Agent does not have actual knowledge of such event or circumstance.
(e) The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Agent according to this Clause 10.1 if informing the Agent would not conflict with any applicable laws or the rules and regulations of a Securities market on which any securities of the Issuer is listed. If such a conflict would exist pursuant to the rules and regulation of such Securities market or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek approval from the relevant Securities market or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Agent, in order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to this Clause 10.1.
10.2 Information from the Agent
(a) The Agent is entitled to disclose to the Noteholders any event or circumstance directly or indirectly relating to the Issuer or the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agent may, if it considers it to be beneficial to the interests of the Noteholders, delay disclosure or refrain from disclosing certain information, other than in respect of an Event of Default that has occurred and is continuing, and comply with a non-disclosure agreement entered into pursuant to Clause 10.1(e).
