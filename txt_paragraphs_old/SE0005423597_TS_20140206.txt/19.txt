(c) The maximum aggregate Initial Nominal Amount of the Notes on the First Issue Date shall be SEK 1,500,000,000.
(d) Each Note shall have an initial nominal amount of SEK 1,000,000 (the "Initial Nominal Amount"). All Initial Notes are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 99.128 per cent. of the Initial Nominal Amount.
(e) Provided that no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue, the Issuer may, at one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Notes. Subsequent Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate and the nominal amount and the final maturity applicable to the Initial Notes shall apply to Subsequent Notes. The price of the Subsequent Notes may be set at a discount or premium compared to the Nominal Amount.
(f) The Notes constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu with all direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer, except those obligations which are mandatorily preferred by law, and without any preference among them.
(g) The payment obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Finance Documents are guaranteed by the SAS Consortium in accordance with the Guarantee.
