Any Group Company may, subject to applicable law, at any time and at any price purchase Bonds. The Bonds held by a Group Company may at such Group Company's discretion be retained, sold or, if held by the Issuer, cancelled.
Early voluntary redemption by the Issuer (call option)
The Issuer may redeem all, but not only some, of the outstanding Bonds at any time prior to the First Call Date, at an amount equal to 100.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest, plus the Applicable Premium.
The Issuer may redeem all, but not only some, of the outstanding Bonds in full on any Business Day falling on or after the First Call Date but before the Final Redemption Date. The Bonds shall be redeemed at the Call Option Amount together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
Redemption in accordance with Clause 11.3.1 shall be made by the Issuer giving not less than 15 Business Days' notice to the Holders and the Agent. Any such notice shall state the Redemption Date and the relevant Record Date and is irrevocable but may, at the Issuer's discretion, contain one or more conditions precedent. Upon expiry of such notice and the fulfilment of the conditions precedent (if any), the Issuer is bound to redeem the Bonds in full at the applicable amounts.
Mandatory partial prepayment (upon an Excess Cash Event)
Upon an Excess Cash Event, the Issuer shall procure that an amount equal to any Excess Cash is used to partially repay the Bonds by way of reducing the Nominal Amount of each Bond pro rata. The amount to be prepaid shall be rounded down to the nearest SEK 1,000 per Bond.
