15.5
The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Agent according to Clause 15.4 if informing the
Agent would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with First
North. If such a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with First North or
otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek the approval from First North or
undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement
with the Agent, in order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to Clause 15.4.
