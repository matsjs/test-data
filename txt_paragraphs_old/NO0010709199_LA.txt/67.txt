GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY Guarantee The Guarantors jointly and severally, irrevocably and unconditionally:
(a) guarantee to the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) as for their own debt and not merely as surety the due and punctual performance by the Issuer of all its obligations under the Finance Documents and accept that the Bond Trustee may make a demand for payment to any and each of the Guarantors without any specific order;
29
(b) undertake with the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) that, whenever the Issuer does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document, the Guarantors shall, on the Bond Trustee's first written demand (No: pakravsgaranti) and in no event any later than five Business Days after the relevant Guarantor's receipt of such demand, pay that amount to the Bond Trustee or as it directs as if it were the principal obligor in respect of that amount, waiving all rights of objections and defences arising from the principal obligor with the written demand being the only requirement and evidence for the Guarantors having to pay any amount due under or in connection with any Finance Document; and
(c) agree with the Bond Trustee (on behalf of the Bondholders) that if, for any reason, any amount claimed by the Bond Trustee under this clause is not recoverable from the Issuer, then the Guarantor will be liable as a principal debtor and primary obligor to indemnify the Bond Trustee and each Bondholder for any loss each of them may incur as a result of the Issuer failing to pay any amount expressed to be payable by it under a Finance Document on the date when it ought to have been paid.
