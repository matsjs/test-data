(c) The Put Option may be exercised by each Bondholder by giving written notice of the request to its Account Manager. The Account Manager shall notify the Paying Agent of the redemption request. The settlement date of the Put Option shall be no later than 15 Business Days following the date when the Paying Agent received the repayment request.

Mandatory prepayment
Upon the occurrence of a Mandatory Prepayment Event, the Issuer shall, at the earlier of (A) the day the relevant Obligor receives the proceeds following the relevant Mandatory Repayment Event (if any) and (B) 30 days after the event triggering the actual Mandatory Repayment Event, redeem 100% of the Outstanding Bonds at the relevant Repayment Price (save as in the event of a Finnish Release where the redemption shall be limited to the available Disposal Proceeds).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Repayment Price shall be determined based on the date the Mandatory Prepayment Event occurred and not based on the date of repayment.
