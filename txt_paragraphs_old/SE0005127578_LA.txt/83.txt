Any matter not covered by Clause 18.5 shall require the consent of Bondholders representing more than fifty (50) per cent, of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for which Bondholders voting at a Bondholders' Meeting or for which Bondholders are replying in a Written Procedure in accordance with the instructions given pursuant to Clause 20.3. This includes, but is not limited to, any amendment to, or waiver of, the terms of any Finance Document that does not require a higher majority (other than an amendment permitted pursuant to Clause 21.1(a) or (b)), an acceleration of the Bonds, the appointment of a Bondholders' Committee, or the enforcement of any Transaction Security.
Any decision which extends or increases the obligations of the Issuer or the Agent, or limits or reduces the rights or benefits of the Issuer or the Agent, under the Finance Documents shall be subject to the Issuer's or the Agent's consent, as appropriate.
A Bondholder holding more than one Bond need not use all its votes or cast all the votes to which it is entitled in the same way and may in its discretion use or cast some of its votes only.
The Issuer may not, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Bondholder for or as inducement to any consent under these Terms and Conditions, unless such consideration is offered to all Bondholders that consent at the relevant Bondholders' Meeeting or in a Written Procedure within the time period stipulated for the consideration to be payable or the time period for replies in the Written Procedure, as the case may be.
A matter decided by a resolution passed at a duly convened and held Bondholders' Meeting or by way of Written Procedure is binding on all Bondholders, irrespective of them being present or represented at the Bondholders' Meeting or responding in the Written Procedure. The Bondholders that not have adopted or voted for a resolution shall not be liable for any damages that this may cause other Bondholders.
