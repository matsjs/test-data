The Agent shall convene a Bondholders' Meeting by sending a notice thereof to each Bondholder no later than five (5) Business Days after receipt of a request from the Issuer or the Bondholder(s) (or such later date as may be necessary for technical or administrative reasons).
The notice pursuant to Clause 19.1 shall include (i) time for the meeting, (ii) place for the meeting, (iii) agenda for the meeting (including each request for a decision by the Bondholders) and (iv) a form of power of attorney. Only matters that have been included in the notice may be resolved upon at the Bondholders' Meeting. Should prior notification by the Bondholders be required in order to attend the Bondholders' Meeting, such requirement shall be included in the notice.
The Bondholders' Meeting shall be held no earlier than fifteen (15) Business Days and no later than thirty (30) Business Days from the notice.
Without amending or varying these Terms and Conditions, the Agent may prescribe such further regulations regarding the convening and holding of a Bondholders' Meeting as the Agent may deem appropriate.
Quorum at a Bondholders' Meeting only exists if a Bondholder (or Bondholders) representing at least twenty (20) per cent, of the Adjusted Nominal Amount attend the meeting in person or by telephone conference (or appear through duly authorised representatives).
If a quorum does not exist at one Bondholders' Meeting, the Agent or the Issuer shall convene a second Bondholders' Meeting (in accordance with Clause 19.1) provided that the relevant proposal has not been withdrawn by the Agent, the Issuer or the relevant Noteholder(s), as the case may be. The quorum requirement in Clause 19.6 shall not apply to such second Bondholders' Meeting.
