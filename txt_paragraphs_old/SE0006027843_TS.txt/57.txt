11.3 11.4 11.5
Listing of Bonds
The Issuer shall ensure that the Bonds are listed on the corporate bond list of NASDAQ OMX Stockholm or, if such admission to trading is not possible to obtain or maintain, admitted to trading on another Regulated Market, not later than 12 months after the Issue Date and shall take all measures required to ensure that the Bonds, once listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable), continue being listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) for as long as any Bond is outstanding (however, taking into account the rules and regulations of NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) and the CSD (as amended from time to time) preventing trading in the Bonds in close connection to the redemption of the Bonds).
Nature of business
The Issuer shall procure that no substantial change is made to the general nature of the business as carried out by the Group as of the Issue Date.
Financial Indebtedness
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of the Subsidiaries, incur any additional Financial Indebtedness or maintain or prolong any existing Financial Indebtedness, provided however that the Issuer and the Subsidiaries have a right to incur, maintain and/or prolong Financial Indebtedness which constitute Permitted Debt.
Disposals of assets
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that no Group Company will, sell or otherwise dispose of all or some of the shares in any Group Company or of all or substantially all of its or a Group Company's assets or operations, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Property or any part of any Property, to any person not being the Issuer or any of its whollyowned Subsidiaries unless such disposal is made on customary arm's length terms at fair market value and constitutes a Permitted Partial Divestment which does not have a Material Adverse Effect. The shares in any of the Swedish Pledged Subsidiaries or the Finnish Pledged Subsidiaries may at no point be disposed of unless such disposal would take the form of a merger between any of the Issuer, the Swedish Pledged Subsidiaries or the Finnish Pledged Subsidiaries and such would not result in an Event of Default.
