In relation to the security over intra-group receivables (granted by each of the Issuer, Ovako Sweden AB and Ovako Bright Bar AB) and dividends under Security Documents governed by Swedish law certain bankruptcy limitations could apply under Swedish law. In particular, under the Bankruptcy Act (5w; konkurslagen (1987:672)), in a bankruptcy or in a company reconstruction where a composition among creditors has been approved by the court, any security granted may be recovered if (a) it was not provided for at the time the debt it secured arose or if it was not perfected without delay following the coming into existence of such debt, unless in the circumstances it was nevertheless ordinary, and (b) it was granted later than three months before the "relevant date" (broadly, the date when the petition for bankruptcy or company reconstruction was lodged). Such security may also be recovered if provided to a related party earlier than three months but later than two years before the relevant date, unless it can be shown that the debtor was not insolvent at the time of the action and did not become insolvent as a result of it.
Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released, including:
 upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes;
 upon release of the Guarantee (with respect to the liens securing such Guarantee granted by such Guarantor);
 in connection with a disposition of Collateral to any person other than the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture;
 if the Issuer designates any Guarantor to be an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and capital stock, of such unrestricted subsidiary;
 in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement; and
 in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
Even though holders of the Notes share in the Collateral securing the Notes ratably with the lenders under the Pension Insurance Line and the Revolving Credit Facility, under certain circumstances, the lenders under the Pension Insurance Line and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain of our hedging arrangements will control enforcement actions with respect to the Collateral through the Security Agent, whether or not holders of the Notes agree or disagree with those actions.
