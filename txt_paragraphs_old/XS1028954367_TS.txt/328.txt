Any enforcement instructions given must comply with certain security enforcement principles and the security enforcement objective, including: to achieve the security enforcement objective, namely to maximize, so far as is consistent with prompt and expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the Collateral, the recovery of all of the secured parties; (i) all enforcement proceeds will be received by the Security Agent in cash, or sufficient enforcement proceeds will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that, after distribution in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Pension Insurance Line Liabilities, the Credit Facility Liabilities and the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities will be repaid in full; (ii) to the extent that the enforcement is over Collateral other than capital stock with an aggregate book value exceeding EUR5,000,0000 or is over capital stock, the Security Agent shall obtain an opinion from a Financial Advisor that the proceeds received from such enforcement are fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances, provided that if such enforcement action is conducted by way of Public Auction, or made pursuant to any process or proceeding conducted by a competent enforcement authority or court of law, no Financial Advisor opinion is required. The Financial Adviser's opinion will be conclusive evidence that the security enforcement objective has been met.

providing valuations in respect of the relevant type of assets (in each case not being the firm appointed as the relevant Debtor's administrator or other relevant officer holder) selected by the Security Agent.
"Public Auction" means an auction or other competitive sale process of assets, by or on behalf of the Security Agent pursuant to an enforcement of Collateral (or by a member of the group in circumstances that are a distressed disposal), the process of such sale or disposal being conducted as follows:
a. prior to the sale or other disposal, the Security Agent shall consult with a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent (acting reasonably) with respect to the procedures which may reasonably be expected to be used to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable in the then prevailing market conditions (taking into account all relevant circumstances and with a view to facilitating a prompt and expeditious sale at the best price reasonably obtainable in the prevailing market conditions although there shall be no obligation to postpone any such sale in order to achieve a higher price);
b. subject to (ii) below, the Security Agent shall have implemented (to the extent permitted by applicable law) in all material respects the procedures recommended by such Financial Adviser in relation to such auction or process; and
c. the RCF Lenders, PIL Lenders, Hedge Counterparties, Noteholders, Pari Passu Creditors and creditors of Subordinated Liabilities shall have a right to participate in such auction or process, i.e. that any offer, or indication of a potential offer, that any of them makes shall be considered by the Security Agent or such Financial Adviser against the same criteria as any offer, or indication of a potential offer, by any other bidder or potential bidder.
For the purposes of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, (i) the Security Agent shall be entitled (at the cost of the group) to retain any Financial Adviser as its and/or any of the other Primary Creditors financial adviser to advise and assist in the proposed sale or disposition for such remuneration as the Security Agent in good faith determines is appropriate for the circumstances, (ii) except as required by applicable law, the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to use reasonable efforts to engage in a listing of any or all of any equity interests the subject of such auction or process, including without limitation if recommended by such Financial Adviser; (iii) the Security Agent and other Primary Creditors shall not under any circumstances be required to make representations, warranties or undertakings to any actual or proposed purchaser (other than customary representations in a security enforcement as to power to transfer the relevant equity interests or other assets pursuant to the Transaction Security Documents) or to indemnify any actual or proposed purchaser against any costs, liabilities or similar expenses or losses, and (iv) the Security Agent may (but is not required to) in all circumstances specify that no offer to purchase equity interests or other assets will be entertained unless such offer: (A) is for all (and not some only) of the equity interests or other assets being sold or otherwise disposed of, (B) is for cash consideration payable at closing (and therefore not including, for the avoidance of doubt, any element of deferred consideration) and is not subject to any financing conditions other than customary UK "certain funds" conditions, and/or (C) contemplates a closing of the sale of the equity interests or other assets in not more than three months (or such longer period as the Security Agent may specify) from the time of signing of the sale and purchase agreement in respect of such equity interests or other assets.
