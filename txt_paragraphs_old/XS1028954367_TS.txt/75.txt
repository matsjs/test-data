(1) Contribution is defined as net sales less (i) changes in inventories and work in progress, (ii) costs for raw materials and supplies, (iii) foreign exchange differences on purchased goods, (iv) energy costs and (v) freight and distribution costs. Contribution margin is defined as contribution as a percentage of net sales. Our management uses Contribution and the Contribution margin as measures for the development of our sales prices compared to our direct variable costs. Contribution is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Accordingly, it should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit as indicators of our performance. Contribution, as presented in this offering memorandum, may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies due to differences in the way this measures are calculated.
Contribution is calculated as follows:
Net s a l e s ....................................................................................................... .

Foreign exchange differences on purchased goods (unaudited) . . . Energy (unaudited) ................................................................................................ .
