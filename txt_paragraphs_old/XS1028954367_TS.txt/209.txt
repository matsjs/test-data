The significant reduction in sales volume was primarily due to a significant decrease in demand for our products as a result of the unfavorable economic conditions, which were challenging throughout 2012 due to great uncertainty over developments in Europe and globally. Orders were weak as a result of lower production rates combined with inventory drawdowns by our customers. Our order intake in 2012 decreased by approximately 22%, compared to 2011.
