Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion with reasonable assurance on the proposed appropriations o f the company' s profit or loss and on the administration based on our audit. We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.
A s a basis for our opinion on the Board o f Directors' proposed appropriations o f the company' s profit or loss, we examined whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.
A s a basis for our opinion concerning discharge from liability, in addition to our audit o f the annual accounts, we examined significant decisions, actions taken and circumstances o f the company in order to determine whether any member o f the Board o f Directors or the Managing Director is liable to the company. We also examined whether any member o f the Board o f Directors or the Managing Director has, in any other way, acted in contravention o f the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts A ct or the Articles of Association.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.
