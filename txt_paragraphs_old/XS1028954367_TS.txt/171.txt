Energy expenses are affected by various factors, including the availability of supplies of particular sources of energy, energy prices and regulatory decisions. In particular, recently electricity prices have fluctuated significantly. Average spot prices in EUR per MWh for electricity on the NASDAQ OMX market were 47.1, 31.2 and 38.1 in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. In the first quarter of 2014, the average spot price for electricity on the NASDAQ OMX was EUR30.2 per MWh. Due to the Nordic winter, electricity prices during the winter are typically highest.
We generally purchase electricity in the spot market, primarily NASDAQ OMX. In addition, in 2011, we entered into an electricity supply agreement at a fixed price and for a fixed volume in Finland, which covered approximately 26% of our electricity demand in Finland in 2013. This supply agreement will expire in December 2015.
To mitigate price volatility that causes fluctuations in cash flows and earnings, we hedge portions of the variable price of electricity through separate hedges by entering into financial contracts, either bilaterally or over the NASDAQ OMX market.
We changed our electricity prices hedging policy in the spring of 2012. Under our new policy, we hedge the price of our anticipated electricity consumption in the coming 24 months. We hedge between 40% and 60% of our anticipated electricity consumption for the next 12 months and between 20% and 50% of our anticipated electricity consumption in the following 12 months. The hedging is done on a rolling quarterly basis utilizing quarterly forward contracts. Our new electricity prices hedging policy had a positive impact on our result of operations in 2013 because we benefited from lower electricity prices on the spot market as our previous hedge portfolio was phasing out (approximately 60% hedge level in 2013 from contracts under the old policy) as a result of our new policy.

At year-end 2013, our anticipated electricity consumption for 2014 and 2015 was hedged as follows (including the long-term supply agreement in Finland, which will expire in December 2015): 57% for 2014 and 38% for 2015. A rise of 10% in the price of electricity compared to the price at December 31, 2013 would have an impact on our comprehensive income, before tax, of EUR2.1 million, due to revaluation of the derivatives.
