with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption " --R estricte d p a ym en ts". If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption " -- Incu rrence o f In d e b te d n e ss a n d issuance o f p re fe r re d sto c k ", the Parent will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Parent may at anytime designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; p ro v id e d that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption " --Incurrence o f In d e b te d n e ss and issuance o f p re fe rre d sto c k ", calculated on a p ro form a basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the admission to trading of the Notes on the Euro MTF Market for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer determines that it is unable to list or it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and withdrawal from trading of the Notes on the Euro MTF Market, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on another internationally recognized stock exchange or exchange regulated market in western Europe.
Limitation on issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness
The Parent will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer) that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee the payment of, assume or in any manner become liable with respect to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture providing for the Note Guarantee of the payment of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Guarantee will be senior to or p a ri passu with such Restricted Subsidiary's Guarantee of such other Indebtedness.
Simultaneously with the execution of such supplemental indenture, the Parent will cause all of the Capital Stock in such Restricted Subsidiary owned by the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries to be pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees.
Each additional Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to any Guarantees of any Restricted Subsidiary given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less than EUR250 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee was given, of at least A or the equivalent thereof by S&P and at least A2 or the equivalent thereof by Moody's, in connection with the operation of cash management programs established in the ordinary course of business for the benefit of the Parent or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in a violation of applicable law or any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary that, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through measures reasonably available to the Parent or the Restricted Subsidiary.
