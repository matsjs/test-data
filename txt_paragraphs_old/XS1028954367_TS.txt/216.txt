Cost of goods sold decreased by EUR107.7 million, or 11.0%, from EUR977.4 million in 2011 to EUR869.7 million in 2012. The decrease in cost of goods sold in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily the result of decreases in raw materials costs, energy costs, costs for supplies and freight and other distribution costs, which were offset by higher costs related to changes in inventories and work in progress.
Our reduced raw materials costs in 2012 were mainly due to the reduced consumption of raw materials as a result of the significant decrease in our sales volume, which decreased by 18% from 851 kt in 2011 to 694 kt in 2012, and reduced prices for scrap and alloy. The significant decrease in volume was also the main driver for the decreases in costs for energy and supplies and freight and other distribution costs. Changes in inventories and work in progress had a negative impact on costs of goods sold in 2012, compared to a positive impact in 2011. This reflects the significant decrease in our inventories in 2012 as a result of the significant decrease in sales volume and our decision to actively manage our working capital. In 2011, our inventories increased significantly reflecting an increase in our sales volume.
Our employee benefit expenses in 2012 decreased by 1.0%. Our cost savings in 2012 as a result of headcount reductions accounted for within cost of goods sold through reductions in production shifts at our steel mills and flexible work time arrangements in Sweden and Finland were partially offset by the appreciation of the SEK against the euro and salary inflation. On a constant currency basis, our employee benefit expenses in 2012 decreased by EUR6.3 million, or 4.0%, compared to 2011.
Selling expenses. Our selling expenses in 2012 were slightly higher than in 2011, mainly reflecting the strengthening of our sales and marketing organization in response to the significant drop in sales volume amid uncertain economic conditions, which we started in 2012.
Administrative expenses. The slight increase in our administrative expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly attributable to the strengthening of the SEK against the EUR.
