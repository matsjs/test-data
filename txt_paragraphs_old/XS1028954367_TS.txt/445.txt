"Subordinated Shareholder Debt" means, collectively, any debt provided to the Parent by any Parent Entity or any Permitted Holder, in exchange for or pursuant to any security, instrument or agreement other than Capital Stock, together with any such security, instrument or agreement and any other security or instrument other than Capital Stock issued in payment of any obligation under any Subordinated Shareholder Debt; p ro v id e d that such Subordinated Shareholder Debt:
(2) does not (including upon the happening of any event) require the payment of cash interest prior to the first anniversary of the maturity of the Notes;
(3) does not (including upon the happening of any event) provide for the acceleration of its maturity nor confers on its shareholders any right (including upon the happening of any event) to declare a default or event of default or take any enforcement action, in each case, prior to the first anniversary of the maturity of the Notes;
(4) is not secured by a lien on any assets of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary and is not guaranteed by any Subsidiary of the Parent;
(5) is subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of the Notes in the event of any default, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, winding up or other disposition of assets of the Parent at least to the same extent as the Subordinated Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) are subordinated to the Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement;
(6) does not (including upon the happening of any event) restrict the payment of amounts due in respect of the Notes, compliance by the Issuer with its obligations under the Notes or compliance by the Parent under the Indenture;
(7) does not (including upon the happening of an event) constitute Voting Stock; and
(8) is not (including upon the happening of any event) mandatorily convertible or exchangeable, or convertible or exchangeable at the option of the holder, in whole or in part, prior to the date on which the Notes mature other than into or for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Parent;
p ro vid e d , h o w ever, that upon any event or circumstance that results in such Indebtedness ceasing to qualify as Subordinated Shareholder Debt, such Indebtedness shall constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Parent, and any and all Restricted Payments made through the use of the net proceeds from the incurrence of such Indebtedness since the date of the original issuance of such Subordinated Shareholder Debt shall constitute new Restricted Payments that are deemed to have been made after the date of the original issuance of such Subordinated Shareholder Debt.
