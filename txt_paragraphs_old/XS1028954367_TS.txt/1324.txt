CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 27. FAIR vALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LiABiLiTiES
27.1. Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortised cost In management's assessment, the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities substantially coincide with fair value as explained in Notes 15 and 16. In connection with determining the fair value of loan debt, management has found no reason to presume changes have oc curred in the interest margin that existed when the loans were raised.
27.2. Fair values of other financial instruments Measurement methods and assumptions applied to estimate fair value:
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is determined as fol lows:
- The fair value of financial assets and liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active, liquid markets is determined with reference to quoted market prices.
- The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) is determined using generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis that take figures from observable market transactions and the quoted market prices of compa rable instruments.
- The fair value of derivative instruments is estimated with refer ence to quoted market prices. When such parameters are unavailable, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instrument and alternative pricing models for comparable derivative instruments. Foreign currency hedges are esti mated using the quoted exchange rate and the yield curve from a quoted interest rate that matches the contract maturity date. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on a suitable yield curve from a listed stock exchange.
