In considering the interests of the holders of Notes, while title to the Notes is registered in the name of a nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Trustee may have regard to, and rely on, any information provided to it by those clearing systems as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its accountholders with entitlements to Notes and may consider such interests as if such accountholders were the holders of the Notes.
For the purposes of enforcement of the provisions of the Indenture against the Trustee, the persons named in a certificate of the holder of the Notes in respect of which a Global Note is issued shall be recognized as the beneficiaries of the trusts set out in the Indenture to the extent of the principal amounts of their interests in the Notes set out in the certificate of the holder, as if they were themselves the holders of Notes in such principal amounts.
