(7) "--Lim itatio n on issuances o f G u aran tees o f In d e b te d n e ss"; and
During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, neither the Parent nor any Restricted Subsidiary may designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to definition of Unrestricted Subsidiary.
If and while the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the "Reversion Date") one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this "D escrip tio n o f N otes" as the "Suspension Period". Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from Net Proceeds shall be reset to zero.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes; p ro v id e d that (i) with respect to Restricted Payments made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described below under "--R estricted pa ym en ts" had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period; (ii) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (2) of the definition of Permitted Debt; (iii) any transactions with Affiliates entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be

permitted pursuant to clause (10) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "-- Transactions w ith A ffilia te s"; (iv) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under "--D ividen d a n d o th e r p a y m en t restriction s a ffe ctin g R estricte d Su bsidiaries" that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "--D ividen d a n d o th e r p a y m e n t restrictio n s a ffe ctin g R estricte d Su b sid ia ries"; and (v) no Restricted Subsidiary shall be required to comply with the covenant described under "-- Lim itation on issuances o f G uarantees o f In d e b te d n e ss" after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee entered into by such Restricted Subsidiary during any Suspension Period.
The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the two conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this heading have been satisfied, provided that such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of the covenants set forth above to be effective.
There can be no assurance that the Notes will achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating.
