Therefore, neither the Trustee nor the holders of the Notes may, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The holders of the Notes may only take action through the Security Agent. The Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the holders or the Trustee. In certain circumstances, the Trustee will have the ability to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action under the Security Documents.
