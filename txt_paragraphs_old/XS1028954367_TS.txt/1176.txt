Deferred tax assets and tax liabilities are determined at the rates in effect for the period when the asset is realised or the liability paid based on tax rates (and legislation) enacted or announced at the reporting date. The effects of deferred tax assets and tax liabilities recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised according to the same principles.
Interest, dividends and royalties are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits of the transaction will flow to the enterprise and the amount o f revenue can be measured reliably.
Financial assets Financial assets have been classified at fair value through profit and loss, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. Initial classification of a financial asset is based on the nature and purpose of the asset.
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss are rec ognised using trade date accounting. Realised and unrealised gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognised in comprehen sive income for the year in the period in which they arise.
Loan receivables and trade receivables
Loan receivables and trade receivables include assets that arise upon transfers o f cash and cash equivalents, goods or services to a debtor. Receivables are reported as current or non-current depending on the maturity date. Loans issued by the group are recognised at cost. An impairment loss on a loan or receivable is recognised when the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
