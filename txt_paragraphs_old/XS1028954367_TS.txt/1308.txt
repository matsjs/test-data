Term loan and revolving credit facility In conjunction with the change of ownership in 2010, Triako Midco AB and subsidiaries entered into a Senior Facilities Agreement (`SFA') totalling EU R 385 million.
The loan agreement includes a revolving credit facility of EU R 75 (75) million which was unutilised at year-end. Total credit utilisation at 31 December was E U R 296 (310) million.
The interest rate for the SFA is the average annual IBO R plus lend ing margin.
Under the terms of the loan, the company must ensure compliance with financial covenants based on cash flow, interest coverage ratio, leverage ratio, capital expenditures, minimum EBITD A and minimum cash. The company was in compliance with all covenants at the reporting date.
All shares in large group subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral for the Senior Facilities. In addition, the subsidiaries have issued prop erty mortgages and floating charges. See also Note 34.
Arrangement fees were paid in conjunction with the initial draw down of the first SFA loan. Arrangement costs are amortised over the term of the loan and recognised as prepayments that reduce interest bearing-liabilities.
