Fair value of loans and receivables and other financial liabilities: For cash and cash equivalents, and for current receivables and liabilities, the fair value is considered to be equal to the carry ing amount. The fair value of interest-bearing liabilities has been calculated based on the discounted value of future payments, including interest and amortisation. In the calculation, manage ment has found no reason to presume changes have occurred in the interest margin that existed when the loans were raised. The difference between the carrying amount and fair value of non-current interest-bearing debt is primarily due to the deferred financing costs which reduced the carrying amount. Fair values of available for sale financial assets: Available for sale financial assets include unlisted equities which are measured at acquisition value and for which information on fair value cannot be reliably estimated.
M e a su re m e n ts of a s s e t s and liabilities are cla ss ifie d in a fair value hierarchy a s follows:
Level 1: Fair value is determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments; Level 2: Fair value is determined based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and Level 3: Fair value is determined based on inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. Ovako's derivatives are Level 2. Interest-bearing liabilities are Level 3.
