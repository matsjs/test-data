In the case of an Event of Default specified in clause (9) of the preceding paragraph, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may, and the Trustee, upon request of such holders, shall, declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such holders have offered to the Trustee, and it has received, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except (subject to the provisions described under "A m e n d m e n t, su p p le m e n t an d w a iv er") to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:
(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
(2) holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3) such holders have offered the Trustee, and it has received, security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
(5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.
The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding may, on behalf of the holders of all outstanding Notes, waive any past default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of premium, if any, any Additional Amounts or interest on any Note held by a non-consenting holder (which may only be waived with the consent of each holder of Notes affected).
The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture.
