Risks relating to an investment in the Notes and the Guarantees
The Notes and each of the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to present and future liabilities of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.
Not all our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors and claims of preference shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by holders of the Notes under the Notes or the Guarantees. Accordingly, in the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, administration, reorganization or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding of any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our, the Issuer's or the applicable Guarantor's non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

See "Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on validity and enforceability o f the guarantees and security interests".
Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court could subordinate or void the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral granted by the relevant Security Documents and, if payment had already been made under a Guarantee or upon enforcement of the Collateral, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court found that:
· the relevant Guarantee or security interest under the Security Documents was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security;
