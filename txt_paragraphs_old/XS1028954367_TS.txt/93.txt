(a) This represents the costs of salaries, social charges and pension costs provided to 30.6 full time equivalent employees who were made redundant and have left us in the period from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014, as if such employees had left on April 1, 2013.
(b) This represents the estimated costs of salaries, social charges and pension costs associated with 80.8 full time equivalent employees who will be made redundant, as if such employees had left on April 1, 2013. These planned headcount reductions have been approved by our board as part of our 2014 budget and are being implemented in 2014.
(c) In 2012, we spent EUR2.5 million on transporting our products from production units in Sweden to customers in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. A t the end of 2013 we entered into new transport agreements under more favorable pricing terms. Under the new agreements and assuming the same transportation volumes, destinations and batch sizes in the twelve months ending March 31, 2014 as those in the calendar year 2012 , we estimate we would have saved approximately EUR1.0 million over the full twelve months, of which we have already realized EUR0.5 million since the agreements came into effect. As our actual transportation volume in Eastern Europe in the twelve months ending March 31, 2014 was higher than in the calendar year 2012, our transportation cost savings based on actual transportation volume in the twelve months ending March 31, 2014, and assuming the same destinations and batch sizes as those in the calendar year 2012, would have been higher.
(d) This represents the estimated impact of our new electricity hedging policy, as if such new hedging policy had been fully effective since April 1, 2013. We have implemented the following changes in our hedging policy: (i) two year electricity hedging horizon instead of a five year electricity hedging horizon; (ii) decrease of our electricity hedging from approximately 80% to 100% of our estimated consumption to approximately 40% to 60% of our estimated consumption; and (iii) use of quarterly hedges instead of yearly hedges. The calculation of our savings is based on (i) a neutral 50% hedge level for the current and coming quarter, (ii) actual market prices for quarterly forward electricity contracts quoted on NASDAQ OMX at the time we would have entered into the contracts, (iii) actual market prices five market days before quarter end, and (iv) our estimated electricity consumption. We believe these changes allow us to be more responsive to changes in the outlook for electricity prices and avoid historical over-hedging mainly in the third quarter of the year when our electricity consumption is typically lower.
(e) This represents estimated electricity certificate savings as a result of the intra-group merger of Ovako Hellefors AB and Ovako Tube & Ring AB with Ovako Hofors AB on April 1, 2014, as if such merger had been effective since April 1, 2013.
