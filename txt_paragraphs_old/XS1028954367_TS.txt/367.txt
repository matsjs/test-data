(12) Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in respect of Management Advances;
(13) Indebtedness of any Person outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness incurred to provide all or any portion of the funds used to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary); provided, however, with respect to this clause (13), that at the time of the acquisition or other transaction pursuant to which such Indebtedness was deemed to be incurred (x) the Parent would have been able to incur 1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13) or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Parent would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13);
(14) Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with any Qualified Receivables Transaction;
(15) the incurrence by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at anytime outstanding, not to exceed 25.0 million; and
(16) the incurrence by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently drawn against insufficient funds, so long as such Indebtedness is covered within thirty Business Days.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors may not incur Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or preferred stock pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or under clauses (8) or (15) of the definition of Permitted Debt if, after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or issuance (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), the aggregate amount of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and preferred stock will exceed at any time, exceed EUR10.0 million.
For purposes of determining compliance with this " Incurrence o f Indebtedness and issuance o f preferred stock" covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (16) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant; provided, however, that Indebtedness incurred under clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt may not be reclassified, unless upon such reclassification it no longer has priority with respect to distributions of proceeds of any enforcement of Collateral.
The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; provided, in each such case, that the amount of any such accrual, accretion or payment is included in Fixed Charges of the Parent as accrued.
