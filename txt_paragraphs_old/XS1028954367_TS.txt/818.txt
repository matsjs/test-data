CCrreeddiitt rainskd icsoduenfitneerpdaarstythreiskrisk that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations. The group is exposed to credit and counterparty risk against financial counterparties when funds are deposited, when positive cash balances are maintained with banks and when financial derivatives are acquired. These risks are minimised by contracting only with financially stable banks or other counterparties.
Beyond the foregoing, credit risks are associated with trade receivables. Exposure to credit risk in trade receivables is ma naged according to the principles set out in the Credit Manage ment Rules and Guidelines established by group management. According to these principles credit risk in trade receivables is managed primarily through credit risk insurance, but also bank guarantees, advance and cash payment requirements and letter of credit to reduce the credit risk. A credit limit is established for each customer by Ovakos' insurance company or Ovakos' internal credit control. The non-covered part of the trade receivables should not exceed 2% of estimated yearly invoicing. At year-end,
over 95% of Ovako's outstanding trade receivables were covered by credit insurance. The five largest customers (groups including subsidiaries) account for approximately 30% of consolidated sales and trade receivables.
