Our reduced raw materials costs in 2013 were mainly attributable to reduced prices for scrap and alloy and an improved optimization of our use of alloy contained in scrap, which reduced our costs for alloy. The impact of changes in inventories and work in progress on our cost of goods sold resulted in an increase of cost of goods sold by EUR2.6 million in 2013, compared to an increase of EUR15.9 million in 2012. The lower impact of changes in inventories and work in progress in 2013 was primarily due to the lower decrease in inventory volume in 2013. In 2012, our inventory volume decreased significantly reflecting both a significant decrease in sales volume and our decision to actively manage our working capital. The decrease in our energy expenses was the result of lower consumption of energy in 2013 and reduced electricity costs as a
result of our new electricity prices hedging policy, which we adopted in the spring of 2012 and which reduced our costs in relation to electricity hedging contracts in 2013. The decrease in our other operating costs was primarily due to our initiatives to reduce operating costs in relation to maintenance and become more efficient. The reduction in our costs for supplies mainly reflected a lower consumption as a result of decreases in our sales volume. The decrease in our freight and other distribution costs was mainly driven by lower sales volume and the impact of lower transportation costs in Eastern Europe as a result of renegotiated transportation agreements, which became effective on October 1, 2013.
Our employee benefit expenses in 2013 decreased by 0.3%. Our cost savings in 2013 as a result of headcount reductions accounted for within cost of goods sold through reductions in production shifts and flexible work time arrangements in Sweden and Finland were partially offset by the appreciation of the SEK against the euro and salary inflation. On a constant currency basis, our employee benefit expenses in 2013 decreased by EUR1.2 million, or 0.8%, compared to 2012.
Selling expenses. Selling expenses in 2013 remained stable compared to our selling expenses in 2012 despite the strengthening of our sales presence in a number of markets, such as Eastern Europe, China and Italy. The majority of our selling expenses relate to employee costs.
Administrative expenses. The decrease in administrative expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly attributable to cost reductions and reductions of administrative personnel at our main production units in Sweden and Finland.
Other operating income. Other operating income decreased slightly in 2013 compared to 2012. Both years included insurance compensations in relation to fires at our Imatra mill in Finland. A higher insurance compensation of EUR8.0 million in 2013, compared to EUR7.3 million in 2012, was offset by decrease in rents and other income items.
Operating profit/(loss). As a result of the factors discussed above we suffered an operating loss in 2013, compared to an operating profit in 2012.
Financial income. Our financial income remained substantially stable in 2013 compared to 2012. There was an increase of EUR0.1 million in 2013 compared to 2012 due to an increase in income arising from receivables.
Financial costs. Financial costs decreased by EUR6.4 million from EUR33.2 million in 2012 to EUR26.8 million in 2013, which was primarily attributable to positive effects of currency revaluation of pension liabilities and cash items of EUR3.4 million in 2013, while the financial costs in 2012 were affected by an impairment of financial receivables of EUR1.3 million and a negative currency revaluation of pension liabilities and cash items of EUR2.9 million. These cost decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expenses for financial liabilities at amortized cost.
