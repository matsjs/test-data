Complex, case specific legal issues often apply to enforcement. These aspects are discussed below on a general level only.
Enforcement outside of bankruptcy proceedings
Depending on the type of security arrangement / asset under security, the secured creditor may, generally, enforce the security independently (such as security over shares, bank accounts and receivables) or through public enforcement authorities (such as floating charges and real estate mortgages).
When enforcing a security, the secured creditor has a duty to take into account, in an appropriate way in the circumstances, the interests of the pledgor and those of other potential interested parties, such as any second lien pledgees or floating charge holders. In practice, this means, in te r alia, that the secured creditor may not sell the secured assets for a price lower than fair market value in the then current circumstances. This duty of care is generally deemed to apply irrespective of the terms of the security agreement.
When the secured creditor enforces security outside of bankruptcy proceedings and to the extent that the net proceeds exceed the creditor's secured claim, the secured creditor must hold the excess proceeds for the account of any second lien pledgees, floating charge holders and/or the pledgor, as appropriate.
Enforcement during bankruptcy proceedings
In a bankruptcy scenario where the secured creditor enforces the security independent from the concurrent bankruptcy proceedings (which is possible in respect of e.g. security over shares, bank accounts, receivables and IPR, but not for floating charges), the secured creditor will use the enforcement proceeds to satisfy its secured claim. The secured creditor shall then render to the bankruptcy liquidator an account of the proceeds of the enforcement and transfer to the bankruptcy liquidator the net proceeds from the enforcement that exceed the creditor's secured claim.
