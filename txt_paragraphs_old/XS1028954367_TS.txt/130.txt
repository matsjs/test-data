Other than providing management services, the Issuer is a holding company and depends on distributions from its subsidiaries to service and repay the Notes; certain covenants in our financing arrangements and other agreements may limit the availability of operating cash flow to the Issuer.
Other than providing management services, the Issuer is a holding company and conducts its operations principally through, and derives its revenues principally from, its subsidiaries. As such the Issuer will be dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to make timely payments under the Proceeds Loans and other loans and distributions. The ability of the Issuer's subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments to the Issuer will be subject to the availability of profits or funds for such purpose which, in turn, will depend on the future performance of the subsidiary concerned which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond its control. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the making of such distributions contained in its financing arrangements and in applicable laws and regulations. Although security will be granted over the receivables under the Proceeds Loans to secure the Notes and the Guarantees, you should only rely on the Guarantees and the other liens in favor of the Notes and the Guarantees to provide credit support in respect of payments of principal or interest on the Notes as the Proceeds Loans and certain other intercompany loans may be amended in certain circumstances. The terms of the Proceeds Loans do not prevent the borrower thereunder from prepaying loan amounts or offsetting them against certain other claims. As a result, the initial amounts of the Proceeds Loans may be reduced prior to the maturity of the Notes. See "Description of other indebtedness". There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that alternative sources of financing will be available at any time in an amount sufficient to enable these subsidiaries to service their indebtedness, to fund their other liquidity needs and to make payments to the Issuer sufficient to allow all payment obligations under the Notes to be met.
Our significant leverage and debt service obligations may make it difficult for us to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and operate our business.
Upon the consummation of the Refinancing, we will have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness with significant debt service requirements. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Refinancing, our total indebtedness (including the Notes) would have been EUR300.3 million as of March 31, 2014.
Our significant leverage could have important consequences for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:
· making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and liabilities;
· requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt instead of operations, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, and other general corporate purposes;
· increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, a downturn in our business, or generally adverse economic or industry conditions;
