The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment under or with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.
The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. These Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Note Guarantees to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such limitations, see " Risk factors--Risks relating to an investment in the Notes and the Guarantees--The Guarantees and security interests on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability".
