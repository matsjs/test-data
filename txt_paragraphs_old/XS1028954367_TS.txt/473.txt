Enforcement during bankruptcy proceedings
After bankruptcy proceedings have been initiated, there are four options available for the enforcement of a real estate mortgage:
(i) Private (or public) sale by the liquidator with the consent of the mortgagee(s).
(ii) If the mortgagee(s) does not give its consent for the liquidator to effect a private (or public) sale, the liquidator may seek the court's approval for the sale.
(iii) Despite the bankruptcy proceedings, the mortgagee can proceed to seek a court order to allow the mortgagee to independently enforce the mortgage by arranging the sale of the underlying real property through public enforcement authorities.
(iv) After three years have passed since the commencement of the bankruptcy, public sale by the liquidator without the consent of the mortgagee(s) or a court order.
In a bankruptcy scenario where the bankruptcy liquidator enforces the security, the bankruptcy liquidator will distribute the enforcement proceeds to the secured creditor up to the amount of the creditor's secured claim, whereas any excess proceeds will form a part of the assets of the estate (to be distributed to creditors).
Irrespective of whether the enforcement in bankruptcy was carried out by the secured creditor independently or by the bankruptcy liquidator, should the enforcement proceeds not suffice to satisfy the creditor's secured claim, the outstanding balance of the secured creditor's claim will constitute an ordinary unsecured claim towards the bankruptcy estate and will rank p ro rata with the claims of other unsecured creditors.
