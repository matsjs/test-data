In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream (or its respective nominee), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The common depositary will surrender such Global Note to the Registrar for cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the common depositary will request the Registrar or the Trustee to mark down, endorse and return the applicable Global Note to reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such partial redemption. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at anytime, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their participants' accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate (including the pool factor); provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than EUR100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.
We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the relevant Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent in euro

for onward payment to common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common depositary will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts free and clear of, without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under "D escrip tio n o f N otes--A d d itio n a l a m o u n ts". If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under "D escrip tion o f N otes--A d d itio n a l am o unts" we will pay such Additional Amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts received by any holder of the relevant Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding are not less than the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.
Under the terms of the Indenture, we, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and the Paying Agent will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:
· any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, or indirect participant or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;
· any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or
· the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream and any nominee thereof, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.
Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such participants.
