Asset sales
The Parent will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:
(1) the Parent (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and
(2) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:
(a) any liabilities, as recorded on the balance sheet of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee), that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and as a result of which the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with respect to such liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities;
(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Parent or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 90 days following the closing of the Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;
(c) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (1)(b) or (1)(e) of the next paragraph of this covenant;
(d) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sales having an aggregate Fair Market Value, when taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (d) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of 15.0 million and 2.0% of Tangible Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value);
