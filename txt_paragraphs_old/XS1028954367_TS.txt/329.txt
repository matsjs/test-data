For the purposes of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, (i) the Security Agent shall be entitled (at the cost of the group) to retain any Financial Adviser as its and/or any of the other Primary Creditors financial adviser to advise and assist in the proposed sale or disposition for such remuneration as the Security Agent in good faith determines is appropriate for the circumstances, (ii) except as required by applicable law, the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to use reasonable efforts to engage in a listing of any or all of any equity interests the subject of such auction or process, including without limitation if recommended by such Financial Adviser; (iii) the Security Agent and other Primary Creditors shall not under any circumstances be required to make representations, warranties or undertakings to any actual or proposed purchaser (other than customary representations in a security enforcement as to power to transfer the relevant equity interests or other assets pursuant to the Transaction Security Documents) or to indemnify any actual or proposed purchaser against any costs, liabilities or similar expenses or losses, and (iv) the Security Agent may (but is not required to) in all circumstances specify that no offer to purchase equity interests or other assets will be entertained unless such offer: (A) is for all (and not some only) of the equity interests or other assets being sold or otherwise disposed of, (B) is for cash consideration payable at closing (and therefore not including, for the avoidance of doubt, any element of deferred consideration) and is not subject to any financing conditions other than customary UK "certain funds" conditions, and/or (C) contemplates a closing of the sale of the equity interests or other assets in not more than three months (or such longer period as the Security Agent may specify) from the time of signing of the sale and purchase agreement in respect of such equity interests or other assets.
Turnover
