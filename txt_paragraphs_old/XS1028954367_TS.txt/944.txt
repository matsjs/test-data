Amendments to IAS 19 provide, among other things, new accounting principles for defined benefit pension plans. The corridor approach and the ability to immediately recognise actuarial gains and losses disappear. In addition, the interest rate for calculating pension liabilities must also be used for estimated returns on pension assets. Furthermore, revalua tions are recognised in other comprehensive income, i.e. actuarial gains and losses and the difference between actual and expected returns on pension assets must be recognised in other comprehensive income. The amendments enter into force for financial years commencing 1January 2013 or later and have been approved by the EU. Within the group there are defined benefit pension plans and the group has already chosen to recognise actuarial gains and losses directly in other comprehensive income. However, the amendments introduced in IAS 19 with regard to the calculation o f pensions will mean some changes, and the revaluation that will in future be recognised in other comprehensive income will not have exactly the same composition as previously recognised.
