(1) The unaudited pro forma financial data reflects the impact of the issuance of the Notes and the associated repayment of the Senior Credit Facilities and reflects the impact of certain cost saving actions that we have taken or will take (as described below). These figures are not intended to represent pro forma financial information prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act or other SEC requirements and have not been prepared on the basis of IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles.
(2) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, further adjusted to reflect events that occurred in the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 or are planned for 2014, as described below. We believe that this measure provides management and investors additional information related to the ongoing results of operations. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure computed in accordance with IFRS and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or net profit as indicators of our performance, or as alternatives to cash flows from operations as a measure of our liquidity.
