Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost adjusted for cumulative depreciation and impairment, if any. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the asset are capitalised as a component o f cost if the time required to bring the asset to working condition for its intended use or sale is material. In accordance with Ovako's definitions, borrowing costs are capitalised for capital expenditures amounting to at least E U R 20 million and which are expected to take at least 12 months to complete. There were no capital expenditures in 2012 (2011: None) for which bor rowing costs were capitalised. The cost of self-constructed assets includes expenditures for materials, direct payroll costs and a reasonable share of production-related overheads. To the extent assets consist of components with material differences in useful lives, they are depreciated separately using `component depreciation'. Expenditures for major repairs and main tenance are included in the carrying amount of the asset and depreciated over the remaining useful life to the extent they increase the economic benefit derived from the asset. Customary expenditures for repairs and maintenance are recognised as an expense as incurred. Items o f property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset to an estimated residual value. Estimated useful lives are:
