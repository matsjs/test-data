Financing agreement
In conjunction with the change of ownership in 2010, Ovako Group AB and subsidiaries entered into a new financing agree ment totalling EUR 385 million. The agreement includes two loans, originally of EUR 100 million (Facility A, which matures in Sep
tember 2015) and of EUR 210 million (Facility B, which matures in September 2016), plus a revolving credit facility of EUR 75 million. EUR 5 million of the revolving credit has been set aside for bank guarantees. Facility A is amortised over the term of the loan, both through voluntary repayments and in accordance with the terms of the loan, while Facility B matures in full in September 2016.
At year-end the liability for Facility A amounted to EUR 42.0 (57.1) million, and the liability for Facility B amounted to EUR 210.0 (210.0) million. In addition, EUR 20 (0) million of the revolving credit has been utilised, which means that total utilised credit at 31 December therefore amounted to EUR 272.0 (267.1) million. EUR 4.3 (3.8) of the revolving credit facility was set aside in the form of issued bank guarantees, which means the unutilised facility amounts to EUR 50.7 (71.2) million.
