The decrease in our net sales in the Nordics was primarily driven by decreases in our net sales in Sweden and Finland, which are our largest markets in the Nordics. The decreases in our net sales in Western Europe (excluding the Nordics) were primarily driven by decreases in Germany, the United Kingdom and France, which are our main markets in Western Europe. The decrease of our net sales in Germany was slightly lower than our decrease in net sales in Sweden, which reflects a later start of the economic recovery in Sweden.
