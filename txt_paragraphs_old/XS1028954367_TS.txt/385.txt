Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in a violation of applicable law or any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary that, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through measures reasonably available to the Parent or the Restricted Subsidiary.
Payments for consent
The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture, to exclude holders of Notes in any jurisdiction where (A)(i) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (ii) the payment of the consideration therefor would require the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its member states), which the Parent in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (B) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.
