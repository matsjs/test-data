Pension benefit assumptions
Pension benefits obligations are based on actuarial valuations. A discount rate is used to measure the present value of the defined benefit obligation. The rate should correspond to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds or, if no deep market in corporate bonds exists, govern ment bonds (see also `Employee benefits'concerning determination of the discount rate for Swedish pension benefits obligations). These assumptions are assessed at least once a year for all plans in each country. Other assumptions, which may relate to demographic factors such as age of retirement, mortality rates and employee turnover, are reviewed less frequently and usually based on public statistics in each country.
Valuation o f inventories
Valuations o f inventories contain estimates o f net realisable value and assumptions pertaining to cost distribution and normal capacity, which may affect the carrying amount.
Business combinations Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost is calculated as the sum of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition-date fair value and the value of any non-control ling influence in the acquiree, either at fair value or proportionate share of identifiable net assets in the acquiree. Acquisition and transaction costs are recognised as they arise as either an operating expense or a finance expense, depending on the nature of the expense. See Note 2 Business combinations for details of acquisitions during the reporting period.
