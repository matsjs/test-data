Net sales. Net sales in 2013 decreased by EUR87.2 million, or 9.3%, from EUR937.1 million in 2012 to EUR849.9 million in 2013. The decrease in net sales in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to the decrease in our sales volume from 694 kt in 2012 to 675 kt in 2013 and reduced scrap and alloy surcharges as a result of a decrease in raw material prices. In addition, an adverse shift in product mix and a slightly negative base price trend also negatively impacted our net sales in 2013.
The decrease in sales volume in 2013 was attributable to the period from January to August, reflecting the continuing uncertainty in the economic conditions. In addition, a fire at our manufacturing facility at Imatra in May 2013 resulted in a production stop for approximately six weeks, which also contributed to the decrease in our sale volume. In 2012, we also experienced a fire at Imatra, which resulted in a production stop for approximately five weeks. Our sales volume started to increase again in September 2013 resulting in higher sales volumes in September, October, November and December of 2013 compared to the corresponding periods in 2012, which partially offset lower sales volumes in the first eight months of 2013. We believe that the increase in demand from September 2013 was primarily driven by a combination of a more positive economic outlook and our initiatives to grow revenue. Our order intake in 2013 increased by approximately 10%, compared to 2012.
