CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The group is geographically divided into six sales territories as shown on the following table. The group had no revenues prior to acquisition of the Ovako companies on 29 September 2010. Accordingly, the disclosures in the table for 2010
refer only to the period thereafter. Segment reporting in accordance with IFR S 8 is not provided because this is not mandatory for entities whose shares are not publicly traded. The
presentation below was therefore prepared as required under the Swed ish Annual Accounts Act.
