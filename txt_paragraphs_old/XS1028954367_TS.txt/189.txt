Cost of goods sold in the first quarter of 2014 increased by EUR11.1 million, or 5.5%, from EUR203.2 million in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR214.3 million in the first quarter of 2014. The increase in our cost of goods sold mainly reflected increased consumption of raw materials as a result of higher sales volume, which was partially offset by lower raw materials prices. The increases in the costs for supplies and freight and distribution costs were also mainly driven by the increased sales volume in the first quarter of 2014. The cost impact of higher energy consumption, driven by higher sales, in the first quarter of 2014 was partially offset by a lower average spot price for electricity in the first quarter of 2014 and reduced electricity costs as a result of our new electricity prices hedging policy. The increase in demand and sales volume led to an increase in our inventory volumes, which was the key reason for the increase in the positive impact of changes in inventories and work in progress to EUR9.2 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to EUR5.2 million in the first quarter of 2013.
Selling expenses. Our selling expenses increased by EUR0.2 million, or 3.7%, from EUR5.4 million in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR5.6 million in the first quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to our strengthened sales presence in China and Italy.
Administrative expenses. Our administrative expenses increased by EUR0.3 million, or 3.4%, from EUR8.7 million in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR9.0 million in the first quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to salary inflation.
Other operating income. Our other operating income increased by EUR0.2 million, or 25%, from EUR0.8 million in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR1.0 million in the first quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to insurance compensation of EUR0.5 million in the first quarter of 2014 in relation to the fire at our Imatra mill in 2013, compared to the insurance compensation of EUR0.4 million in the first quarter of 2013.
Operating profit/(loss). As a result of the factors discussed above our operating profit increased by EUR14.3 million, or from EUR3.7 million in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR18.0 million in the first quarter of 2014.
