Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent priority in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Agent and holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral. See "Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on validity and enforceability o f the guarantees and security interests".
The Issuer is organized under the laws of Sweden and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Sweden, Finland and Germany. Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantors have assets in the United States, except for the shares in the subsidiary Ovako North America Inc. Some or all of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer may be non-residents of the United States and many of their assets will be located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or its directors and executive officers, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws. In addition, the Issuer cannot assure investors that civil liabilities predicated upon federal securities laws of the United States will be enforceable in Sweden. See "Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on validity and enforceability o f the guarantees and security interests".
The rights of the holders of the Notes to take enforcement action, including with respect to the liens securing the Notes, are limited and subject to collateral sharing arrangements.
The security interest in our assets serving as Collateral for the Notes and the Guarantees thereof will also be granted as collateral in favor of the lenders under any Pension Insurance Line, the
40
Revolving Credit Facility (and in certain circumstances, facilities that refinance the Revolving Credit Facility) and certain hedging counterparties. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture will also permit a security interest in such Collateral to be granted to lenders of additional debt and to hedging counterparties under certain of our hedging obligations. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will also serve as the Security Agent for the lenders under any Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility (and any applicable refinancing thereof), any additional secured debt and for certain hedge counterparties will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. In general, the lenders and the agent under any Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility and the representatives of our hedging counterparties and any agent with respect to any future secured debt will have, subject to prior notification of and consultation with the Trustee, the right to instruct the Security Agent to enforce the shared collateral. In addition, holders of the Notes will not be able to force a sale of the Collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the Security Documents without consulting the lenders and agents under any Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility (and any applicable refinancing thereof), certain hedge counterparties and any such other secured debt for so long as any amounts under any Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility (and any applicable refinancing thereof), certain hedging obligations or such other secured debt remain outstanding or as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the enforcement sale of any Collateral (or other sale of Collateral following a Distress Event) will be subject to, as a condition to the release of any claims of any other debt secured by such Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections intended to maximize the secured creditors' recovery from an enforcement sale. Prior to enforcement of the Collateral by any class of creditors, the other classes of creditors will be provided with notice and the delivery of any enforcement proposal will commence a 30-day consultation period (or such shorter period as may be agreed). Neither the Trustee, the Issuer nor the holders of the Notes will have the ability to prevent or delay enforcement after the relevant consultation periods have expired and, if required by the Intercreditor Agreement, consultation has occurred.
The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that a common security agent, who will also serve as the security agent for the lenders under any Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility (and any applicable refinancing thereof), our hedging obligations and any additional debt secured by the Collateral permitted to be incurred by the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement will regulate the ability of the Trustee or holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent will not be required to take enforcement action unless following the consultation period referred to above, it has received instructions from (i) creditors holding a majority of the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Notes, the non-priority hedging obligations and certain secured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes (the "Majority Senior Creditors"), (ii) if no such instructions have been received by Majority Senior Creditors at the expiration of the consultation period, the creditors holding more than 66 2/3% of the aggregate amount of indebtedness and commitments outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the priority hedging obligations (the "Majority Super Senior Creditors") and (iii) if no such instructions have been received from either the Majority Senior Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors at the expiration of the consultation period, the creditors holding more than 66 2/3% of the aggregate amount of indebtedness and commitments outstanding under the Pension Insurance Line, in each case acting through their respective creditor representative.
Although enforcement instructions given by the holders of the Notes (to the extent such holders hold a majority of the aggregate principal amount owed under the Notes, certain additional debt secured by the Collateral and certain hedging obligations) will prevail after such consultation period (other than in the case that it is determined, acting reasonably, that such delay would have a material adverse effect of the ability to enforce on the realization proceeds), if the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility (and any applicable refinancing thereof) and certain hedging obligations have not been fully discharged within six months of the date the first
