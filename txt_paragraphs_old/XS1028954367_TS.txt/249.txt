Engineering steel, like other steel products, is sold either directly to the final end-user or through a distributor or processors. Steel is also sold on either a contract, typically one year with monthly or quarterly scrap and alloy surcharge adjustments, or on a spot basis, involving a three month or less purchasing cycle, the latter being the typical purchasing pattern of distributors.
Logistics, freight costs including financing, and just-in-time delivery requirements are important factors limiting international geographic sales ranges primarily to each mill's immediate world region. For this reason, producers tend to significantly supply their immediate and regional markets.
The overall importance of logistics costs is also illustrated by the fact that the share of imports and exports into the EU's engineering steel market are of a similar magnitude. However, a key differentiating factor is that engineering steel imported into Europe is generally of more standardized grades while the engineering steel exported from the EU is mainly for use in more demanding applications that can be supplied by only a few European, American and Japanese producers. These end applications often tend to be the global production locations of multi national companies that require uniform and highest quality supply to their global locations, as well as increasingly select domestic producers of engineering goods in countries such as China or in South East Asia who seek to match in their products the performance of the western manufacturers.
The following chart shows a relatively stable pattern of EU imports of steel long products from 2008 to 2013 annually and from the first quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2013.
