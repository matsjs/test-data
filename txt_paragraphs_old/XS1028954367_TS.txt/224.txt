Comparison between the Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013. Net cash flows from operating activities was a net cash inflow of EUR5.0 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to a net cash outflow of EUR14.8 million in the first quarter of 2013. This increase was primarily due to our operating profit of EUR18.0 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to an operating profit of EUR3.7 million in the first quarter of 2013 and lower changes in working capital, which resulted in a cash outflow of EUR18.0 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to a cash outflow of EUR21.6 million in the first quarter of 2013.
Despite a considerably higher rate of production and increased delivery volumes, working capital for the first quarter of 2014 remained stable compared to the first quarter of 2013, but due to seasonality, working capital increased since December 31, 2013.
Net cash flows used in investing activities remained largely stable at EUR7.5 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to EUR7.4 million in the first quarter of 2013.

Net cash flows from financing activities amounted to a net cash inflow of EUR1.0 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to a net cash outflow of EUR5.4 million in the first quarter of 2013. The cash inflow from financing activities in the first quarter of 2014 was primarily due to a EUR10.0 million drawdown in the first quarter of 2014 under our revolving credit facility provided in our Senior Facilities Agreement to finance working capital, which was offset by higher repayments of borrowings of EUR9.0 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to a cash outflow of EUR5.4 million in the first quarter of 2013.
Comparison between the Years Ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Net cash flows from operating activities decreased by EUR67.1 million, or 77.2%, from EUR86.9 million in 2012 to EUR19.8 million in 2013. This decrease mainly resulted from an operating loss of EUR0.6 million in 2013, compared to an operating profit of EUR19.9 million in 2012, and changes in working capital, which resulted in a cash inflow in the amount of EUR53.8 million in 2012, compared to a cash outflow of EUR4.2 million in 2013. The significant cash inflow in 2012 as a result of changes in working capital was primarily due the significant decrease in sales volumes to 694 kt in 2012, compared to 851 kt in 2011, reflecting lower demand for our products as a result of the unfavorable economic environment, which led to decreases in trade receivables and inventories. In addition, in 2012, we were able to extend payment terms with suppliers, which was the key driver for the increase in trade payables in 2012. The positive impact on our cash flow from changes in working capital in 2012 was partially offset by an income tax payment in the amount of EUR15.2 million, compared to a tax credit of EUR0.1 million in 2013. In 2013, as a result of a lower decrease in sales volume from 694 kt in 2012 to 675 kt in 2013, the decreases in our trade receivables and inventories in 2013 were significantly lower than the decreases in 2012.
