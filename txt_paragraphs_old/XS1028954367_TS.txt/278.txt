IQ-Steel brand. IQ-Steel is our solution to the need for reliable components that can take the strain from higher and more complex load. IQ-Steel is characterized by a 40% increased fatigue strength, increased efficiency and weight reduction, in each case compared to traditional steels. Traditional steels are produced in a process where inclusions are crushed and elongated in the steel's rolling direction. As a result, they have poor fatigue and impact properties in the transverse rolling direction. IQ-Steel is produced in a process that eliminates most inclusions, resulting in clean steel with isotropic properties, meaning that it performs equally in all directions. Our IQ-Steel is primarily used to produce components for demanding applications in the automotive and transport segment (e.g., in diesel injection systems) and in the power generation segment by the wind power industry, but the steel is versatile and we are developing other applications together with customers.
WR-Steel brand. WR-Steel stands for "Wear Resistant Steel". WR-Steel describes steels we have developed based on our experience in boron grades and quenching and tempering processes. WRSteel utilizes excellent yield and tensile strength and greatly improved wear resistance for demanding environments. The Boron alloying in WR-Steel, even in small qualities, significantly increases hardenability, allowing lower contents of carbon and other alloying elements. WR-Steel is widely used in varied high demanding wear applications from yellow goods/construction equipment to agricultural, forestry and off-road vehicles. WR-Steel is used for components that are exposed abrasive conditions, such as snowplows, excavator teeth, and wheel chains for forestry equipment.

Our products
In the engineering steel segment, customers do not order standard products, but rather they approach us with an engineering idea that then requires the collaboration between the client and our sales and engineering team to identify the grade of material and product shape and finishing that best meets the customers requirements, based on the customer's production process and the product's end use. See and "--Customers" and "Industry". Because we produce over 10,000 different rolled or forged shapes and can apply several thousand combinations of value added services to those shapes to meet the needs of our customers, our products are best categorized by material, format and finishing.
We have more than 300 active feasible steel grades for making materials, of which 110 make up more than 80% of the volumes, across our three main production flows (Hofors-Hallefors, Smedjebacken-Boxholm and Imatra) (see "--Operations--Ovako's production flow"). As described above, most of our sales volumes may be sold under our five product brands. Our production facilities use these steel grades to produce more than 10,000 different rolled or forged shapes for customers, 2,400 of which comprised approximately 80% of our volume in 2013. Additionally, we offer several thousand different combinations of value added services options to our customers through the operations of our different facilities, including, heat treatment, turning, grinding, cutting, warehousing and transportation, and finished product and logistics-based tailoring of products to fit the start of our customers' production processes.
Format range. Our five main production facilities (of which three are facilities with on-site EAFs and rolling/forging mills, and two are rolling or forging mills without on-site EAFs) and six processing facilities allow us to cover an extensive format range. We can therefore provide most formats common to engineering steel. Our strategy of focusing on highly specialized products has lead to recent success such as deliveries to Indonesia and Malaysia and recently our first orders from a domestic Chinese manufacturer who seeks to benefit from the high quality that Ovako's products bring in these specialized applications.
The following table sets forth the main formats, ranges and the end markets of our products:
