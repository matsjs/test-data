Capital expenditure in 2011 amounted to EUR14.6 million of expansion capital expenditure and EUR18.9 million of maintenance capital expenditure. Unlike 2013 and 2012, maintenance capital expenditure in 2011 did not include replacements investments due to fires. Our expansion capital expenditure in 2011 included the following specific projects:
· EUR2.7 million in connection with our new ring mill in Hofors to cater for the increase we expect in demand for large rings for power generation, including wind mills.
· EUR1.3 million in connection with our new automated peeling line at our rolling mill in Hällefors to meet expected long-term growing demand for diesel injection systems in IQ-steel.
· EUR0.3 million in connection with the comprehensive modernization of our tube mill in Hofors to reduce personnel, energy costs and improve yield.
The remaining expansion capital expenditure of EUR10.4 million related to other strategic growth and cost saving investments.
We estimate that, in the medium term, our total capital expenditure will be between approximately EUR25 million and EUR35 million per year, of which between approximately EUR15 million and EUR20 million per year is expected to be attributable to maintenance capital expenditure to maintain the current state of our operations.
