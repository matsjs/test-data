Settlement
Other activities and relationships
Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment banking, commercial banking and other financial advisory and commercial dealings with us and our associates. They have received (or will receive) customary fees and commissions for these transactions. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are mandated lead arrangers of and will be lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. We expect that Nordea Bank AB (publ), an affiliate of Nordea Danmark A/S, will act as mandated lead arranger and facility agent under our new Revolving Credit Facility.
In addition, per December 31, 2013, Nordea Bank AB (publ) owned profit participating debentures issued by Triako Holdco AB in the amount of EUR9,813,880 (representing 87.25% of the total outstanding amount thereof). Triako Holdco AB is the direct shareholder of the Parent Company and not a part of the restricted group of companies.
We intend to use part of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to repay in full our obligations under our Senior Credit Facilities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are

lenders under our existing Senior Credit Facilities including Nordea Bank AB (publ), which also acts as mandated lead arranger, facility agent and security agent under our Senior Facilities Agreement and will therefore receive part of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. In addition, Nordea Bank AB (publ) will act as mandated lead arranger, agent and lender under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and agent and issuing bank under the Original Pension Insurance Line.
