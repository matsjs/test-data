 consolidate or merge with other entities or sell substantially all of our assets; and
 impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.
Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. See "Description o f other indebtedness--Revolving Credit Facility" and "Description o f Notes-- Certain covenants". Despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants contained in the Indenture and the agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility and the Original Pension Insurance Line could materially affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions, raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise or grow in accordance with our strategy. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance our capital needs.
Additionally, our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will require us to maintain minimum Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) of EUR35 million, tested quarterly, and our ability to meet that financial test can be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. A breach of any of those covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under the agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, and the relevant lenders, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, could cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, and to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.
