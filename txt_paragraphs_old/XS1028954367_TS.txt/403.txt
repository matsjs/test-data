Judgment currency
The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer or a Guarantor under the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees is Euro. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than Euro in respect of the Notes (whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Parent, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by a Holder or by the Trustee in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will constitute a discharge of the Issuer and the Guarantors only to the extent of the Euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any event the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase.

These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the other obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder or the Trustee (other than a waiver of
