Beyond the foregoing, credit risks are associated with trade receivables. Exposure to credit risk in trade receivables is managed according to the principles set out in the Credit Management Rules and Guidelines established by group management. These rules require, among else, that 99% of annual sales must be covered by credit insurance. A credit limit is established for each customer, which is set by the company's insurance company or internal credit control. Credit risk in trade receivables is man aged primarily through credit risk insurance. Credit risk is also reduced through bank guarantees, advance and cash payment requirements and letters of credit. At year-end, approximately 95% of Ovako's outstanding trade receivables were covered by credit insurance. The five largest custom ers (groups including subsidiaries) account for approximately 30% of consolidated sales and trade receivables.
