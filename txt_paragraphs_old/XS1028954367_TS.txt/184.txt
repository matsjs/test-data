Net sales. Net sales in the first quarter of 2014 increased by EUR25.7 million, or 11.7%, from EUR220.2 million in the first quarter of 2013 to EUR245.9 million in the first quarter of 2014. The increase in our net sales in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013 was mainly driven by the increase in our sales volume by 19.8% from 170.1 kt in the first quarter of 2013 to 203.7 kt in the first quarter of 2014. The lower increase in our net sales relative to the increase in our sales volume was due to lower scrap and alloy surcharges as a consequence of lower raw materials prices.
The increase in our sales volume in the first quarter was the result of both higher production rates among our customers as a result of improving economic conditions and new business won during 2013. The proportion of orders with short lead times remains relatively high, and we

believe that our customers' inventory levels have not increased significantly. Our order intake strengthened slightly in the first quarter, with an improvement of approximately 9% compared to the same period in 2013.
