The Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Notes and the Guarantees are being offered and sold only (i) to "qualified institutional buyers" (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) ("QIBs") in compliance with Rule 144A and (ii) to persons other than U.S. persons (as defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act) ("Foreign Purchasers") in offshore transactions (as defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act) in compliance with Regulation S.
In addition, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the Offering and the closing date of this Offering an offer or sale of the Notes (including the Guarantees) within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A.

(ii) a Foreign Purchaser purchasing the Notes outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.
(2) it is purchasing the Notes (including the Guarantees) for its own account or an account with respect to which it exercises sole investment discretion: in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any state securities laws and it and any such account (i) is a QIB, and is aware that the sale to it is being made in reliance on Rule 144A or (ii) is a Foreign Purchaser and is aware that the sale is being made in accordance with Regulation S;
