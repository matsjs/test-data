Global long engineering steel market
The market for long engineering steel products worldwide is estimated to be in excess of 40 million tons of which eight to ten million tons is based in Europe, six to eight million tons in North America, two million tons in South America, Africa, the Middle East, and 18 million tons in Asia led by China, Japan, South Korea and India.
Long engineering steel products, therefore, represent about 3% of all steel mill products produced and consumed in the world. In 2013, world crude steel production was 1,656 million tons, while world finished steel consumption was 1,425 million tons. The following chart shows the major long alloy engineering steel product producers in the world (as measured for alloyed steels only and including wire).
