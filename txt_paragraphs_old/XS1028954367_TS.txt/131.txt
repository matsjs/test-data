 requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt instead of operations, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, and other general corporate purposes;
 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged as us;
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and industry;
 restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;
52
 limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries' ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings;
 exposing us to risks that are inherent in interest rate fluctuations because certain of our indebtedness bears variable rates of interest; and
 subjecting us to restrictive covenants, including, in the case of our Revolving Credit Facility, financial covenants, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, our indebtedness.
We primarily expect to use cash flow from operations and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to finance our operations, service our indebtedness and fund capital expenditures. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in us being unable to service or repay indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet our other obligations and commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose. We cannot assure you that such refinancing or asset disposals could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments.
