(11) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture that are fair to the Parent or the Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the members of the Board of Directors of the Parent or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person;
(13) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Transaction; and

Designation of restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries
The Board of Directors of the Parent may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption " -- R estricte d p a ym en ts" or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Parent. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Parent may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Parent as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officer's Certificate certifying that such designation complied
173
with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption " --R estricte d p a ym en ts". If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption " -- Incu rrence o f In d e b te d n e ss a n d issuance o f p re fe r re d sto c k ", the Parent will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Parent may at anytime designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; p ro v id e d that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption " --Incurrence o f In d e b te d n e ss and issuance o f p re fe rre d sto c k ", calculated on a p ro form a basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
