In this offering memorandum we present percentage changes in our order intake. Customers typically purchase products from us on a purchase order basis and may increase, reduce and, in some instances, cancel their orders. Due to the nature of the end market we serve, our customary arrangements also permit customers to delay orders. The changes in our order intake presented in this offering memorandum are therefore subject to any such adjustments.

The following table sets forth, for the periods and dates indicated, the period average, high and low Bloomberg Composite Rates expressed in US$ per EUR1.00, SEK per EUR1.00 and SEK per US$1.00, as applicable. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a "best market" calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. On May 15, 2014, the Bloomberg Composite Rates were US$1.3707 per EUR1.00, SEK9.0109 per EUR1.00 and SEK6.5742 per US$1.00, respectively.
