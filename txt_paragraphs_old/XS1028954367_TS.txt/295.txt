We focus on direct sales to our customers, using third party distributors to complete our reach to certain target customers. For the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 85% of our sales were made directly to our customers, with the remaining approximately 15% accounting for third party distributors.
We have dedicated local sales forces in each of our key demographic markets, which consist of dedicated sales teams and local engineering resources. This enables us to have direct interaction with customers and provide our customers with access to a dedicated application development team. We also appoint key account managers for multi-product and multi-location customers to provide them with a central interface. We believe in profit accountability at the geographic market level, and the sales unit manager in each such market is responsible for our total business within that market. Our total sales-force for the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted of 95 full time employees. The following table shows the breakdown of our sales-force by geography.
