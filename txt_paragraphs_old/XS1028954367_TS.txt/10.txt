Notice to certain European investors
In relation to each member state of the EEA which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a "Relevant Member State"), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the "Relevant Implementation Date"), no offer has been made and no offer will be made of the Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State prior to the publication of a prospectus in relation to the Notes that has been approved by the competent authority in that Relevant Member State or, where appropriate, approved in another Relevant Member State and notified to the competent authority in that Relevant Member State, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive, except that, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, an offer of the Notes may be made to the public in that Relevant Member State at any time:
· to any legal entity which is a "qualified investor" as defined in the Prospectus Directive;
· to fewer than 100 or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the relevant provision of the 2010 PD Amending Directive, 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive) in any Relevant Member State subject to obtaining the prior consent of the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers; or
· in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,
provided that no such offer of Notes shall result in a requirement for the publication by the Issuer, any Guarantor or any Initial Purchaser of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.
For the purposes of this provision, the expression an "offer of Notes to the public" in relation to any Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes, as such expression may be varied in the Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State.
v
Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a Relevant Member State will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a "qualified investor" within the meaning of Article 2(1)(e) of the Prospectus Directive. The Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement. Notwithstanding the above, a person who is not a qualified investor and who has notified the Initial Purchasers of such fact in writing may, with the consent of the Initial Purchasers, be permitted to subscribe for or purchase the Notes in the Offering.
