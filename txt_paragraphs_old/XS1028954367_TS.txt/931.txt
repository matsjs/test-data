Impairment testing
Pension benefit assumptions
Pension benefit obligations are based on actuarial valuations. A discount rate is used to measure the present value o f the defined benefit obligation. These assumptions are assessed at least once a year for all plans in each
country. Other assumptions, which may relate to demographic factors such as age of retirement, mortality rates and employee turnover, are reviewed less frequently and usually based on public statistics in each country.
Valuation o f inventories
Valuations of inventories contain estimates of net realisable value and assumptions pertaining to cost distribution and normal capacity, which may affect the carrying amount.
Business combinations Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost is calculated as the sum of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition-date fair value and the value of any non-controlling influence in the acquiree, either at fair value or proportionate share of identifiable net assets in the acquiree. Acquisition and transaction costs are recognised as they arise as either an operating expense or a finance expense, depending on the nature o f the expense.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company Ovako Group AB and all companies in which the parent directly or indirectly holds more than 50% ofvoting rights or, on another basis, directly or indirectly exerts controlling influence.
Equity holdings in subsidiaries have been eliminated using the acquisi tion method. The financial statements of group companies are incorpo rated in the consolidated financial statements as of the date the group obtains control over the acquiree until such control ceases. Intra-group transactions, receivables, liabilities, unrealised gains and intra-group dividends are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are eliminated only to the extent there is no evidence of impairment loss.
