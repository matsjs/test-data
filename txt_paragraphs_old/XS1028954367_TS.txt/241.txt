The Restricted Group may further enter into any additional Pension Insurance Line Agreement (an "Additional Pension Insurance Line Agreement") pursuant to which pension liabilities of the Restricted Group are guaranteed provided that:
(ii) the relevant Pension Insurance Line Agreement does not contain any financial covenant; and
(iii) the lenders and other finance parties to the relevant Pension Insurance Line Agreement have acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement.
Any Pension insurance Line under such Additional Pension Insurance Line Agreement (an "Additional Pension Insurance Line") will rank pari passu with the Original Pension Insurance Line and will benefit from a first-ranking, super senior security interest in the Collateral.
Any Pension Insurance Line may be refinanced, and Additional Pension Insurance Lines may be put in place, to increase commitments up to the amount of our pension liability at the time of such increase. Pension liabilities supported or guaranteed by any Pension Insurance Line will be subject to certain restrictions under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Original Pension Insurance Line Agreement.
In addition, no member of the Group may incur any pension liabilities supported or guaranteed by a Pension Insurance Line to the extent that such pension liabilities result from:
(a) an acquisition of a business or undertaking;
(b) the entry by a member of the Group into a joint venture; or
