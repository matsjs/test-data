(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or Clearstream following an "Event of Default" under and as defined in the Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.
In any such event described in clauses (1) or (2), we will instruct the Registrar to issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or us, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and certain certification requirements and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of the Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.
To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.
The Registrar will send a copy of the register to the Issuer on the Issue Date and after any change to the register of holders of the Notes made by the Registrar, with such copy to be held by the Issuer and at its registered office.
We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.
So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Issuer will publish a notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in a newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Lu xem b u rg er W ort). Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at the office of the paying agent so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Redemption of the Global Notes
In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream (or its respective nominee), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The common depositary will surrender such Global Note to the Registrar for cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the common depositary will request the Registrar or the Trustee to mark down, endorse and return the applicable Global Note to reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such partial redemption. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at anytime, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their participants' accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate (including the pool factor); provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than EUR100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.
