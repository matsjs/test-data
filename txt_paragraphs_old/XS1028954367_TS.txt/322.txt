(1) repayment in full of utilizations funded by, and cancellation of the commitments of, any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such lender to perform any of its obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility or to fund, issue or maintain its participation in any utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility;
(3) immediately following a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Restricted Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions if we choose to prepay such proceeds; and
(4) if we repay more than EUR90.0 million (plus the amount of any additional shareholder funding made available for that purpose) or 50%, of the aggregate principal amount of the notes (and any replacement debt) as at the date of the agreement we need to cancel a pro rata amount of the commitments in respect of the Pension Insurance Line and the Revolving Facility (and repay a pro rata amount of any loans outstanding under such facilities).
The Parent Company must comply with a minimum EBITDA test (whereby the Consolidated EBITDA shall not be less than EUR35.0 million), which is tested quarterly on a rolling twelve month basis provided that, if the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the ancillary facilities are not utilized or, if utilized, are fully cash collateralized, during the last 10 days of the relevant testing period, a failure to comply with the minimum EBITDA test will not result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Parent Company may cure a breach of the minimum EBITDA test by procuring the contribution of additional equity funding, in cash. 50% of the amount of such additional equity funding will be included in the Parent Company's consolidated EBITDA for purposes of testing compliance with the minimum EBITDA covenant. The equity cure may not be used more than two times during the life of the Revolving Credit Facility, and may not be used more than once in any fiscal year. We will be unable to draw new money under the Revolving Credit Facility if we were not in compliance with the minimum EBITDA requirement when it was last tested.
Our Group is subject to certain restrictive and, as the case may be, affirmative covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement customary for this type of financing, subject to certain specified exceptions and/or qualifications (customized to our business and adjusted to our current credit standing). These restrictive and affirmative covenants largely replicate those covenants which apply under the Notes subject to certain agreed amendments and exceptions, but also provide for further customary restrictive and affirmative covenants. The covenants include,

among other things, (i) compliance with law (including environmental laws anti-corruption laws); (ii) maintaining adequate insurance; (iii) ensuring compliance with pension liabilities; and (iv) compliance with the Guarantor Threshold Test. There are also restrictions on our ability to (i) purchase the Notes (ii) incur financial indebtedness; (iii) conduct certain activities at the Parent Company level; and (iv) pay dividends and make investments (together the "Restrictive Covenants").
Additionally, under the Revolving Credit Facility we have the obligation to provide certain financial information and other information regarding our financial condition to the lenders, such information to be provided monthly, quarterly and annually (the "Information Undertakings").
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement sets out certain events of default which are customary for such type of financing. The events of default include (i) non-payment; (ii) breach of the minimum EBITDA test; (iii) insolvency; (iv) insolvency proceedings; (iv) cross-default in relation to the Notes and the Pension Insurance Line; and (v) subject to a materiality threshold of EUR5.0 million in aggregate, a cross default in relation to certain other financial indebtedness of the Restricted Group (the "Event of Default Provisions"). The occurrence of any such event of default would, subject to any applicable grace periods, cure rights or agreed exceptions, entitle the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility to cancel their commitments, declare that all or part of the loans (together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued or outstanding in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility (including any Additional Facility)) be immediately due and payable or payable on demand.
