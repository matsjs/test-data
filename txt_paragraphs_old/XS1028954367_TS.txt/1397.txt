PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The differences between accounting policies applied to the parent company and the group are attributable to limitations on the application of IFRSs for the parent company under the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the Swedish Pension Obligations Vesting Act and, to a certain extent, for tax reasons. The parent company applies the Swedish Financial Accounting Board's recommendation RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Enti ties. The differences in accounting policies between the parent and that group had no effect on the financial statements at 31 December 2011.
