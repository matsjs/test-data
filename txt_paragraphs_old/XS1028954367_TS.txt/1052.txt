Financing agreement In conjunction with the change of ownership in 2010, Ovako Group AB and subsidiaries entered into a new financing agreement totalling EU R 385 million. The agreement includes two loans, originally of EU R 100 million (Facility A, which matures in September 2015) and of EU R 210 million (Facility B, which matures in September 2016), plus a revolving credit facility of EU R 75 million. E U R 5 million of the revolving credit has been set aside for bank guarantees. Facility A is amortised over the term of the loan, both through voluntary repayments and in accordance with the terms o f the loan, while Facility B matures in full in September 2016.
At year-end the liability for Facility A amounted to E U R 57.1 (86.0) million, and the liability for Facility B amounted to E U R 210.0 (210.0) million. Total unutilised credit at 31 December therefore amounted to
E U R 267.1 (296.0) million. E U R 3.8 million of the revolving credit was utilised in the form of issued bank guarantees, which means the unutilised facility amounts to E U R 71.2 (75.0) million.
The interest rate for the loans is the average annual IBO R plus lending margin. Under the terms of the loan, the company must ensure compliance with financial covenants based on cash flow, interest coverage ratio, leverage in relation to E B IT D A and capital expenditures. The company was in compliance with all covenants at the reporting date. A ll shares in large group subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral for the loans. In addition, the subsidiaries have issued property mortgages and floating charges. See also Note 29. Arrangement fees were paid in conjunction with the drawdown. Arrangement costs are amortised over the term of the loan and recognised as a reduction of interest-bearing-liabilities.
