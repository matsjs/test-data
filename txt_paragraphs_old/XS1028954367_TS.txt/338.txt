The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent and the Subsidiary Guarantors (subject to the guarantee limitations contained in the Indenture). The initial Subsidiary Guarantors will be each of Ovako Sweden AB, Ovako Bright Bar AB, Ovako Forsbacka AB, Ovako Bar AB, Triako Finco AB, Ovako GmbH (Germany), Ovako Finland Oy Ab (Finland) and Ovako Imatra Oy Ab (Finland). The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor:
 will be a general obligation of that Guarantor;
 will be secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral, but will receive proceeds from enforcement of security over the Collateral or otherwise from the Collateral, only after any obligations secured on a super priority basis. Such obligations include obligations under the Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;
 will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by Liens senior to the Liens securing such Note Guarantee or secured by property or assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;
 will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee, including Indebtedness incurred under the Pension Insurance Line, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;
 will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; and
 will be effectively senior to all of such Guarantor's existing and future unsecured Indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing such Note Guarantee.
Certain of the Note Guarantees will be limited in value and subject to certain contractual or other limitations or subordinated under German or other applicable law. These limitations are generally related to local corporate or other law. See " Risk factors--Risks relating to an investment in the Notes and the Guarantees--The Guarantees and security interests on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability".
