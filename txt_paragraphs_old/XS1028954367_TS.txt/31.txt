This offering memorandum contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the securities laws of certain applicable jurisdictions, including Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21 E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us, and include, without limitation, statements regarding our business, financial condition, strategy, results of operations, certain of our plans, objectives, assumptions, expectations, prospects and beliefs and statements regarding other future events or prospects. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words "aim", "anticipate", "assume", "believe", "contemplate", "continue", "could", "estimate", "expect", "plan", "intend", "seek", "predict", "potential", "may", "will", "should", "strive", "shall", "risk" or, in each case, the negative of these terms or similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and future trends. Others can be identified from the context in which the statements are made.
Forward-looking statements appear in a number of places in this offering memorandum. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the development of the industry in which we operate and the effect of acquisitions on us may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the development of the industry in which we operate and the effect of acquisitions on us are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.
Factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this offering memorandum include but are not limited to the risks described under "Risk factors". For example, factors that could cause actual results to vary from projected results include, but are not limited to:
 the performance of the global economy and the economic performance of the jurisdictions in which we operate, in particular our key markets;
 the cyclicality of the industries in which we operate;
 the intense competition in the industries in which we operate, which could reduce our revenue or put continued pressure on our sales prices;
 our dependence on the end markets of our customers;
 our dependence on a concentrated number of jurisdictions;
