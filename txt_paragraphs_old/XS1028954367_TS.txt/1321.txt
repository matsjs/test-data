Market risk - interest rate risk Interest rate risk refers to the risk that changes in market rates will have adverse impact on consolidated net financial income.
The group's consolidated interest rate exposure is managed by Group Treasury.Total external loan debt at year-end was EU R 296 (310) million.
The group's finance policy is to hedge at least 2/3 of the fixed rate term on the total debt portfolio over a three-year period. At 31 December 2011, the group had two interest rate swaps with a total value of EU R 270 million at fixed rates, which will mature in 2013 (EUR 120m) and 2014 (EUR 150m).
Assuming the loan debt is unchanged at the end of the year, a change in market interest rates of 100 points (1 percent) would impact net financial income by EU R 0.3 million.
Credit and counterparty risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations.
The group is exposed to credit and counterparty risk against financial counterparties when funds are deposited, when positive cash balances are maintained with banks and when financial derivatives are acquired. These risks are minimised by contracting only with financially stable banks or other counterparties.
Beyond the foregoing, credit risks are associated with trade receiv ables. Exposure to credit risk in trade receivables is managed according to the principles set out in the Credit Management Rules and Guidelines established by group management. These rules require, among else, that 99% of annual sales must be covered by credit insurance.
A credit limit is established for each customer, which is set by the company's insurance company or internal credit control. Credit risk in trade receivables is managed primarily through credit risk insurance. Credit risk is also reduced through bank guarantees, advance and cash payment requirements and letters of credit.
