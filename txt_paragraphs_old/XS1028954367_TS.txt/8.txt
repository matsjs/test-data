The Issuer accepts responsibility for the information contained in this offering memorandum. The Issuer declares that, having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case, the information contained in this offering memorandum is, to the best of its knowledge, in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of this offering memorandum.
Stabilization
IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES, J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES PLC (THE "STABILIZING MANAGER") (OR ANY PERSON ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING MANAGER) MAY OVER-ALLOT NOTES OR EFFECT TRANSACTIONS WITH A VIEW TO SUPPORTING THE MARKET PRICE OF THE NOTES AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE PREVAIL. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE STABILIZING MANAGER (OR ANY PERSON ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING MANAGER) WILL UNDERTAKE STABILIZATION ACTION. ANY STABILIZATION ACTION MAY BEGIN ON OR AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH ADEQUATE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE TERMS OF THE OFFER OF THE NOTES IS MADE AND, IF BEGUN, MAY BE ENDED AT ANY TIME, BUT IT MUST END NO LATER THAN THE EARLIER OF 30 DAYS AFTER THE ISSUE DATE OF THE NOTES AND 60 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THE ALLOTMENT OF THE NOTES.
Notice to investors
The Issuer expects that the delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified in the last paragraph on the front cover of this offering memorandum, which will be the fifth business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred to as "T+5"). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act") trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle T+5, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days should consult their advisors.
