(2) EBITDA is defined as operating profit (loss) for the period before depreciation, amortization and impairments. EBITDA reflects the impact of charges resulting from matters that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations. We also present Adjusted EBITDA, where we add back restructuring costs. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins are defined as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of our net sales. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. Accordingly, they should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit as indicators of our performance, or as alternatives to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used by our management to monitor our performance and we believe that these measures are commonly used by investors. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in this offering memorandum, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these measures are calculated.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated as follows.
