Scrap collection and selection. Unlike the carbon steel industry, which uses iron ore, melted down
in blast furnaces powered by coal, in the engineering steel industry we rely primarily on specially selected scrap metal, which is supplemented by separately purchased alloys to produce the correct combination of elements when melting down the metal to produce our steel. The key activities for this stage of the process are sourcing, collecting and sorting the scrap metal in order to prepare each melt in a scrap basket. Using our metallurgical expertise, we are able to determine the alloy content and fragmentation of different scrap categories to ensure the proper mix in a given melt.
Metallurgy (EAF melting, LFT and vacuum degassing). Once the scrap has been selected, all our
production flows begin at one of our three electric arc furnaces (EAFs) located in Hofors, Imatra and Smedjebacken. Primary metallurgy is the production of a basic melt at one of our EAFs. Our use of an EAF based platform allows us to operate a flexible business model, which can react rapidly to changing customer demands and macroeconomic conditions. Our mills can be shut down and restarted with relatively low restart and maintenance costs compared to blast furnaces

Our EAF technology is based on the recycling of scrap material, which reduces our direct exposure to iron and coal prices while providing environmental benefits compared to blast furnaces.
