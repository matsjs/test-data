Defined benefit plans: The largest plan, which accounts for approximately 90% of the group's pension liabilities in the balance sheet, is the Swedish plan secured in the Swedish PRI/FPG system. The average maturity of this liability is approximately 15 years. In addition, the UK subsidiary has a funded defined benefit pension and life assurance plan that was closed to new subscribers as of 31 December 2009. This plan continues to have a deficit and payments are being made to the fund as planned. Other smaller plans include a plan for senior executives (current and former) in Germany, which is also closed to new subscriptions, and a plan for medical and drug costs for certain employees and former employees in the USA.
