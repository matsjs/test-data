Capital expenditure in 2013 amounted to EUR21.0 million of expansion capital expenditure and EUR23.9 million of maintenance capital expenditure. Maintenance capital expenditure in 2013 also included replacements investments due to the fire at our steel mill in Imatra in August 2013. Excluding these replacement investments, our maintenance capital expenditure in 2013 was EUR20.5 million. Our expansion capital expenditure in 2013 included the following specific projects:
· EUR9.0 million in connection with a new state-of-the art de-dusting filter in Smedjebacken to meet future environmental requirements and to reduce the risk of business disruption.
· EUR5.2 million in connection with the comprehensive modernization of our tube mill in Hofors to reduce personnel, energy costs and improve yield.
· EUR2.0 million in connection with our new automated peeling line at our rolling mill in Hällefors to meet the increase we expect in demand for diesel injection systems in IQ-steel. This project was completed in 2013.
