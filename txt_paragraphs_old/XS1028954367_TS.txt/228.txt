The significant decreases in our inventories and trade receivables were primarily due to a significant decrease in our sales volumes to 694 kt in 2012, compared to 851 kt in 2011, reflecting lower demand for our products as a result of the unfavorable economic environment. As the drop in sales volume from 2012 to 2013 was less significant, our inventories and trade receivables decreased only slightly from 2012 to 2013. In 2012, we were able to extend payment terms with suppliers, which was the key driver for the increase in trade payables.
We have actively managed our trade working capital since 2011 in order to achieve what we believe is an efficient working capital cycle. For example, by extending payment terms with suppliers, our average days of outstanding trade payables increased from 26 days in 2011 to 35 days and 40 days in 2012 and 2013, respectively. At the same time, we were able to maintain a stable average days of trade receivables outstanding, which were 43 days, 42 days and 43 days in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. We also managed our inventory actively. Our average days of inventory outstanding were 88 days, 95 days and 94 days in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. This reflects our increased focus on inventory management and efficiency as we managed to keep our inventory level stable between 2012 and 2013 despite increased customer activity and rises in order volumes. During periods when we build up our inventory, for example in response to increases in demand for our products, our cash flow is negatively impacted but our results from operations are positively impacted. In 2012, our inventories decreased significantly, which was attributable to both the significant decrease in our sales volume in 2012 and our decision to actively manage our working capital. This contributed to a significant cash inflow but had a negative impact on our results of operations. The impact of changes in our inventories in 2013 was less significant, reflecting a lower decrease in sales volume compared to 2012 and inventory build up in the second half of the year reflecting increased demand for our products. In the first quarter of 2014, inventory volumes increased compared to the corresponding quarter of 2013, reflecting increased sales volume and higher production. Due to lower raw material prices in the first quarter of 2014, the value of our inventories on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2014 is slightly below the value of our inventories as of March 31, 2013.
Capital expenditures and investments
The following table sets forth our capital expenditures, which includes purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, for each of the periods indicated. We generally distinguish between expansion capital expenditure and maintenance capital expenditure. Expansion capital expenditure, according to our classification, includes strategic growth and cost savings investments as well as investments due to regulatory requirements.
