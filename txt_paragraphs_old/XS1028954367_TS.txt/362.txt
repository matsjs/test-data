(b) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;
(d) to purchase the Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (a "Notes Offer");
(e) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) not classified as current assets under IFRS that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; or
(f) any combination of the foregoing; or
(2) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Proceeds pursuant to clauses (b), (c) or (e) of paragraph (1) above; provided that such binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such acquisition or expenditure is consummated, and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365-day period.
Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Parent (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.
Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant will constitute "Excess Proceeds". Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, when the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds 20.0 million, within ten Business Days thereof, the Issuer will make an offer (an "Asset Sale Offer") to all holders of Notes and may make an offer to all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes or any Note Guarantees to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price for the Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof and the offer price for such pari passu Indebtedness will be no greater than 100% of the principal amount thereof, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption (and subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), and will be

payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into (or to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds or if the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered pursuant to a Notes Offer exceeds the amount of the Net Proceeds so applied, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness, if applicable, to be purchased on a pro rata basis or in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream (or in the manner described under "--Selection and notice"), based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in Euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into Euro equivalent determined as of the Business Day immediately prior to the date on which the Asset Sale Offer is announced. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.
