Industry and market data
We operate in a segment of the steel industry focused on mildly and highly alloyed steel, or so called "engineering steel", for which it is difficult to obtain precise industry and market information. In this offering memorandum we rely on and refer to certain economic information, information regarding our industry and information regarding the end markets in which we operate and compete. We have obtained this information from various third party sources, including providers of macroeconomic and industry data. Furthermore for the purpose of this offering memorandum we have commissioned and used a report prepared for us by Metal Strategies Inc. in 2014 (the "Metal Strategies Report"). In addition, certain information was obtained through discussions with our customers and from our own internal estimates.
While we believe that the economic and industry reports and publications we have used are reliable, they including the Metal Strategies Report have not been independently verified and therefore we do not assume responsibility for the accuracy of the information contained in them. To the extent that information was taken from third parties, we assume responsibility for the correct reproduction and extraction of such information. As far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information published or reported to us by these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. However, market studies and analyses are frequently based on information and assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct, and their methodology may be forward-looking and speculative. Additionally, industry and economic publications, reports, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in some instances state that they do not assume liability for such information. We and the Initial Purchasers cannot assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such information as we have not independently verified such information.
