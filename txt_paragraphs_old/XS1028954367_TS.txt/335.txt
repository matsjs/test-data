Other indebtedness to be repaid in connection with the transaction
Senior facility
In connection with the Ovako Group restructuring in 2010, a EUR385.0 million and SEK440.0 million senior facilities agreement dated August 10, 2010 was concluded between the Parent Company, certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries and Nordea Bank AB (publ) as the mandated lead arranger, original lender, agent and the security agent (the "Senior Facilities Agreement"). As of March 31, 2014, borrowings under the senior facilities amounted to EUR273.0 million. The facilities subject to the senior facilities agreement are a multicurrency revolving facility, euro term facility A, a euro term facility B and a guarantee facility.
Release of existing security
In connection with the Ovako Group restructuring in 2010, we granted guarantees and security interests over certain shares in the companies in the Ovako Group (including some of the Guarantors), real estate, floating charges, intra group loans, bank accounts and intellectual property rights, to secure the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement.
We expect to use a portion of the proceeds of this offering to repay all amounts outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement and to pay related transaction costs. Upon payment of such amounts, we expect all such security interests to be fully and unconditionally discharged and released.
