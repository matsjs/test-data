After melting the scrap, we optimize the grade specification by adding alloys and degassing the liquid steel. LFT treatment of the melted steel occurs in a ladle furnace, controlling for temperature and adding alloying elements. We use vacuum degassing in Hofors and Imatra, which is a process to remove impurities from the melt. The addition of alloys and degassing processes are used to produce differing product attributes, driven by the chemical composition of the melt. The value added at this step by Ovako is our ability to optimize the final product performance. In particular, we have an ability to limit inclusions for superior product (fatigue) properties.
Casting and soaking. After refining the liquid steel during the metallurgy step, the steel is solidified, either into ingots or through continuous casting or into billets or blooms. This is essentially casting liquid steel into semi-finished products at a controlled temperature. We use our knowledge of how different casting processes and sequences impact product performance and process efficiency. For our IQ-Steel and BQ-Steel product brands, a soaking period is then implemented to reach the required properties.
Hot rolling or forging. After the material is once again solid steel, whether in the form of billets, blooms or ingots, it then undergoes hot forming as a next step, either by rolling in a rolling mill or forging in a forging mill. Special microstructures (supported by chemical composition) can be flexibly adjusted by heat treatment of various kinds (under different atmospheres, at different temperature regimes, and duration) and during thermo-mechanically controlled rolling/forging. We use these processes to produce the sizes and shapes desired by the customer (see generally "--Our products"). Due to our experience and knowledge, we are able to minimize energy consumption through efficient processes limiting the amount of re-heating required.
Finishing. Using our knowledge of our customers' processes and the intended end use for our products, we produce finished products that are tailored to be incorporated directly into the start of our respective customers' processes, and that aim to increase our customers' efficiency and reduce their costs.
Ovako's production flow
Our manufacturing is traditionally based on three production flows: Hofors-Hallefors, Smedjebacken-Boxholm and Imatra. Together, these production flows enable us to offer and produce our valuable and competitive offering of products. Our operations are described based on the following three productions flows:
