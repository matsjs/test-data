The group applies hedge accounting for forward contracts related to electricity prices and interest rate swaps that meet the criteria defined in IAS 39. Changes in the value of hedging instruments that are part of an effective cash flow hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income and shown in the hedge reserve in equity, while hedge ineffectiveness is recognised immediately in profit and loss. The cumulative change in value of such derivatives is transferred to net profit or loss in the same period as the hedged item affects profit and loss.
Cash and bank balances Cash and bank balances include liquid bank balances and cash in hand as well as short-term bank deposits with a remaining maturity from acquisition date of three months or less.
