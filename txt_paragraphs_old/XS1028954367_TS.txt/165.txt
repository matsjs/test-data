Within the automotive and transportation sector, our exposure has been primarily to heavy trucks and construction equipment, which accounts for most of our revenue from the automotive and transportation sector, and to a lesser extent on passenger cars. Our results of operations have therefore been particularly affected by changes in the demand for trucks and construction equipment, which is more sensitive than demand for passenger cars to actual or expected changes in economic conditions generally and change in GDP specifically.
We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of our products, delivery performance and price. We sell a significant majority of our products to customers located in Europe. We depend on maintaining close geographical proximity between our mills and our customers because of the costs of transporting metals across large distances is high and because of the importance of close collaboration in engineering and flexible delivery times.
