(d) This represents the estimated impact of our new electricity hedging policy, as if such new hedging policy had been fully effective since April 1, 2013. We have implemented the following changes in our hedging policy: (i) two year electricity hedging horizon instead of a five year electricity hedging horizon; (ii) decrease of our electricity hedging from approximately 80% to 100% of our estimated consumption to approximately 40% to 60% of our estimated consumption; and (iii) use of quarterly hedges instead of yearly hedges. The calculation of our savings is based on (i) a neutral 50% hedge level for the current and coming quarter, (ii) actual market prices for quarterly forward electricity contracts quoted on NASDAQ OMX at the time we would have entered into the contracts, (iii) actual market prices five market days before quarter end, and (iv) our estimated electricity consumption. We believe these changes allow us to be more responsive to changes in the outlook for electricity prices and avoid historical over-hedging mainly in the third quarter of the year when our electricity consumption is typically lower.
(f) This does not take into account additional energy cost savings we expect to achieve as a result of certain investments made in the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 relating to the installation of a new temperature control system at Hofors and a new control system for one of our furnaces in SmeBox, which we expect to reduce our energy consumption. In addition, there are further investments, approved by our board as part of our 2014 budget, relating to the installation of a reheating furnace control system in Imatra, which are similarly expected to further reduce our energy consumption.
(3) Pro forma net financial debt reflects the total third party debt excluding finance lease liabilities, net of cash and cash equivalents of the Group, on a consolidated basis as of March 31, 2014 after giving effect to the Refinancing, including the issuance of the Notes and the use of proceeds thereof as contemplated under "Use o f Proceeds" as if it occurred on March 31, 2014. See "Use o f Proceeds" and "Capitalization".
(4) Pro forma interest expense for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 is calculated as interest expense adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing, including the issuance of the Notes and the use of proceeds thereof, as contemplated under "Use o f Proceeds" as if it occurred on April 1, 2013 and assuming that the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn and excluding the commitment fees under that facility and imputed interest expense on finance lease liabilities and financial income for such period. See "Use o f Proceeds" and "Capitalization".
