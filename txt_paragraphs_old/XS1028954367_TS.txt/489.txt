Secondary market trading
Special timing considerations
You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for business.
In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or in Brussels if Euroclear is used.
Clearing information
The Notes have been accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers and common codes for the Notes are set forth under "L istin g a n d G en eral In fo rm a tio n ".
Trustees' powers
In considering the interests of the holders of Notes, while title to the Notes is registered in the name of a nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Trustee may have regard to, and rely on, any information provided to it by those clearing systems as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its accountholders with entitlements to Notes and may consider such interests as if such accountholders were the holders of the Notes.
