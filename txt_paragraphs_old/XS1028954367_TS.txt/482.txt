Instead, Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, the respective book-entry registration and transfer systems maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of BookEntry Interests will not be considered the owners or "holders" of Notes for any purpose.
The Notes will be issued in denominations of EUR100,000 and in integral multiples of EUR1,000 in excess thereof.
None of us, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Trustee or any other of our other respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.
Definitive Registered Notes
Under the terms of the Indenture, to the extent permitted by Euroclear and Clearstream, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes only:
(1) if either Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days; or
242
(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or Clearstream following an "Event of Default" under and as defined in the Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.
Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described in the immediately preceding clause, their current procedure is to request that we issue, or cause to be issued, Definitive Registered Notes.
