Cost of goods sold in 2013 decreased by EUR63.1 million, or 7.3%, from EUR869.7 million in 2012 to EUR806.6 million in 2013. The decrease in cost of goods sold in 2013 mainly reflected decreases in raw material costs, costs related to changes in inventories and work in progress, energy costs, other operating costs, costs for supplies and freight and other distribution costs.
Our reduced raw materials costs in 2013 were mainly attributable to reduced prices for scrap and alloy and an improved optimization of our use of alloy contained in scrap, which reduced our costs for alloy. The impact of changes in inventories and work in progress on our cost of goods sold resulted in an increase of cost of goods sold by EUR2.6 million in 2013, compared to an increase of EUR15.9 million in 2012. The lower impact of changes in inventories and work in progress in 2013 was primarily due to the lower decrease in inventory volume in 2013. In 2012, our inventory volume decreased significantly reflecting both a significant decrease in sales volume and our decision to actively manage our working capital. The decrease in our energy expenses was the result of lower consumption of energy in 2013 and reduced electricity costs as a
