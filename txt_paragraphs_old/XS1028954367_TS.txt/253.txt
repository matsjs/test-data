Approximately 30% of all engineering steels is in larger sizes (over 90mm in diameter) and 10% is in the largest size range (over 150 mm in diameter) with only a limited number of producers worldwide in the largest size category.
The auto and truck sectors ultimately account for almost half of all engineering steels applications in Europe and most other global regions, although their relative share is declining moderately which provides a positive increase in diversification for engineering steel suppliers. Other key markets include forgings, industrial equipment, off-highway vehicles and energy. Imports are on the order of 5% to 10% of the market while exports are about the same volume and share of shipments.
European long engineering steel products market
Estimated annual average demand for long engineering steel products within the EU is between 6 and 10 million tons since 2008. Within Europe, most engineering steels are consumed in the main Western European continental countries led by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy. In Western Europe, the demand for heavy sizes, light vehicles grades and multipurpose and micro alloyed steel is approximately 1.7 kt, 1.3kt and 1.8 kt.
Engineering steel is a subset of total steel and, in turn, long product steel. The following table shows history and forecast of EU27 crude steel production and EU27 long product steel rolling mill output. At a recent trend average of 8 million tons (seen in 2010 and 2011), the long engineering steel products market in Europe represents 4% to 5% of total crude steel production and 10% to 15% of rolled long product steel output. The table below sets out historic changes in European crude steel production and hot-rolled long products production.
