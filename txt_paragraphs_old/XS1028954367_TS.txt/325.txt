The Intercreditor Agreement will also allow for a refinancing of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Pension Insurance Line, the Notes and any Pari Passu Debt. For the purposes of this description, any references to the Revolving Credit Facility, RCF Lenders, Credit Facility Liabilities (as defined below), Pension Insurance Line, PIL Lenders, Pension Insurance Line Liabilities (as defined below), Notes, Noteholders or Notes Liabilities (as defined below) should be read as including any such refinancing debt. With respect to any Pension Insurance Line, such refinancings may include increases in commitments and Additional Pension Insurance Lines being put into place up to the amount of our pension liability at the applicable time.
Ranking and priority
The Intercreditor Agreement will provide, subject to the provisions regarding permitted payments below, that all present and future liabilities and obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility (the "Credit Facility Liabilities"), the Pension Insurance Line (the "Pension Insurance Line Liabilities") the hedging agreements entered into by the Hedge Counterparties (the "Hedging Liabilities"), the Notes (the "Notes Liabilities") and the Pari Passu Debt will rank pari passu in right and priority of payment without any preference between them.
These liabilities will rank ahead of (i) any liabilities and obligations of the Debtors to the Parent Company and its subsidiaries (the "Intra-Group Liabilities"), and (ii) any shareholder debt (which consists of liabilities and obligations owed by any Debtor to any shareholder, direct or indirect, of the Parent Company) (the "Shareholder Liabilities" and, together with the Intra-Group Liabilities the "Subordinated Liabilities"). The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank the Subordinated Liabilities as between themselves.
Collateral
The RCF Lenders, the PIL Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties, the Noteholders and the Pari Passu Creditors (the "Secured Creditors") will benefit from a common security package (which will be subject to customary limitations on guarantees and security) and (subject to customary exceptions) no Creditor shall accept security unless such security is also, to the extent legally possible, at the same time granted for the benefit of the other Secured Creditors. The Collateral shall rank and secure the liabilities owed to the Credit Facility Lenders, the PIL Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties, the Noteholders and the Pari Passu Creditors pari passu and without any preference between them, except that pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, all proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral or from the Collateral following a Distress Event will be applied as provided below under "--Application o f proceeds". In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the guarantees and security will be released in certain circumstances described further below in "--Release o f security and guarantees--non-distressed disposals" and "--Release o f security and guarantees--distressed disposals".

Permitted payments
Prior to an acceleration event, the Intercreditor Agreement will permit payments to be made by the Debtors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (or any other documentation setting out the terms of the Credit Facility Liabilities, (together with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the "Credit Facilities Agreements"), the Pension Insurance Line Agreement, the Indenture and any Pari Passu Debt documentation (provided such payments are permitted under such documents (or any documents relating to refinancing indebtedness is complied with)) and does not limit or restrict any other payment by any Debtor other than in respect of the Subordinated Liabilities. The Intercreditor Agreement will also permit payments to lenders of Intra-Group Liabilities provided that there has been no acceleration event. No payments may be made in respect of Shareholder Liabilities except as permitted by the Credit Facility Agreements, the Pension Insurance Line Agreement, the Indenture and any Pari Passu Debt documentation. There are also restrictions on payments to Hedge Counterparties except certain specified permitted payments.
