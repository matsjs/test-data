Permitted payments
The Debtors may not make payments in respect of the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Pension Insurance Line Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities or any Pari Passu Debt after an acceleration event unless in accordance with the enforcement proceeds waterfall described below under "--Application o f proceeds" or otherwise agreed with the other Creditor.
