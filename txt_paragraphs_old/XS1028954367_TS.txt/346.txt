In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, and any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, transfer, issuance, or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Note Guarantee or any other document referred to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes after this offering) or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited, solely in the case of taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (5) or (7) above or any combination thereof), and any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee.

Guarantee, each of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer's Certificate must also set forth any other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Issuer and the relevant Guarantor will provide the Trustee with documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee evidencing the payment of Additional Amounts. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and will timely remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee (or to a holder upon written request), within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee or the holder) by such entity.
Whenever in the Indenture or in this " Description o f Notes" there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment under or with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.
