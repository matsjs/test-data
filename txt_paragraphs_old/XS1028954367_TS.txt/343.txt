Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Book-Entry Interests in Regulation S Global Notes will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under " Notice to investors" and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.
Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under " Plan o f distribution--Transfer restrictions".
Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, where appropriate, furnish certain

certificates and opinions and pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange; p ro v id e d that if the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party to the transfer or exchange, the holder will not be required to pay such Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive Registered Notes:
(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;
(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;
