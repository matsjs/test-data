 when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions relating to future indebtedness that may be incurred by the Debtors provided that it is permitted by the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Pension Insurance Line Agreement and the Indenture, which may rank pari passu to the Notes and be secured by the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the "Pari Passu Debt"). The creditors of the Pari Passu Debt (the "Pari Passu Creditors") will have certain rights under the Intercreditor Agreement which are summarized below.
The Intercreditor Agreement will also allow for a refinancing of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Pension Insurance Line, the Notes and any Pari Passu Debt. For the purposes of this description, any references to the Revolving Credit Facility, RCF Lenders, Credit Facility Liabilities (as defined below), Pension Insurance Line, PIL Lenders, Pension Insurance Line Liabilities (as defined below), Notes, Noteholders or Notes Liabilities (as defined below) should be read as including any such refinancing debt. With respect to any Pension Insurance Line, such refinancings may include increases in commitments and Additional Pension Insurance Lines being put into place up to the amount of our pension liability at the applicable time.
The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, that will be contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety, nor does it describe provisions relating to the rights and obligations of holders of other classes of our debt. As such, we urge you to read the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the discussion which follows, defines the rights of the Noteholders.
