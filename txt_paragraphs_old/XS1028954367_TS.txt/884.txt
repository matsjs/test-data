Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the CEO The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appro priations of the company's profit or loss, and the Board of Direc tors and the CEO are responsible for administration under the Companies Act. Auditor's responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion with reasonable assur ance on the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss and on the administration based on our audit. We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing stand ards in Sweden.
As a basis for our opinion concerning discharge from liabili ty, in addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidat ed accounts, we examined significant decisions, actions taken and circumstances of the company in order to determine wheth er any member of the Board of Directors or the CEO is liable to the company. We also examined whether any member of the Board of Directors or the CEO has, in any other way, acted in contraven tion of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Arti cles of Association.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Opinions We recommend to the annual meeting of shareholders that the profit be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the stat utory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the CEO be discharged from liability for the finan cial year
