The decrease in sales volume in 2013 was attributable to the period from January to August, reflecting the continuing uncertainty in the economic conditions. In addition, a fire at our manufacturing facility at Imatra in May 2013 resulted in a production stop for approximately six weeks, which also contributed to the decrease in our sale volume. In 2012, we also experienced a fire at Imatra, which resulted in a production stop for approximately five weeks. Our sales volume started to increase again in September 2013 resulting in higher sales volumes in September, October, November and December of 2013 compared to the corresponding periods in 2012, which partially offset lower sales volumes in the first eight months of 2013. We believe that the increase in demand from September 2013 was primarily driven by a combination of a more positive economic outlook and our initiatives to grow revenue. Our order intake in 2013 increased by approximately 10%, compared to 2012.
