- The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) is determined using generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis that take figures from observable market transactions and the quoted market prices of compa rable instruments.
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments mea sured at fair value. Measurements are classified in a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs based on the lowest level of input significant to overall fair value.
Level 1: Fair value is determined based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Fair value is determined based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).
Level 3: Fair value is determined based on inputs for the asset or liabil ity that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
