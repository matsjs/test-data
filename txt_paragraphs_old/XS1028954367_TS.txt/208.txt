Net sales. Net sales decreased by EUR183.5 million, or 16.4%, from EUR1,120.6 million in 2011 to EUR937.1 million in 2012. The decrease in net sales in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily attributable to a significant decrease in sales volume, which decreased by 157 kt, or 18%, from 851 kt in 2011 to 694 kt in 2012. The negative effect of the volume decrease was partially offset by a slight increase in base price.
