The group's normal annual consumption of electricity is approximately 1 TW h. To mitigate price volatility that causes fluctuations in cash flow and earnings, hedging measures are used by which portions of the vari able price of electricity are transferred to a fixed price. At year-end 2012, anticipated future electricity consumption was hedged according to the following contracts: 62 % for 2013,44 % for 2014 and 23 % for 2015. A rise of 10 % in the price o f electricity compared to the spot price at 31 December 2012 would have a positive impact on Ovako's compre hensive income, before tax, of approximately E U R 0.3 million, taking into account the hedging contracts that exist and with the same annual consumption as in 2012.

n o te 23. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CoNT.
liquidity and refinancing risk Liquidity and refinancing risk is the risk of the group having insuffi cient access to the funds necessary to meet its obligations.
The group's financing is achieved through the financing agreement signed in 2010, as further described in Note 21. As described in Note 21, there are loan covenants, which may pose a risk to the company's access to capital. Total credit utilised at 31 December amounted to EU R 267.1 (296.0) million. O f the revolving credit facility totalling EU R 75.0 million, E U R 3.8 million was utilised in the form of issued bank guarantees, which means the unutilised facility amounts to EU R 71.2 (75.0) million.
Surplus liquidity is used primarily to repay debt. I f this is impossible, the surplus funds are invested within internally defined limits with banks that are counterparties to the group's credit agreements.
The maturity structure of debt over future years is presented in Note 21. The table below shows contractual undiscounted payments including amortisation, interest and interest-rate derivatives linked to the financing agreement.
The calculation assumes that the IBO R interest rate is unchanged from the rate at 31 December 2012. Cash flows for derivatives are stated net.
