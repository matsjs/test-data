The mortality assumptions for the Swedish pension plan were changed in 2011, which is the main cause of actuarial losses in 2011. Otherwise, it is changes in the discount rate that affect the group's liability for pensions and other post-employment benefits. A change in the discount rate of 0.25% in calculating the present value of benefits according to the Swedish pension plan increased the pension liability by EU R 2 million in 2011.
