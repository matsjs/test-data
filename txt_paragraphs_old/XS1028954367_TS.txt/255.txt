The automotive sector (passenger cars and light trucks, commercial vehicles and buses) is the largest final end user market for low alloy engineering steel accounting for 35% to 45% of the total demand with vehicles, depending on size, consuming 100 to 300 kg of engineering steel. Other important markets include the forgings industry, off highway vehicles (mining, construction, agriculture, forestry), industrial equipment (cranes, lift trucks, stationary equipment), energy (drilling, utilities, wind turbines), industrial fasteners, aerospace, and tools including lawn and garden. The following table shows the total consumption of long engineering steel products in the EU and consumption in select end markets.
