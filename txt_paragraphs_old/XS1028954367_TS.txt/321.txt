On or prior to the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries will enter into a super senior revolving credit facility agreement expressed to be governed by English law with, Nordea Bank AB (publ) as mandated lead arranger, original lender and agent (the "RCF Agent"), providing for a committed EUR40.0 million multicurrency revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") (with an option for one or more uncommitted additional facilities of up to an aggregate amount of EUR10.0 million (the "Additional Facilities") exercisable by the Parent Company subject to certain requirements being met). Subject to certain exceptions, loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed at any time. The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by loans (in Euro, Dollars, Sterling and Swedish Krona or other currencies agreed to by the relevant lenders) or ancillary facilities. We expect to roll over into the Revolving Credit Facility from our Senior Credit Facilities an overdraft facility of approximately EUR10 million and approximately EUR2.5 million in bank guarantees. Utilisations under the Revolving Credit Facility (other than under any Additional Facilities) may be used for general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group but may not be used for (i) the payment of transaction costs related to the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of equity or certain acquisitions and disposals of assets, (ii) the purchase, redemption, repayment or prepayment of the Notes (and any refinancing of the Notes), any Pension Insurance Line, certain secured debt ranking pari passu with the Notes (any refinancing of such debt) or any other term debt, (iii) the payment of any dividend, redemption, repurchase, defeasement, retirement, repayment, premium or any other distribution in respect of share capital or (iv) refinancing any cash utilisations under any other facility available to a member of the Group. Utilizations under the Additional Facilities may be used for any purpose agreed to by the person(s) providing commitments thereunder.
The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the date falling four years and six months after the Issue Date (or such other date as may be agreed in the case of any Additional Facility which shall be no earlier than the original termination date of the Revolving Credit Facility).
Interest will be payable on utilizations under the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount equal to the European Interbank Offered Rate (in the case of utilizations drawn in Euros), the Stockholm Interbank Offered Rate (in the case of utilizations drawn in Swedish Kroner) or the London Interbank Offered Rate (in all other cases), plus a margin. The initial margin payable on loans utilized under the Revolving Credit Facility is 3.50% per annum and will be, after twelve months from the Issue Date, a percentage rate per annum determined in accordance with a net leverage ratio related margin grid (ratchet) with a range from 3.00% to 3.50% per annum. We are also required to pay a commitment fee in arrears on the last day of each successive three-month period during the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility, on the available but unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 40% of the applicable margin under the Revolving Credit Facility. We may also be required to pay fees related to the issuance of Additional Facilities, and certain fees to the RCF Agent and the Security Agent in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by the Parent Company, the Issuer, and the other Guarantors and will be secured by the same Collateral that secures the Notes and the Guarantees. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides that, at the Issue Date and thereafter by reference to the Group audited annual financial statements, the aggregate gross assets (excluding goodwill, intragroup items and investments in subsidiaries) and EBITDA (in each case, calculated on an unconsolidated basis) of the Guarantors must (subject to certain limitations) represent not less than 85% of the Restricted Group's consolidated gross assets (excluding goodwill) and consolidated EBITDA (the "Guarantor Threshold Test").
Subject to certain conditions, we may voluntarily prepay all or part of our utilizations or permanently cancel all or part of the available commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, by giving five or three, respectively, business days' prior written notice to the RCF Agent. Amounts prepaid or repaid may (subject to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) be reborrowed.
In addition to any voluntary prepayments, the Revolving Credit Facility requires the Revolving Credit Facility to be prepaid and, in certain circumstances, cancelled, in the following circumstances (the "Mandatory Prepayment Provisions"):
(1) repayment in full of utilizations funded by, and cancellation of the commitments of, any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such lender to perform any of its obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility or to fund, issue or maintain its participation in any utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility;
(2) repayment in full of the Revolving Credit Facility and cancellation of the commitments thereunder immediately following the occurrence of a "Change of Control'' (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and which includes a Notes Change of Control);
