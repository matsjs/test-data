For purposes of determining compliance with this " Incurrence o f Indebtedness and issuance o f preferred stock" covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (16) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant; provided, however, that Indebtedness incurred under clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt may not be reclassified, unless upon such reclassification it no longer has priority with respect to distributions of proceeds of any enforcement of Collateral.

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness incurred under a revolving credit facility; p ro vid ed , h o w ever, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated in non-Euro currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement with respect to Euro the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in Euro will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the Euro-equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the Euro-equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness incurred under a revolving credit facility, except that to the extent that:
(1) such Euro-equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in which case the Refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence; and
(2) the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the Euro-equivalent of such excess will be determined on the date such refinancing Indebtedness is being incurred.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.
The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:
(1) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS;
(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and
