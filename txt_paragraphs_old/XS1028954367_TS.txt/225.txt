Net cash flows from financing activities amounted to a net cash inflow of EUR1.0 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to a net cash outflow of EUR5.4 million in the first quarter of 2013. The cash inflow from financing activities in the first quarter of 2014 was primarily due to a EUR10.0 million drawdown in the first quarter of 2014 under our revolving credit facility provided in our Senior Facilities Agreement to finance working capital, which was offset by higher repayments of borrowings of EUR9.0 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to a cash outflow of EUR5.4 million in the first quarter of 2013.
Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by EUR2.9 million, or 6.0%, from EUR48.7 million in 2012 to EUR45.8 million in 2013, primarily due to a slight decrease in capital expenditure (which we define as purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets) from EUR48.2 million in 2012 to EUR44.9 million in 2013. A decrease in capital expenditure in 2013 was in line with our Investment plan. However, the planned decrease in capital expenditure was partially offset by higher replacement investments at Imatra as a result of the fire in August 2013, which led to an additional capital expenditure of EUR3.4 million in 2013, which was not provided for in our investment plan. While we also experienced a fire at Imatra in 2012, the replacements investments in relation to the fire in 2012 were lower and amounted to EUR1.8 million.
Net cash flows used in financing activities amounted to EUR28.9 million in 2012, compared to net cash flows from financing of EUR4.9 million in 2013. The cash outflow from financing activities in 2012 was due to our repayment of borrowings in the amount of EUR28.9 million. In 2012, in addition to the mandatory instalment payments we also decided to use our cash flow to prepay some of the principal amounts outstanding under our long-term borrowings in order to benefit from pro rata reductions of our instalment payments due to voluntary prepayments. The cash inflow from financing activities in 2013 was primarily due to a EUR20 million drawdown under our Revolving Credit Facility to finance working capital and lower repayments of borrowings, which in 2013 amounted to EUR15.1 million.
Comparison between the Years Ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Net cash flows from operating activities increased by EUR30.8 million, or 54.9%, from EUR56.1 million in 2011 to EUR86.9 million in 2012, despite a decrease in our operating profit by EUR69.9 million, or 77.8%, from EUR89.8 million in 2011 to EUR19.9 million in 2012. This increase was primarily driven by changes in our working capital, which resulted in a cash inflow in the amount of EUR53.8 million in 2012, compared to a cash outflow of EUR35.4 million in 2011. The significant cash inflow in 2012 as a result of changes in working capital was primarily due the significant decrease in sales volumes to 694 kt in 2012, compared to 851 kt in 2011, reflecting lower demand for our products as a result of the unfavorable economic environment, which led to decreases in trade receivables and inventories. In addition, in 2012, we were able to extend payment terms with suppliers, which was the key driver for the increase in trade payables in 2012. In 2011, there was a cash outflow as a result of working capital changes, which reflected increases in trade receivables, inventories and trade payables following an increase in our sales volume to 851 kt in 2011.

Net cash flows used in investing activities increased by EUR14.9 million, or 44.1%, from EUR33.8 million in 2011 to EUR48.7 million in 2012, primarily due to higher planned capital expenditure in 2012 than 2011 in connection with our investment plan.
Net cash used in financing activities increased by EUR15.0 million, or 107.9%, from EUR13.9 million in 2011 to EUR28.9 million in 2012, primarily due to our decision in 2012 to prepay some of the principal amounts outstanding under our long-term borrowings in order to benefit from pro rata reductions of our required amortization payments due to voluntary prepayments.
