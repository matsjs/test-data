In the event of certain developments affecting taxation or certain other circumstances in the law of any relevant tax jurisdiction that would impose withholding taxes or other deductions on the payment of the Notes, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at anytime, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See "Description of Notes--Redemption for changes in taxes".
Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect to the Notes or any Guarantees will be made without withholding or deduction for taxes in any relevant taxing jurisdiction unless required by law. If withholding or deduction for such jurisdiction is required to be made with respect to a payment to the holders of Notes or any Guarantees, we will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received by the holders of Notes or any Guarantees after the withholding is not less than the amount that they would have received in the absence of the withholding, subject to certain exceptions. See "Description o f Notes--Additional amounts".
