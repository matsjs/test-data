The gross proceeds from the issuance of the Notes will be EUR300.0 million. We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes will amount to approximately EUR292.3 million, after payment of the estimated commissions and other expenses related to the Offering of the Notes. The Issuer will use the proceeds from the Offering to (i) repay the amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities, (ii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the Refinancing and (iii) for general corporate purposes.
On or about the Issue Date, we will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will provide for a Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of EUR40.0 million. On the Issue Date, the Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be undrawn. We expect to roll over into the Revolving Credit Facility from our Senior Credit Facilities an overdraft facility for approximately EUR10 million and approximately EUR2.5 million in bank guarantees.
The table below sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Refinancing. Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including differences from the estimates of outstanding amounts of existing indebtedness to be repaid on the Issue Date, the estimated amount of cash of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries as of the Issue Date, as well as the differences between estimated and actual fees and expenses.
