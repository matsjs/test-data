If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in this Clause 15, the Trustee shall take every reasonable measure necessary to recover the amounts outstanding under the Bonds.
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with this Clause 15, the Issuer shall redeem all Bonds with an amount per Bond equal to 103.25 per cent. of the Nominal Amount, or if the Bonds are accelerated on or after the First Call Date, at the applicable Call Option Price.
DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS
If the Bonds have been declared due and payable in accordance with Clause 15 (Termination of the Bonds), all payments by the Issuer relating to the Bonds shall be distributed in the following order of priority, in accordance with the instructions of the Trustee:
(a) firstly, in or towards payment pro rata of (i) all unpaid fees, costs, expenses and indemnities payable by the Issuer to the Trustee, (ii) other costs, expenses and indemnities relating to the termination of the Bonds, the enforcement of the Transaction Security or the protection of the Holders' rights under the Finance Documents, (iii) any non-reimbursed costs incurred by the Trustee for external experts, and (iv) any non-reimbursed costs and expenses incurred by the Trustee in relation to a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure;
(b) secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of accrued but unpaid Interest under the Bonds (Interest due on an earlier Interest Payment Date to be paid before any Interest due on a later Interest Payment Date);
(c) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid principal under the Bonds; and
(d) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under the Finance Documents.
Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with items (a) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer. The application of proceeds in accordance with items (a) to (d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal.
