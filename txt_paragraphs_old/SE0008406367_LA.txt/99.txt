By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Holder appoints the Trustee to act as its agent and security agent in all matters relating to the Bonds and the Finance Documents, and authorises the Trustee to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent, unless such consent is specifically required by these Terms and Conditions) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Bonds held by such Holder, including the winding-up, dissolution, liquidation, company reorganisation (Sw. företagsrekonstruktion), or bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction) of the Issuer. By acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Holder confirms such appointment and authorisation for the Trustee to act on its behalf.
The Issuer shall promptly upon request provide the Trustee with any documents and other assistance (in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee), that the Trustee deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents.
The Trustee is entitled to fees for its work and to be indemnified for costs, losses and liabilities on the terms set out in the Finance Documents and the Trustee's obligations as agent and security agent under the Finance Documents are conditioned upon the due payment of such fees and indemnifications.
The Trustee may act as agent and/or security agent for several issues of securities issued by or relating to the Issuer and Group Companies notwithstanding potential conflicts of interest.
