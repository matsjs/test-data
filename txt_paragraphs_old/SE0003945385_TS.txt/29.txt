In respect of Bonds registered with authorised nominees in accordance with the Swedish Financial Instruments Accounts Act (SFS 1998:1479), the authorised nominee shall be deemed to be the Holder for the purpose of applying these Terms and Conditions (subject to the provisions about the voting right of the Holders in Clause 12).

16.3 The Agent, the CSD and the Issuing Agent shall not be liable for damage caused in any other event, unless the damage is caused by gross negligence or wilful misconduct. In no event shall the Agent, the CSD and the Issuing Agent be liable for indirect damage.
