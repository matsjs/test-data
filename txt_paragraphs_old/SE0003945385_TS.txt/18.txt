If a Holder has, through an Account Operator, designated a certain bank account for payments of principal and interest, the CSD will on the relevant payment dates transfer the relevant payment to the account so designated. In other cases, payments will be made by the CSD transferring the payment to the Holder at the address registered with the CSD on the Record Date. If a day on which an amount becomes due and payable in accordance with these Terms and Conditions is not a Banking Day, payment will be made as aforesaid on the following Banking Day.

If a person to whom payment has been made in accordance with the above was not entitled to receive such payment, the Company and the CSD shall nevertheless be deemed to have fulfilled their obligations, provided that the Company and/or the CSD did not have knowledge that such payment was made to a person not entitled to receive such amount and provided the Company and/or the CSD acted with normal care.
