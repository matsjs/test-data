22.1 Appointment of the Trustee
(a) By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Bondholder appoints:
(i) the Trustee to act as its trustee in all matters relating to the Bonds and the Finance Documents, and authorises the Trustee to act on its behalf (without first having to obtain its consent, unless such consent is specifically required by these Terms and Conditions) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to the Bonds held by such Bondholder including the winding-up, dissolution, liquidation, company reorganisation (Sw. foretagsrekonstruktion) or bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) (or its equivalent in any other jurisdiction) of the Issuer including any legal or arbitration proceeding relating to the perfection, preservation, protection or enforcement of the Transaction Security.
(b) By acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Bondholder confirms the appointment and authorisation for the Trustee and the Security Agent to act on its behalf, as set out in Clause 22.1(a).
(c) Each Bondholder shall immediately upon request provide the Trustee and the Security Agent with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable), that the Trustee deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents. Neither the

(d) The Issuer shall promptly upon request provide the Trustee and the Security Agent with any documents and other assistance (in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable), that the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable deems necessary for the purpose of exercising its rights and/or carrying out its duties under the Finance Documents.
