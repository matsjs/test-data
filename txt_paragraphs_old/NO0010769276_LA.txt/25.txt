(g) The Bonds constitute direct, general, secured, unconditional and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu with all direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer, except those obligations which are mandatorily preferred by law, and without any preference among them.

any document or other material relating to the Issuer or the Bonds in any
jurisdiction other than Sweden, where action for that purpose is required. Each
Bondholder must inform itself about, and observe, any applicable restrictions
