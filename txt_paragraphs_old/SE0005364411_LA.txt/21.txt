(b) By subscribing for Bonds, each initial Bondholder agrees that the Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Bondholder confirms such agreement.
(d) Each Bond shall have an initial nominal amount of SEK 1,000,000, (the "Nominal Amount"). All Initial Bonds are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 100 per cent, of the Nominal Amount.
(e) The minimum permissible investment upon issuance of Bonds is SEK 1, 000, 000;

(f) Provided that:
(i) no Event of Default is continuing or would result from such issue; and
(ii) the Incurrence Test is met:
the Issuer may, at one or several occasions, issue Subsequent Bonds. Subsequent Bonds shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the ISIN, the interest rate, the currency, the nominal amount and the final maturity applicable to the Initial Bonds shall apply to Subsequent Bonds. The price of the Subsequent Bonds may be set at a discount or at a premium compared to the Nominal Amount. The maximum total nominal amount of the Bonds (the Initial Bonds and all Subsequent Bonds) may not exceed SEK 700,000,000.
(g) The Bonds constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and secured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank at least pari passu with all direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer, except those obligations which are mandatorily preferred by law, and without any preference among them.
