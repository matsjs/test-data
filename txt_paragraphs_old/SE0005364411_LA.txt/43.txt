It is or becomes impossible or unlawful for the Issuer to fulfill or perform any of the provisions of the Finance Documents or if the obligations under the Finance Documents are not, or cease to be, legal, valid, binding and enforceable.
15.9 Continuation of the business
The Issuer or any other Material Group Company ceases to carry on its business (except if due to a merger or demerger as stipulated in paragraph 15.6(a) above).
15.10 Limitations
Notwithstanding any other provisions in these Terms and Conditions, acceleration of the Bonds on the grounds mentioned in Clause 15.2 (Other obligations) above or, regarding any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries, on the grounds mentioned in Clauses 15.4 to and including Clause 15.9, above may only occur if the nature of the particular circumstance is such that it would have a Material Adverse Effect and that the cause of termination is continuing at the time of the Agent's declaration of acceleration. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned under Clause 15.4 above.
15.11 Acceleration of the Bonds
(a) If an Event of Default has occurred, the Agent is entitled to, on behalf of the Bondholders (i) by notice to the Issuer, declare all, but not only some, of the Bonds due for payment together with any other amounts payable under the Finance Documents, immediately or at such later date as the Agent determines (but such date may not fall after the Final Redemption Date), and (ii) exercise any or all of its rights, remedies, powers and discretions under the Finance Documents.
(b) The Agent may not accelerate the Bonds in accordance with Clause 15.11 by reference to a specific Event of Default if it is no longer continuing or if it has been decided, on a Bondholders' Meeting or by way of a Written Procedure, to waive such Event of Default (temporarily or permanently).
