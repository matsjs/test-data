The Company acquired all shares in KGH Group in May 2012. Prior to the Acquisition, the Company did not carry out any activities and did not publish any financial reports. Therefore, the only financial report published by the Company is the unaudited financial report for KGH Customs for the period ended 30 September 2012. However, as the Acquisition did not result in any major changes to the group than the new parent company, the Company has chosen to include KGH Group AB's annual reports for the fiscal years 2010 - 2011 in the Prospectus to give the reader an illustration of the Groups financial history reference (see "Documents incorporated by reference"). To illustrate the effect of the Acquisition on the accounts, the Company has also chosen to include unaudited pro forma financial information (the "Proforma") in the Prospectus. The auditors have examined the Proforma in accordance with the auditor's report set out on page 26. Further, the unaudited financial report for KGH Customs for the period ended 30 September 2012 is included in the Prospectus (see "Documents incorporated by reference").
