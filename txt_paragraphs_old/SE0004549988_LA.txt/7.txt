Financial risks
The Company is, through its subsidiaries' activities, exposed to financial risks such as risks relating to currency risk, exchange rate fluctuations as well as liquidity and refinancing risk.
Currency risk
The Company's functional currency is SEK. Although the Group's primary operations and cash flows are typically denominated in SEK, the Group has operations and costs that are not denominated in SEK. These include Euro ("EUR"), Norwegian Krone ("NOK") and Danish Krone ("DKK"). The Group may undertake hedging activities against these potential fluctuations; however, there are no assurances that hedging strategies, if implemented, would be successful. Exchange rate fluctuations
Fluctuations in exchange rates can have an impact on the Group's financial results in the event that the EUR, NOK and/or DKK (or any other currency in which the Group's costs might be incurred in the future) appreciate significantly against the SEK. Significant strengthening of these currencies against the SEK could increase both capital and operating costs, although where sales prices are denominated in local currency, there may be a mitigating increase in revenue. Liquidity and refinancing risks
Liquidity and refinancing risks refer to that costs may increase and that opportunities may be limited when loans are refinanced, and that payment obligations may not be met due to insufficient liquidity or difficulties in obtaining financing.
