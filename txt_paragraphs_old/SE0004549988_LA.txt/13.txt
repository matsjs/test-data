immediately upon request by the Bond Trustee provide the Bond Trustee with any such documents, including a written power of attorney, which the Bond Trustee deems necessary for the purpose of carrying out its duties under the terms and conditions for the Bonds.
The Bonds are freely transferable and trading can occur from the Issue Date.
The Bonds have been issued on the Swedish market through a so called private placement. No Bonds have been issued, or will be issued, after 22 May 2012 and the bond loan was subscribed in full on the Issue Date.
To simplify the trade in the Bonds, the Company intends to apply for listing of the Bonds at the corporate bond list on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm in connection with the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority's approval of this Prospectus. Further, the terms and conditions for the Bonds include an undertaking to list the Bonds not later than one year after the Issue Date, see further Section 12 (Special undertakings) of the terms and conditions for the Bonds. The fact that an application regarding listing of the Bonds on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm has been submitted to Nasdaq OMX Stockholm does however not mean that the application will be approved. The procedure of first issuing all Bonds and then listing the Bonds at the corporate bond list on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm has been chosen for efficiency reasons.
The total expenses of the admission to trading are estimated to amount to SEK 196,000.
