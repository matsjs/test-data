(g) a decision is made that any Material Group Company shall be merged and/or demerged into a company which is not a Group Company, unless the Bond Trustee has given its consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) in writing prior to the merger and/or demerger (where consent is not to be understood as a waiver of the rights that applicable law at the time assigns the concerned creditors);
(h) any expropriation, attachment, sequestration, distress or execution or any analogous process in any jurisdiction affects any asset or assets of any Material Group Company having an aggregate value of an amount equal to SEK five million (5,000,000) and is not discharged within thirty (30) days;
(i) it is or becomes impossible or unlawful for the Company to fulfil or perform any of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions; or
(j) the Company or any other Material Group Company ceases to carry on its business (except if due to a merger or demerger as stipulated in (g) above).
14.2 If the Bonds are declared due and payable, the Company shall redeem the Bonds at a redemption amount equal to the Bonds' Nominal Amount plus the accrued interest, if any, pursuant to Section 9 (Interest) from, but excluding, the preceding Interest Payment Date (or, if such date has not occurred, the Issue Date), up to and including the payment date.
14.3 Termination for payment prematurely on the grounds mentioned in Sections 14.1 (b), (c) and (d) or, regarding any of the Company's Subsidiaries, on the grounds mentioned in Sections 14.1 (e), (f), (g), (h), (i) and (j) may however only occur if the nature of the particular circumstance is such that it would have a Material Adverse Effect and that the cause of termination is continuing at the time of the Bond Trustee's declaration. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned in Section 14.1 (e) (ii).
