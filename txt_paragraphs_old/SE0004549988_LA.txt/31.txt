The comparison between SGAAP and the Proforma (prepared in accordance with IFRS) is provided to demonstrate where significant differences exist between these accounting standards as applied to KGH Customs' accounts as well as the effect of the Acquisition.
Proforma assumptions etcetera
As previously stated, KGH Customs has never published an annual report. Therefore, the Proforma has been prepared in accordance with IFRS to reflect the principles which will be applied by the Company in the annual report for 2012.
The source of the financial information on which the Proforma is based is the unaudited financial information for KGH Customs for the period ended 30 September 2012. In order to keep comparability between the Proforma before the Acquisition on 24 May 2012 and the Proforma after this date, the Proforma builds on KGH Group consolidated statement and the actual outcome in KGH Customs is included in the Proforma adjustments.
When preparing the Proforma, the Company has used the following assumptions:
- The Proforma is based on financial reports for KGH Group according to unaudited management accounts,
- The Bonds issued on 22 May 2012 by KGH Customs are considered to have been issued on 1 January 2011 with unchanged conditions, except that the interest and borrowing costs charge the financial outcome for the period 1 January 2011 until 22 May 2015,
- The acquisition of KGH Group is considered to have been completed on 1 January 2011 with the same purchase sum as the acquisition on 24 May 2012. Allocation and amortisations of intangible assets charge the financial outcome from 1 January 2011.
- Proforma adjustments regarding differences in SGAAP and IFRS have been taken into consideration and no significant differences were identified.
