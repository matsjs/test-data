Financial Indebtedness
12.5
Negative pledge
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that none of the Subsidiaries, create or allow to subsist, retain, provide, prolong or renew any guarantee or security over any of its/their assets (present or future) to secure any Financial Indebtedness, provided however that the Group Companies have a right to retain, provide, prolong and renew any Permitted Security.
12.6
Disposals of assets
The Issuer shall not, and shall procure that no Material Group Company, sell or otherwise dispose of shares in any Material Group Company or of all or substantially all of its or any Material Group Company's assets or operations to any Person not being the Issuer or any of the wholly-owned Subsidiaries, unless the transaction is carried out at fair market value and on terms and conditions customary for such transaction and provided that it does not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Issuer shall notify the Agent of any such transaction and, upon request by the Agent, provide the Agent with any information relating to the transaction which the Agent deems necessary (acting reasonably). For the avoidance of doubt, shares which have been pledged under the Share Pledge Agreements may not be disposed of as long as such shares remain pledged.
