14.1.4
In addition to the fee due to the Bond Trustee pursuant to Clause 14.1.2 and normal expenses pursuant to Clauses 14.1.1 and 14.1.3, the Issuer shall, on demand, cover extraordinary expenses incurred by the Bond Trustee in connection with the Bonds, as determined in a separate agreement between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee.
14.1.5 The Issuer is responsible for withholding any withholding tax imposed by applicable law on any payments to the Bondholders.
14.1.6
Any payable withholding tax that might be due shall be paid and arranged in full by the Issuer without deduction on payments unless the Issuer is required by law to make such a payment subject to the deduction or withholding of such taxes, in which case the sum payable by the Issuer (in respect of which such deduction or withholding is required to be made) shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that the Arranger, the Trustee or the Bondholders receive a sum net of any deduction or withholding equal to the sum which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made or required to be made.
