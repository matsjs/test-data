There is a minimum tender condition of 90% of the 2016 Notes and 75% of the 2017 Notes in the Exchange Offers.

completed, or as to the aggregate principal amount of each series of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes that will be exchanged for Exchange Notes.
We believe that the successful completion of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations will protect value for all of our stakeholders and position us to take advantage of a cyclical improvement in the publication paper industry cycle. The completion will also provide protection of the position of holders of the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes. Even after the completion of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, however, we will still have significant cash interest expense, high financial leverage and significant debt repayment obligations due in 2019.
Even if we successfully consummate the Exchange Offers or an alternative liability management transaction, our remaining indebtedness may impair ourfinancial condition and our ability to grow and compete, and we may incur additional debt.
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2015, without giving pro forma effect to the Transactions (but giving effect to the repayment of the 2015 Notes on October 15, 2015), we had total interest-bearing liabilities of NOK 9,148 million. Our high leverage has important consequences for our financial condition, including:
· requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, the execution of our business strategy, acquisitions, operations and general corporate requirements;
· making it more difficult to refinance our obligations as they come due;
· increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, competitive and industry conditions;
