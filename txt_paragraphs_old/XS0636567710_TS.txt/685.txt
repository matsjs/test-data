The conciliation agreem ent can also be approved by the court u p o n the d e b to r's request. The approval by the Court, w hich is subject to the satisfaction o f certain conditions, will make the existence o f the conciliation proceedings public (not the content o f the agreem ent except the guarantees, security interests and liens as well as the am ount o f claims benefiting from the so-called "N ew M oney Lien" detailed below, as provided for in the agreem ent-- save for the inform ation o f the em ployees' representatives if any) will have the following specific consequences:

· in the event o f subsequent safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings or judicial reorganization, the paym ent date o f claims benefiting from the New M oney Lien may not be rescheduled without their holders' consent;
