Address capital structure and achieve stability
We intend to address a portion of our immediate and medium-term debt maturities through the implementation of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations. We will strive to reduce leverage in the medium-term as part of our efforts to achieve a long-term sustainable capital structure. By reducing the amount of operational earnings committed to debt repayment obligations, we hope to achieve greater operational stability that will provide a basis for future sustained profitability.
Carefully evaluatefuture consolidation opportunities
We believe our industry needs to continue to better align capacity with demand, which we anticipate will be realized by industry consolidation in Europe. We will continue to evaluate selective opportunities to enhance our strategic and cost positions. However, any potential transaction will be structured with a focus on credit enhancement via careful evaluation of appropriate financing sources and terms.
