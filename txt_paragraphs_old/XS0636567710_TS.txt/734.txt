A proxy so appointed shall so long as such appointm ent remains in force be deemed, for all purposes in connection with the M eeting, to be the holder o f the Existing Notes, to which such appointment relates and the H older shall be deem ed for such purposes not to be the holder.
A Beneficial O w ner who does not w ish to attend the M eeting can request, or direct its Euroclear/Clearstream Direct Participant to request, through the Clearing Systems for the Holder to appoint proxies (being two em ployees o f the Exchange and Tabulation Agent) who will act as proxies to cast the votes relating to the Existing Notes in which he has an interest in a particular way at the Meeting.
Alternatively, Beneficial Owners who wish to attend and vote or who wish a different person to be appointed as their proxy to attend and vote at the M eeting should contact the relevant Clearing System to make arrangem ents for such person to be appointed as a proxy (by the Holder) in respect o f the Existing Notes in w hich they have an interest for the purposes o f attending and voting at the Meeting.
In either case, Beneficial Owners or their Euroclear/Clearstream Direct Participants must have made arrangements to vote w ith the relevant Clearing System by not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the M eeting and w ithin the relevant time lim it specified by the relevant Clearing System (who may set a significantly earlier deadline) and request or make arrangem ents for the relevant Clearing System to block the Existing Notes in the relevant E uroclear/C learstream D irect P articipant's account and to hold the sam e to the o rder o r u nder the control o f a P aying Agent.
A Euroclear/Clearstream Direct Participant whose Existing Notes have been blocked will thus be able to procure that either (i) an electronic voting instruction (an "E lectro n ic V oting In stru c tio n ") is given in accordance w ith the procedures o f the relevant Clearing System to instruct the relevant Clearing System that the vote(s) attributable to the Existing Notes the subject of such Electronic Voting Instruction should be cast in a particular way (either in favor or against) in relation to the Extraordinary Resolution in respect o f such Existing Notes, w hich instructions shall require the H older to appoint proxies as described above or (ii) it, or a person nom inated by it, be appointed as a proxy in respect o f such Existing Notes to attend and vote at the Meeting.
Any Security/Existing Notes so held and blocked for either o f these purposes will not be released to the Euroclear/Clearstream Direct Participant by the relevant Clearing System until the earlier o f (a) if the Euroclear/Clearstream Direct Participant is not entitled to an Early Instruction Fee the conclusion o f the M eeting (or adjourned M eeting if the M eeting is adjourned), (b) if the Euroclear/Clearstream D irect Participant is entitled to an Early Instruction Fee the earlier o f (i) the paym ent o f the Early Instruction Fee or (ii) the day w hich is 5 (five) Business Days after the Approval Date, as the case may be, and (c) upon such Security/Existing Notes ceasing in accordance with the procedures o f the relevant Clearing System and w ith the agreem ent o f the Paying Agent to be held to its order or under its control; provided, however, in the case o f (c) above, that if the Beneficial O w ner or Euroclear/Clearstream Direct Participant has caused a proxy to be appointed in respect o f such Security/Existing Notes, such Security/Existing Notes will not be released to the relevant Euroclear/Clearstream D irect Participant unless and until the Issuer and the relevant Paying Agent has received notice of the necessary revocation o f or amendment to such proxy.
Any Electronic Voting Instructions given or forms o f proxy submitted may not be revoked during the period starting 48 hours before the tim e fixed for the M eeting and ending at the conclusion o f such Meeting.
The holder of a form o f proxy attending the M eeting in person must bring w ith him evidence of his identity (for example, a passport).
