The 2017 Notes Proposal, if passed, will also amend the 2017 Notes (including the Permanent Global Note and 2017 Notes Agency Agreement) to add an optional redemption and mandatory exchange option to provide that the 2017 Notes shall be, at the option of the Parent, redeemable at a redemption price in an amount equal to, the 2017 Notes Redemption/Exchange Consideration or mandatorily exchangeable for the 2017 Notes Redemption/Exchange Consideration and to delete the requirement that that 2017 Notes be redeemed upon a change of control at the option of noteholders.
