 Skogn (Norway): our Skogn mill is the largest producer of newsprint in Norway with an annual production capacity of 570,000 tons. The mill serves customers worldwide, has its own port facilities and operates a route twice- a-week to the UK and Continental Europe.
 Albury (Australia): our Albury mill has an annual production capacity of 275,000 tons, which is approximately 76% of the newsprint grades used in Australia each year. The Albury mill is located in New South Wales, between Sydney and Melbourne.
 Boyer (Australia): our Boyer mill has an annual production capacity of 150,000 tons of newsprint and 140,000 tons of LWC, which was partially converted in 2014 to produce coated mechanical paper.
 Tasman (New Zealand): our Tasman mill supplies all of New Zealand's newsprint and telephone directory requirements, with export production throughout Asia and the South Pacific. The mill has an annual production capacity of 155,000 tons of newsprint.

Publication Paper Industry Trends
Europe
We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from any price increases in the European publication paper sector. According to RISI forecasts, publication paper prices across all grades are expected to increase in 2016. Compared to price levels during the third quarter of 2015, Western European SC prices are expected to increase by 5.2%, LWC prices are expected to increase by 5.1% and newsprint prices are expected to increase by 8.2%. We believe these forecasts imply that the publication paper sector is showing signs of improvement from current pricing levels. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of print for publishers' revenue generation, publishers' investment in print sites, a stabilization of the decline of global publication paper demand and anticipated reductions in overcapacity will be factors that will influence positive pricing trends during the next few years.
According to PPPC, Western European newsprint demand declined by 8.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the prior year period, and 6.3% in 2014 and 5.8% in 2013. Uncoated mechanical paper demand declined by 1.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the prior year period, and 5.2% in 2014 and 1.6% in 2013. Coated mechanical paper demand declined by 4.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the prior year period, and 3.2% in 2014 and 7.8% in 2013. On the supply side, there have been significant capacity closures in recent years, with additional closures set to occur going forward across all grades. Burgo announced its plan to close its 150,000 tons LWC paper machine at its Duino mill in Italy in December 2015. SCA is expected to close its 135,000 tons newsprint machine at its Ortviken mill. Heinzel Group announced its plan to convert its 260,000 tons SC machine from publication paper to packaging. The operating rate for newsprint improved to 92% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to 90% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The operating rate for uncoated mechanical paper in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 improved to 86% compared to 85% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The operating rate for coated mechanical paper has been stable at 87% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2014. We believe these industry dynamics are factors that could contribute to higher utilization rates and a potential improvement in the pricing environment in Europe.
