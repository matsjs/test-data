E ach o f the P a re n t's O rdinary Shares carries one vote. In general, decisions that shareholders are entitled to m ake under N orw egian law o r the P a re n t's A rticles o f A ssociation m ay b e m ade by a sim ple m ajority o f the votes cast. In the case o f elections or appointments, the person(s) who receive(s) the greatest number o f votes cast are elected. However, as required under N orw egian law, certain decisions, including resolutions to waive preferential rights to subscribe in connection w ith any share issue in the Parent, to approve a merger or dem erger o f the Parent, to am end the Articles o f Association, to authorise an increase or reduction in the share capital, to authorise an issuance o f convertible loans or warrants by the Parent or to authorise the Board o f Directors to purchase Ordinary Shares and hold them as treasury shares or to dissolve the Parent, must receive the approval o f at least two-thirds o f the aggregate num ber o f votes cast as well as at least two-thirds o f the share capital represented at a general meeting. Norwegian law further requires that certain decisions, which have the effect of substantially altering the rights and preferences of any shares or class of shares, receive the approval by the holders o f such shares or class o f shares as well as the majority required for amending the Articles o f Association.
In general, only a shareholder registered in the VPS is entitled to vote for such Ordinary Shares. Beneficial owners o f the Ordinary Shares that are registered in the name o f a nominee are generally not entitled to vote under N orw egian law, nor is any person who is designated in the VPS register as the holder o f such Ordinary Shares as nominees. A shareholder must, in order to be eligible to register, meet and vote for such Shares at the general meeting, transfer the O rdinary Shares fro m such nom inee account to an account in the shareholder's nam e in the V PS. P arent has included a "registration date" in its Articles o f Association, and accordingly such registration m ust take place at the latest five business days prior to the date o f the general meeting.

Additional issuances and preferential rights
I f the P arent issues any new O rdinary Shares, including bonus share issues, the P a re n t's A rticles o f A ssociation must be am ended, which requires the same vote as other am endments to the Articles o f Association. In addition, under N orw egian law, the P a re n t's shareholders have a preferential right to subscribe fo r new O rdinary Shares issued by th e Parent. Preferential rights may be derogated from by resolution in a general meeting passed by the same vote required to amend the Articles o f Association. A derogation o f the shareholders' preferential rights in respect o f bonus issues requires the approval o f all outstanding Ordinary Shares.
The general meeting may, by the same vote as is required for amending the Articles o f Association, authorise the Board o f Directors to issue new Ordinary Shares, and to derogate from the preferential rights o f shareholders in connection w ith such issuances. Such authorisation may be effective for a maximum o f two years, and the nominal value o f the Ordinary Shares to be issued may not exceed 50% o f the registered nom inal share capital w hen the authorisation is registered w ith the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises.
U nder Norwegian law, the Parent may increase its share capital by a bonus share issue, subject to approval by the P aren t's shareholders, by transfer fro m the P a re n t's distributable equity and thus th e share capital increase does not require any paym ent o f a subscription price by the shareholders. Any bonus issues may be affected either by issuing new shares to the P a re n t's existing shareholders o r b y increasing the nom inal value o f the P aren t's o u tstanding O rdinary Shares.
Issuance o f new Ordinary Shares to shareholders who are citizens or residents o f the U nited States upon the exercise o f preferential rights may require the Parent to file a registration statement in the United States under United States securities laws. Should the P arent in such a situation decide not to file a registration statem ent, the P aren t's U.S. shareholders may not be able to exercise their preferential rights. If a U.S. shareholder is ineligible to participate in a rights offering, such shareholder would not receive the rights at all and the Parent would seek to sell such rights on the shareholder's behalf.
