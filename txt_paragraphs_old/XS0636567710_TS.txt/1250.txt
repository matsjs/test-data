On 22 January 2015, Norske Skog launched two separate offers (i) an offering of EUR 290 million (EUR 179 million) Senior Secured Notes (SSN) due December 2019 and (ii) an exchange offer of existing notes.
On 24 February 2015, Norske Skog completed the refinancing of a portion of its bond maturities through the issuance of EUR 290 million senior secured notes (SSN) and the exchange of existing bonds into new bonds with longer maturities. Norske Skog extended the maturities on a significant portion of its indebtedness, with new notes maturing in 2019, 2021 and 2023. The new EUR 290 million SSN mature in December 2019 and is structurally senior to all remaining existing notes and notes issued in the exchange offer. The exchange notes are structurally junior to the SSN, but structurally senior to remaining existing notes and mature in 2021 and 2023. The remaining existing are structurally junior to the SSN and exchange notes.
More than 75% of the existing bond holders consented to the transactions, and approximately 45% of the existing bonds
participated in the exchange offer. Norske Skog recognised a net gain in connection with the refinancing of NOK 869 million in first quarter 2015, included in Other financial items in the table above.
In January, prior to the offering of the SSN and the exchange offer, several changes in the Norske Skog corporate structure were made. Norske Skog AS w as established a s the issuer of the SSN, while Norske Skog Holding AS w as established a s the offeror of the exchange notes.
The continued depreciation of the NOK in third quarter has impacted on the translation of debt into NOK at 30 September, resulting in unrealized currency loss. However, a weak NOK is favorable for the underlying business and the competitiveness of the Norwegian mills. The NOK has since quarter end appreciated.
