Investments in subsidiaries are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Shares in subsidiaries are written down to their recoverable amount when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of the investment. For impairment testing purposes, investments in subsidiaries are grouped in the same manner as the cash-generating units for the group. The carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries within each cash-generating unit is measured against the recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries within this cash generating unit.
See Note 23 in the consolidated financial statements for a specification of shares in subsidiaries and other shares.
