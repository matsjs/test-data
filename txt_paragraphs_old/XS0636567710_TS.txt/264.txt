Other Activities. Activities in our Group that do not fall into either Publication Paper Europe or Publication Paper Australasia are presented under Other Activities. This includes mainly corporate functions and some minor real estate activities.
Eliminations. Eliminations represent intra-group eliminations. Since January 1, 2014, eliminations generally relate to intra-group services, primarily corporate headquarters operations. Historically, in addition to intra- group services, eliminations included sales of energy to internal parties and other activities. Eliminations items reduce both operating revenue and cost of materials.
As described under "--Factors Affecting Comparability--Changes in reporting segments'", we have changed our operating segments with effect from January 1, 2014.
