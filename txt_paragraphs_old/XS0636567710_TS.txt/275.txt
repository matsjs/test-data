Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity risk management
We are exposed to liquidity risk in a scenario where our cash flow from operating activities is not sufficient to cover payments of financial liabilities. In order to effectively mitigate liquidity risk, our risk management strategy focuses on maintaining sufficient cash and securing available financing through committed credit facilities. Managing liquidity risk is centralized on a Group level.
In order to manage future liquidity risk, we forecast both short-term and long-term cash flows. Cash flow forecasts include cash flows stemming from operations, investments, asset sales, financing activities and financial instruments.

Liquidity
As of September 30, 2015, without giving pro forma effect to the Transactions (but giving effect to the repayment of the 2015 Notes on October 15, 2015), we had total interest bearing liabilities of NOK 8,946 million, including 108 million (NOK 1,033 million) of 2016 Notes and 212 million (NOK 2,024 million) of 2017 Notes. Our liquidity position as of September 30, 2015, was approximately NOK 1,000 million, including cash and cash equivalents of NOK 699 million and unused headroom under committed financing frames in existing securitization/factoring program capacity. As of December 31, 2015, our cash balances included restricted cash of approximately NOK 250 million. A liquidity buffer of around NOK 200 million is prudent to allow for daily volatility in working capital.
