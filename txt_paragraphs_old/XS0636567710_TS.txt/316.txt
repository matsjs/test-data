A decision by the Parent to merge w ith another company or to demerge requires a resolution by the general meeting of the shareholders passed by at least two-thirds of the aggregate votes cast and at least two-thirds of the share capital represented at the general meeting. A merger plan, or demerger plan signed by the Board of Directors along with certain other required docum entation, w ould have to b e sent to all the P a re n t's shareholders, or if the A rticles o f A ssociation stipulate that, m ade available to the shareholders o n the co m p an y 's w ebsite, at least one m onth p rio r to the general meeting to pass upon the matter.
Liability of board members
M em bers of the B oard of Directors owe a fiduciary duty to the Parent and its shareholders. Such fiduciary duty requires that the Board M embers act in the best interests of the Parent when exercising their functions and exercise a general duty of loyalty and care towards the Parent. Their principal task is to safeguard the interests of the Parent.
M embers of the Board of Directors may each be held liable for any damage they negligently or wilfully cause the Parent. N orw egian law permits the general meeting to discharge any such person from liability, but such discharge is not binding on the Parent if substantially correct and complete information was not provided at the general meeting of the P aren t's shareholders passing upon the m atter. I f a resolution to discharge the P a re n t's b o ard m em bers fro m liability or not to pursue claims against such a person has been passed by a general meeting w ith a smaller majority than that required to amend the Articles o f Association, shareholders representing more than 10% o f the share capital or, if there are m ore th an 100 shareholders, m ore than 10% o f the shareholders m ay pursue the claim o n the P aren t's b e h a lf and in its nam e. The cost o f any such action is not the P a re n t's responsibility b u t can b e reco v ered fro m any proceeds the P arent receives as a result o f the action. I f the decision to discharge any o f the P aren t's b o ard m em bers fro m liability o r n ot to pursue claim s against the P aren t's b oard m em bers is m ade by such a m ajority as is necessary to am en d the A rticles o f A ssociation, the m inority shareholders o f the P aren t cannot pursue such claim in the P aren t's name.
Indemnification of board members
N either Norwegian law nor the Articles o f Association contains any provision concerning indemnification by the Parent o f the B oard o f Directors. The Parent is perm itted to purchase insurance for the board m embers against certain liabilities that they may incur in their capacity as such.
Distribution of assets on liquidation
U nder N orw egian law, the P arent m ay be w ound-up b y a resolution o f the P a re n t's shareholders at the general meeting passed by at least two-thirds of the aggregate votes cast and at least two-thirds of the share capital represented at the meeting. In the event o f liquidation, the Ordinary Shares rank equally in the event o f a return on capital.
