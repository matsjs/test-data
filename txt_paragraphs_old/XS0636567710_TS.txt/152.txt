See "Terms and Conditions o f the Perpetual Notes--Taxation". The Parent may redeem the Perpetual Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, upon giving prior notice, if certain changes in tax law impose certain withholding taxes on amounts payable on the Notes, and, as a result, the Parent is required to pay additional amounts with respect to such withholding taxes.
