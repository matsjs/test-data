The fair value of commodity contracts recognised in the balance sheet is calculated by using quotes from actively traded markets when available. Otherwise, price forecasts from acknowledged external sources are used. Commodity contracts that fail to meet the own-use exemption criteria in IAS 39 are recognised in the balance sheet and valued on the same principle as financial con tracts. Some of these are long-term energy contracts. In calculating the fair value of embedded derivatives, valuation techniques are used in the absence of observable market inputs. Embedded currency options are calculated using a Black 76 valuation model, where some input assumptions have been made in absence of an active long-term option market. Fair value includes the impact of credit risk and the adjustment for credit risk is dependent on whether the derivative is in the money (asset) or out of the money (liability).

is applied to assets positions based on credit risk associated with the counter-party. Debit value adjustment is (from 2014) applied to liability positions, based on Norske Skog's own credit risk. The following table is presented in accordance with IFRS 13.94, showing the fair value of commodity contracts in level 3 given a change in assumptions to a reasonably possible alternative.
