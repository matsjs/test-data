U nder Norwegian law, the Parent may increase its share capital by a bonus share issue, subject to approval by the P aren t's shareholders, by transfer fro m the P a re n t's distributable equity and thus th e share capital increase does not require any paym ent o f a subscription price by the shareholders. Any bonus issues may be affected either by issuing new shares to the P a re n t's existing shareholders o r b y increasing the nom inal value o f the P aren t's o u tstanding O rdinary Shares.
Minority rights
N orw egian law sets forth a num ber o f protections for minority shareholders o f the Parent, including but not lim ited to those described in this paragraph and the description o f general m eetings as set out above. A ny o f the P aren t's shareholders m ay petition N orw egian courts to have a d ecisio n o f the B oard o f D irectors o r the P a re n t's shareholders made at the general meeting declared invalid on the grounds that it unreasonably favours certain shareholders or third parties to the detrim ent o f o ther shareholders o r the P arent itself. The P aren t's shareholders m ay also p etition the courts to dissolve the Parent as a result o f such decisions to the extent particularly strong reasons are considered by the court to make necessary dissolution o f the Parent.
M inority shareholders holding 5% o r m ore o f the P a re n t's share capital have a right to dem and in w riting that the P aren t's B oard o f D irectors convene a n extraordinary general m eeting to discuss o r resolve specific m atters. In addition, any o f the P a re n t's shareholders m ay in w riting dem and that the P arent place a n item o n the agenda fo r any general m eeting as long as the P a re n t's B oard o f D irectors is notified w ith in seven days before the deadline fo r convening the general meeting and the demand is accompanied with a proposed resolution or a reason for why the item shall be on the agenda. If the notice has been issued w hen such a w ritten dem and is presented, a renewed notice must be issued if the deadline for issuing notice o f the general meeting has not expired.
Rights of redemption and repurchase of Ordinary Shares
The share capital of the Parent may be reduced by reducing the nominal value of the Ordinary Shares or by cancelling Ordinary Shares. Such a decision requires the approval o f at least two-thirds of the aggregate num ber of votes cast and at least two-thirds o f the share capital represented at a general meeting. Redem ption o f individual Ordinary Shares requires the consent o f the holders of the Ordinary Shares to be redeemed.
The Parent may purchase its own Ordinary Shares provided that the Board o f Directors has been granted an authorisation to do so by a general meeting w ith the approval o f at least two-thirds o f the aggregate num ber o f votes cast and at least tw o-thirds o f the share capital represented at the meeting. The aggregate nom inal value o f treasury shares so acquired, and held by the P arent m ust not exceed 10% o f the P a re n t's share capital, and treasury shares m ay only b e acquired if the P a re n t's distributable equity, according to the latest adopted balance sheet, exceeds the consideration to be p aid fo r the shares. The authorisation by the general m eeting o f the P a re n t's shareholders cannot b e granted fo r a period exceeding 18 m onths.
