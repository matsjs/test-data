Eligible Holders will need to allow sufficient time to ensure timely delivery of the necessary documents. None of the Parent, the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer, the Exchange and Tabulation Agent or the Existing Notes Trustees or any other person or entity is under any duty to give notification of defects or irregularities with respect to tenders of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes for exchange or deliveries of consents.

Beneficial owners will need to be aware that their broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee may establish its own earlier deadline for participation in the Exchange Offers. Accordingly, beneficial owners wishing to participate in the Exchange Offers should contact their broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee as soon as possible in order to determine the time by which such owner must take action in order to participate.
The Exchange Ratios for the Exchange Offers and the terms o f the Exchange Notes do not reflect any independent valuation of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes or the Exchange Notes.

The Exchange Notes may trade at a discount to their principal amount or the trading value, redemption price or principal amount o f the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes.
Each series of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes is currently trading at a discount to the principal amount of such series. While the market, if any, for the Exchange Notes will depend on many factors, including prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, general economic conditions and our financial condition, performance and prospects, the Exchange Notes may trade at a discount to their principal amount and any such discount may be significant. There can be no assurance that the Exchange Notes will trade at or above the principal amount of such Exchange Notes in the future, or at or above the current or future trading prices of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes.
Upon consummation o f the Exchange Offers, there may be a limited or no trading marketfor the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes and marketpricesfor outstanding Relevant 2016/2017 Notes may decline as a result.
There are currently limited trading markets for the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes. To the extent the Exchange Offers are consummated, the aggregate principal amounts of outstanding Relevant 2016/2017 Notes may be significantly reduced. The trading markets for any Relevant 2016/2017 Notes not tendered in the Exchange Offers that remain outstanding could become even more limited or nonexistent due to the reduction in the amount of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes outstanding after consummation of the Exchange Offers (and the effects of any amendments to the terms of the 2017 Notes). If the amendments contemplated by the Consent Solicitations become operative, among other things, the outstanding principal amount of any 2017 Notes not tendered in the Exchange Offers may be amended to be reduced by 90.0%. If trading markets for non-tendered Relevant 2016/2017 Notes exist after the consummation of the Exchange Offers, such Relevant 2016/2017 Notes may trade at a discount to the price at which they would have traded if the Exchange Offers had not been consummated depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors. The reduction in the amount of a series of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes outstanding after consummation of the Exchange Offers may also tend to make the trading prices more volatile. There can be no assurance that active markets in the non-tendered Relevant 2016/2017 Notes will exist or be maintained and there can be no assurance as to the prices at which the non-tendered Relevant 2016/2017 Notes may be traded. We do not intend to create or sustain a market for any Relevant 2016/2017 Notes that remain outstanding following the consummation of the Exchange Offers.
We cannot assure Holders that existing rating agency ratingsfor the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes will be maintained.
