French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside insolvency proceedings, the "action paulienne" provisions, which offer creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act perform ed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreem ent pursuant to which such person guarantees the performance o f the obligations o f a third-party or agrees to provide or provides security for any o f such p erso n 's o r a third-party's obligations, enters into additional agreem ents ben efitin g fro m existing security and any o th er legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings o f the relevant person by, as the case m ay be, the creditors' representative (m andataire judiciaire), the com m issioner o f the safeguard o r recovery p lan (com m issaire a l 'execution du p la n ) o f the relevant p erso n o r by any o f the creditors o f the relevant perso n w ho w as prejudiced in its means o f recovery as a consequence o f the act in or outside insolvency proceedings, and may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the person perform ed such acts w ithout an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case o f the p e rso n 's insolvency proceedings, any creditor, w as prejudiced in its m eans o f recovery as a consequence o f the act; and (iii) at the time the act was perform ed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew o r should have k n o w n that one o r m ore o f such p e rso n 's creditors (existing o r future) w ould be prejudiced in their means o f recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (a titre gratuit), in w hich case such knowledge o f the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds o f fraudulent conveyance. If a court found that the granting o f the security interests in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the granting o f such security interests in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result o f such successful challenges, holders o f the Notes may not enjoy the benefit o f the security interests in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral and the value o f any consideration that holders o f the Notes received with respect to the security interests in the QSF Exchange Notes Collateral could also be subject to recovery from the holders o f the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders o f the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the French grantor as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.
