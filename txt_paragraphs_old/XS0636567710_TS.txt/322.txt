acquirer is obliged to restate its offer at such higher price. A mandatory offer m ust be in cash or contain a cash alternative at least equivalent to any other consideration offered.
Any person, entity or consolidated group that owns shares representing more than one-third o f the votes in a company listed on a Norwegian regulated m arket (with the exception o f certain foreign companies) is obliged to make an offer to purchase the remaining shares o f the company (repeated offer obligation) if the person, entity or consolidated group through acquisition becomes the owner o f shares representing 40%, or more of the votes in the company. The same applies correspondingly if the person, entity or consolidated group through acquisition becomes the owner o f shares representing 50% or more o f the votes in the company. The mandatory offer obligation ceases to apply if the person, entity or consolidated group sells the portion of the shares w hich exceeds the relevant threshold w ithin four weeks o f the date on w hich the m andatory offer obligation was triggered.
Any person, entity or consolidated group that has passed any o f the above mentioned thresholds in such a way as not to trigger the mandatory bid obligation, and has therefore not previously made an offer for the remaining shares in the company in accordance w ith the mandatory offer rules is, as a m ain rule, obliged to make a m andatory offer in the event of a subsequent acquisition o f shares in the company.
Compulsory acquisition
Pursuant to the N orw egian Public Lim ited Companies Act and the N orw egian Securities Trading Act, a shareholder who, directly or through subsidiaries, acquires shares representing 90% or more o f the total number of issued shares in a Norwegian public lim ited liability company, as well as 90% or more o f the total voting rights, has a right, and each remaining minority shareholder o f the company has a right to require such majority shareholder, to effect a compulsory acquisition for cash of the shares not already owned by such majority shareholder. Through such compulsory acquisition the m ajority shareholder becom es the ow ner of the rem aining shares w ith im m ediate effect.
If a shareholder acquires shares representing more than 90% o f the total num ber o f issued shares, as well as more than 90% o f the total voting rights, through a voluntary offer in accordance w ith the Securities Trading Act, a compulsory acquisition can, subject to the following conditions, be carried out w ithout such shareholder being obliged to make a m andatory offer: (i) the compulsory acquisition is com m enced no later than four weeks after the acquisition of shares through the voluntary offer; (ii) the price offered per share is equal to or higher than what the offer price w ould have been in a mandatory offer; and (iii) the settlement is guaranteed by a financial institution authorised to provide such guarantees in Norway.
A majority shareholder who effects a com pulsory acquisition is required to offer the minority shareholders a specific price per share, the determ ination o f w hich is at the discretion o f the majority shareholder. However, where the offeror, after making a mandatory or voluntary offer, has acquired more than 90% of the voting shares o f a company and a corresponding proportion o f the votes that can be cast at the general meeting, and the offeror pursuant to Section 4-25 of the N orwegian Public Limited Companies Act completes a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares within three months after the expiry o f the offer period, it follows from the N orw egian Securities Trading Act that the redem ption price shall be determined on the basis o f the offer price for the mandatory/voluntary offer unless specific reasons indicate another price.
Should any minority shareholder not accept the offered price, such minority shareholder may, within a specified deadline o f not less than two months, request that the price be set by a N orw egian court. The cost o f such court procedure will, as a general rule, be the responsibility o f the majority shareholder, and the relevant court will have full discretion in determining the consideration to be paid to the minority shareholder as a result o f the compulsory acquisition.
Absent a request for a N orwegian court to set the price or any other objection to the price being offered, the minority shareholders would be deemed to have accepted the offered price after the expiry o f the specified deadline.
