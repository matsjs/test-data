(ii) an event of default under any Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any Permitted Super Senior Financing Documents or the Permitted Senior Financing Documents (a "Senior Event of Default") (other than a Senior Payment Default) is continuing, from the date which is one business day after the date on which any Senior Secured Notes Trustee, any Super Senior Creditor Representative and any Senior Creditor Representative (together, the "Senior Agents" and each a "Senior Agent") delivers a payment stop notice (a "Subordinated Payment Stop Notice") specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that Senior Event of Default to the Parent, the Security Agent and the Subordinated Agents until the earliest of:
(b) in relation to payments of the Subordinated Liabilities, if a subordinated standstill period is in effect at any time after delivery of that Subordinated Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that standstill period expires;
(c) the date on which the relevant Senior Event of Default has been remedied or waived in accordance with the applicable Senior Financing Agreement (as applicable);
(d) the date on which the Senior Agent which delivered the relevant Subordinated Payment Stop Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security Agent and the Subordinated Agents cancelling the Subordinated Payment Stop Notice;
(e) the Senior Discharge Date; and
(f) the date on which the Security Agent or a Subordinated Agent takes Enforcement Action permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor,
provided, further, that nothing in the preceding paragraph shall prevent the Subordinated Debt Issuer or a Senior Guarantor making Payments (or the Subordinated Creditors receiving any such Payments) in respect of the Subordinated Liabilities as contemplated in the first paragraph under the caption "--Restrictions Relating to Subordinated Creditors and Subordinated Liabilities--Permitted Subordinated Payments'" above, but only to the extent that Payment is not funded from the proceeds of a payment received from a member of the Group which is otherwise prohibited under the preceding paragraph.
Unless each of the Subordinated Agents waives this requirement, (i) a new Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Subordinated Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by a Senior Agent in reliance on a Senior Event of Default more than 60 days after the date that Senior Agent received notice of that Senior Event of Default.
The Senior Agents may only serve one Subordinated Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Senior Agents to issue a Subordinated Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances. No Subordinated Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a Senior Event of Default which had been notified to the Agents at the time at which an earlier Subordinated Payment Stop Notice was issued.
