Translation risk - net investment hedge The presentational currency of the Norske Skog group is NOK. Currency translation risk arises when the financial statements of subsidiaries, presented in local currencies, are translated into NOK. In order to reduce translation risk, assets and liabilities are allocated to the same currency. In addition to traditional debt instruments, all combined currency and interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts are also used for hedging net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
