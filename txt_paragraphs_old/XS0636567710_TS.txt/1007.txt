Deferred tax asset arising from the carry forward of unused tax losses is tested against expected future taxable profit on entity level. Total tax losses to carry forward recognised amounts to NOK 754 million at 31 December 2014, whereof NOK 540 million came from Norway and NOK 214 million from outside Europe. Long-term financial forecast for the Norske Skog group for the next three to four years period is used as basis for capitalisation of deferred tax assets.
Individual companies may have permanent differences, such as received dividends, which are generally non-taxable.
Indirect tax regimes are complex in many jurisdictions and between jurisdictions in cross-border sales. Basis for indirect taxes may differ from taxes related to stamp duty tax on restructuring and business combinations.
Current and deferred taxes are recognised as expense or income in the consolidated income statement. Taxes on translation differences, net investment hedge, other reclassifications or re-measurements of post-employment benefit obligations are recognised in other comprehensive income.
