We cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that we will realize anticipated operating improvements on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service and repay the Exchange Notes and our other indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.

We cannot assure you that any refinancing, debt restructuring or additional financing would be possible, that any assets could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales would be sufficient to generate sufficient cash flows, or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms.
