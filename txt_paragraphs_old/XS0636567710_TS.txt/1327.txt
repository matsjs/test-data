Outlook
The European SC m arket is gaining support from closures in North America. The Asian export market for newsprint, of increasing im portance to Norske Skog due to a sm aller domestic m arket in Australasia, is encouraging with prices improving. Favourable energy costs for our European mills and efficiency measures at all mills are expected to reduce variable costs by 2-3% per tonne in 2016. Fixed costs initiatives continue at all mills towards a run-rate group level o f NO K 600 m illion per quarter by year-end 2016. The growth initiatives announced last year are expected to start to contribute to gross operating earnings this year and are expected to reach full run-rate w ithin a timeframe o f 3-4 years."
