Norske Skog's portfolio of commodity contracts consists primarily of physical energy contracts. The fair value of commodity contracts is particularly sensitive to future fluctuations in energy prices. The fair value of em bedded derivatives in physical contracts depends on currency and price index fluctuations.
Higher energy prices have a positive impact on fair value. Energy prices in New Zealand have increased in the short end of the price curve while the prices in the long end are virtually unchanged compared with the previous quarter.
C hanges in the value of energy-/commodity contracts and embedded derivatives in contracts are presented in the income statem ent line Other gains and losses. Realised effects from financial energy contracts are also included in this accounting line.
Gains and losses on level 3 financial instruments recognised in the income statem ent, line item Other gains and losses, amounted to NOK 78 million in the third quarter of 2015 (NOK -201 million in the second quarter of 2015).
Norske Skog has changed its accounting principle for embedded derivatives in energy contracts in Norway with effect from 1 January 2015, with full retrospective application. Comparable figures for 2014 have been restated. Since the change in accounting principle is applied retrospectively, the balance sheet at 1 January 2014 has been included in the interim financial statem ents in 2015.
