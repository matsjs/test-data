Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, as amended, (the "EU Insolvency R eg u latio n "), w hich applies w ithin the European Union, other than Denm ark, the courts o f the M em ber State in w hich a com pany's "centre o f m ain interests" (as that term is used in A rticle 3(1) o f the E U Insolvency R egulation) is situated have jurisdiction to open m ain insolvency proceedings. The determ ination o f where a company has its center of m ain interests is a question o f fact on which the courts o f the different M em ber States may have differing and even conflicting views. To date, no final decisions have been made in cases that have been brought before the European Court o f Justice in relation to questions o f interpretation o f the effects o f the E.U. Insolvency R egulation throughout the European Union. The EU Insolvency Regulation has not been im plem ented into Norw egian Law.
A lthough there is a presum ption under Article 3(1) o f the EU Insolvency R egulation that a com pany has its center o f m ain interests in the M em ber State in w hich it has its registered office in the absence o f proof to the contrary, Pream ble 13 o f the E U Insolvency R egulation states that the center o f m ain interests o f a "d ebtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration o f its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties." The courts have taken into consideration a num ber o f factors in determining the center o f main interests of a company, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority o f its business o r has its head office and the location w here the m ajority o f the co m p an y 's creditors are established. A co m pany's center o f m ain interests m ay change fro m tim e to tim e b u t is determ ined fo r the purposes o f deciding w hich courts have com petent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time o f the filing o f the insolvency petition.
The E.U. Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in A nnex A to the E U Insolvency Regulation.
If the center o f m ain interests o f a company is in one M em ber State (other than D enm ark) under Article 3(2) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation, the courts o f another M em ber State (other than Denm ark) have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an "establishment" in the territory o f such other M em ber State. A n "establishm ent" is defined to m ean a place o f operations where the com pany carries on non-transitory economic activity with hum an means and goods. The effects o f those insolvency proceedings opened in that other M em ber State are restricted to the assets o f the com pany situated in such other M em ber State.
