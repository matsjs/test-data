There are currently limited trading markets for the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes. To the extent the Exchange Offers are consummated, the aggregate principal amounts of outstanding Relevant 2016/2017 Notes may be significantly reduced. The trading markets for any Relevant 2016/2017 Notes not tendered in the Exchange Offers that remain outstanding could become even more limited or nonexistent due to the reduction in the amount of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes outstanding after consummation of the Exchange Offers (and the effects of any amendments to the terms of the 2017 Notes). If the amendments contemplated by the Consent Solicitations become operative, among other things, the outstanding principal amount of any 2017 Notes not tendered in the Exchange Offers may be amended to be reduced by 90.0%. If trading markets for non-tendered Relevant 2016/2017 Notes exist after the consummation of the Exchange Offers, such Relevant 2016/2017 Notes may trade at a discount to the price at which they would have traded if the Exchange Offers had not been consummated depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors. The reduction in the amount of a series of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes outstanding after consummation of the Exchange Offers may also tend to make the trading prices more volatile. There can be no assurance that active markets in the non-tendered Relevant 2016/2017 Notes will exist or be maintained and there can be no assurance as to the prices at which the non-tendered Relevant 2016/2017 Notes may be traded. We do not intend to create or sustain a market for any Relevant 2016/2017 Notes that remain outstanding following the consummation of the Exchange Offers.
We cannot assure Holders that, as a result of the Transactions or otherwise, one or more rating agencies, including Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, would not take action to downgrade or negatively comment upon their respective ratings on the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes. Any downgrade or negative comment would likely adversely affect the market price of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes.
Holders of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes who hold less than the applicable Minimum Offer Amount will not be able to exchange their Relevant 2016/2017 Notes.
A Holder who submits an Exchange Instruction for an amount of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes that does not meet the applicable Minimum Offer Amount will have its Exchange Instruction rejected. Holders who hold a series of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes that have an aggregate nominal amount less than the applicable Minimum Offer Amount must first acquire such further Relevant 2016/2017 Notes as is necessary for that Holder to be able to offer for exchange the applicable Minimum Offer Amount.
From time to time, the Parent may acquire Relevant 2016/2017 Notes that are not tendered or exchanged in the Exchange Offers through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as the Parent may determine (which may be on terms more or less favorable than those contemplated in the Exchange Offers).
If a Holder holds at least 228,000 of the 2016 Notes (but less than 1,000,000) and does not acquire additional 2016 Notes to reach the Minimum Offer Amount, the Holder may nevertheless elect to participate in the 2016 Exchange Offer and receive only QSF Exchange Notes and Exchange Notes due 2019 at the applicable 2016 Notes Exchange Ratio (and will not receive any Perpetual Notes or any other consideration). Likewise, if a Holder holds at least 379,000 of the 2017 Notes (but less than 491,000) and does not acquire additional 2017 Notes to reach the Minimum Offer Amount, the Holder may nevertheless elect to participate in the 2017 Notes Exchange Offer and receive only Perpetual Notes and Exchange Notes due 2026 at the applicable 2017 Notes Exchange Ratio (and will not receive any QSF Exchange Notes or any other consideration). In addition, Holders whose allocation of Equity Subscription Rights is less than 100,000 will not be eligible to subscribe for Ordinary Shares.
