One of the factors that could influence the price of the Ordinary Shares is its annual dividend yield, if any, as compared to yields on other financial instruments. Thus, an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments, which could adversely affect the price of the Ordinary Shares.
The Exchange Notes will be structurally subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Subordinated Notes and all of the creditors of any o f the Parent's subsidiaries.
The Exchange Notes will not be guaranteed by any subsidiaries of the Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes are non-recourse obligations of the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer. Such subsidiaries will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amount due pursuant to the Exchange Notes or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. As a result, the Exchange Notes will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of any such subsidiaries, including the subsidiaries that guarantee the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Secured Notes. All obligations of the Parent's subsidiaries, including trade payables and the guarantees of the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Secured Notes, will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to the Parent.
The effects o f the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations on the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes could materially and adversely affect the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes not validly tendered and accepted pursuant to the Exchange Offers.
Any Relevant 2016/2017 Notes not validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offers will remain outstanding. There is a 90% minimum acceptance condition for the 2016 Notes Exchange Offer and a 75% minimum acceptance condition for the 2017 Notes Exchange Offer. If the required threshold for the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation in respect of the 2017 Notes is attained, the Proposals in respect of the 2017 Notes will become operative, and Holders of the 2017 Notes that are not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Exchange Offers will be subject to the terms of the 2017 Notes as modified notwithstanding the fact that they did not tender their 2017 Notes or otherwise deliver consents.
If the Proposals in respect of the 2017 Notes become operative, the terms of the 2017 Notes will be amended to extend the maturity date to December 30, 2026, to reduce the principal amount of each 1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes to 100, and change the interest rate from 7.00% in cash to a combination of 3.5% in cash and 3.5% in PIK interest. The 2017 Notes Agency Agreement, as so amended, will continue to govern the terms of all 2017 Notes that remain outstanding after the consummation of the Exchange Offers. The Proposals in respect of the 2017 Notes will also permit the redemption or mandatory exchange of the 2017 Notes for other debt securities. The changes to the terms of the 2017 Notes could have a significant adverse impact on the trading price of 2017 Notes.
The Parent undertakes that if the Extraordinary Resolution in respect of the 2017 Notes is passed, then it will allow, for a period of 10 Business Days, any Non-Participating Holder to tender their 2017 Notes in exchange for the 2017 Notes Exchange Offer Consideration that would have been payable to such Non-Participating Holder on the Settlement Date had such Non-Participating Holder validly tendered their 2017 Notes for exchange prior to the Expiration Deadline (but had not subscribed for Ordinary Shares). The Parent will not give effect to the 2017 Notes Proposals (other than the Maturity Extension which will occur on the Settlement Date) until after the settlement of any exchanges of relevant Non-Participating Holders' 2017 Notes.
Holders o f Relevant 2016/2017 Notes that are exchangedfor Exchange Notes will be subject to increased risk that we will be unable to repay (or refinance) the Exchange Notes when they mature.
Eligible Holders of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes are being offered Exchange Notes with a later maturity than the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes they presently hold, which mature in 2016 and 2017. Eligible Holders of 2016 Notes that tender their 2016 Notes will receive QSF Exchange Notes due 2026, Exchange Notes due 2019 and Perpetual Notes and Eligible Holders of 2017 Notes that tender their 2017 Notes will receive QSF Exchange Notes due 2026, Exchange Notes due 2026 and Perpetual Notes. The 2017 Notes of non-tendering holders will be amended in connection with the Proposals to (among other things) extend their maturity to 2026.
