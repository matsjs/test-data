SEGMENT REPORTING Reportable segments The activities in the group are divided into two operating segments: publication paper Europe and publication paper Australasia. The segment structure is in line with the group's operating model implemented in 2014. The operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources, making strategic decisions and assessing performance of the group's mills, has been identified as corporate management. The mills have a direct reporting line to corporate management.

sheet. The option in IFRS 8 allowing different accounting policies to be applied in the segment reporting and group reporting is, for transparency reasons, not applied in Norske Skog.
Performance measurement The group assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of gross operating earnings. These items exclude the effects of expenditure not deemed to be part of the regular operating activities of the segment, such as restructuring expenses, impairments, gains and losses from sales of non-current assets and changes in fair value of certain energy contracts, embedded derivatives in energy contracts and biological assets.
Intercompany transactions The revenue reported per operating segment includes both sales to external parties and sales to other segments. Intra-segment sales are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. All sales transactions between operating segments are carried out at arm's length prices as if sold or transferred to independent third parties.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION a) Functional and presentational currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic location in which the entity operates (the "functional currency"). The consolidated financial statements are presented in NOK, which is both the functional and presentational currency of the parent company.
b) Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the entity's functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange rates are recognised in the income statement. Gains and losses subject to hedge accounting and relating to currency positions qualifying as net investment hedges and which are hedge accounted, are booked as part of comprehensive income.
