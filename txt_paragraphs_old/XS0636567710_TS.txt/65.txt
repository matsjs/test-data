The Parent accepts responsibility for the information contained in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum. To the best of the knowledge of the Parent (having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case) the information contained in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information.
Each Holder is solely responsible for making its own independent appraisal of all matters as such Holder deems appropriate (including those relating to the Exchange Offers, the Exchange Notes, the Ordinary Shares, the Consent Solicitations, the Parent and/or the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer) and each Holder must make its own decision as to whether to offer any or all of its Relevant 2016/2017 Notes for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers and/or to participate in the Consent Solicitations. The Exchange and Tabulation Agent (and its directors, employees or affiliates) does not make any representation or recommendation whatsoever regarding this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum or the Exchange Offers or Consent Solicitations and does not express any views on the merits thereof, and none of the Parent, the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer, the Existing Notes Trustees or the Exchange and Tabulation Agent (or any of their respective directors, employees or affiliates) makes any recommendation as to whether Holders of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes should offer any Relevant 2016/2017 Notes for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers and/or participate in the Consent Solicitations. The Exchange and Tabulation Agent is the agent of the Parent and does not owe any duty to any Holder.
Neither the delivery of this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum nor any exchange of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers and/or participation in the Consent Solicitations shall, under any circumstances, create any implication that the information contained in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum is current as of any time subsequent to the date of such information or that there has been no change in the information set forth in it or in the affairs of the Parent or the Group since the date of this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum.
No person has been authorized to give any information or to make any representation about the Parent, the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer or about the Exchange Offers or Consent Solicitations other than as contained or incorporated by reference in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum and, if given or made, such information or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorized by the Parent, the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer or the Exchange and Tabulation Agent or any of their respective agents.
Eligible Holders of the Relevant 2016/2017 Notes should be aware that the acceptance of Relevant 2016/2017 Notes tendered in the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations is subject to certain conditions set forth under "Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations--Conditions to the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations". The Parent reserves the right to reject any Relevant 2016/2017 Notes or any Electronic Voting Instructions in whole or in part for any reason. In addition, except as provided herein, the Parent may, or following in its sole discretion, amend, terminate or withdraw the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations at any time prior to the Expiration Deadline and may, in its sole discretion, waive certain conditions to the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations.
Holders who do not participate in the Exchange Offers, or whose Relevant 2016/2017 Notes are not accepted for exchange by the Parent, will continue to hold their Relevant 2016/2017 Notes subject to the terms and conditions of such Relevant 2016/2017 Notes (as amended in connection with the Proposals, if the Extraordinary Resolution is passed and implemented).
The applicable provisions of the FSMA must be complied with in respect of anything done in relation to the Exchange Offers in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.
For the avoidance of doubt, the invitation by the Parent and/or the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer to Holders contained in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum is an invitation by the Parent and/or the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer and any references to any offer or invitation being made by the Parent and/or the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer under or in respect of the Exchange Offers shall be construed accordingly.
