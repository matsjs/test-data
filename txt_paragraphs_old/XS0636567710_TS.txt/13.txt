(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive, provided that no such offer of Exchange Notes or Ordinary Shares shall result in a requirement for the publication by the Parent or QSF Exchange Notes Issuer of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive. For the purposes of this provision, the expression "offer of Exchange Notes to the public" or "offer of Ordinary Shares to the public" in relation to any Exchange Notes or Ordinary Shares, as applicable, in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the Offering and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes or Ordinary Shares, as such expression may be varied in the Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State.
Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Exchange Notes or Ordinary Shares in the Exchange Offers located within a Relevant Member State will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a "qualified investor" within the meaning of Article 2(1)(e) of the Prospectus Directive. The Parent, the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer, the Exchange and Tabulation Agent, our legal advisors and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement. Notwithstanding the above, a person who is not a qualified investor and who has notified the Parent of such fact in writing may, with the prior written consent of the Parent, be permitted to subscribe for the Exchange Notes or Ordinary Shares in the Exchange Offers.
