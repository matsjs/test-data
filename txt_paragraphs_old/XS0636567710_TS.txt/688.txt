In safeguard proceedings, the adm inistrato r's m ission is lim ited to either supervising o r assisting the d e b to r's management and assisting it in preparing a safeguard plan for the company.
Judicial liquidation proceedings entail the relief o f the debtor o f the m anagem ent and there is no observation period in such proceedings. The outcome o f liquidation proceedings, w hich is decided by the court w ithout a vote o f the creditors, m ay be a sale o f the business p lan and/o r isolated sales o f the d e b to r's assets in order to discharge the d eb to r's liabilities. W here a sale o f the business (partial or not) is contemplated, the court may authorize a temporary continuation o f the business for a maxim um period o f three months (renewable once for a period o f three m onths at the Public P ro secu to r's request) w hose effects are sim ilar to an observation period.
End o fproceedings
At the end o f the observation period, if the Court considers that the company can survive as a going concern, it will adopt a safeguard or reorganization plan w hich will entail a restructuring and/or rescheduling of debts and may entail the divestiture o f som e o r all o f the d e b to r's assets and businesses (a sale o f the entire business is not possible in a safeguard plan).
At any time during the observation period, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings (i) at the debtors' request, or upon request o f the adm inistrator, the creditors' representative or the Public Prosecutor, if the debtor appears to have been insolvent (en etat de cessation des paiem ents) before the opening o f the proceedings, or (ii) at the debtors' request, or upon request o f the administrator, the creditors' representative or the Public Prosecutor or upon its ow n initiative in the case w here the debtor is insolvent (en etat de cessation des paiem ents) or (iii) at the debtors' request, or upon request o f the adm inistrator, the creditors' representative or the Public Prosecutor in case no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors' committee and, if any, general meeting of the holders o f the Notes (assemblee generale des obligataires, (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings be closed. At any time during safeguard or reorganization proceedings, the court may also convert such proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if the debtor is cash flow insolvent (en etat de cessation des paiements) and its recovery is manifestly impossible.
Safeguardplan or reorganization plan
The manners in which the liabilities will be settled, as provided for in the plan (debt remissions and payment times) m ust be submitted to the creditors during a consultation, prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation vary according to the size o f the business.
