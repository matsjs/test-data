· dispose of assets;
· refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt.
There can be no assurance that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In addition, the terms of our debt, limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.
Cash Flows
For a discussion of our cash flows for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 compared to the nine month period ended September 30, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, see our Third Quarter 2015 report (pages 1-6) and our 2014 Annual Report (pages 38-40), attached hereto as Exhibits I and II.
Working Capital Requirements
We actively monitor and manage our working capital requirements. Generally, our working capital requirements are seasonal and we experience slightly lower cash flow in the first half of the year due to the ramp up in working capital and production of inventories. The focus on optimizing our working capital has been a top priority and our working capital requirements have declined faster than other Group requirements since 2011. We have reduced our working capital requirements primarily through reductions in inventories and an improved control of accounts receivable. The release of working capital over the past three years has been a positive contributor to our cash flow.
Capital Expenditures
For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded capital expenditures of NOK 492 million, NOK 529 million, NOK 274 million and NOK 119 million, respectively.
