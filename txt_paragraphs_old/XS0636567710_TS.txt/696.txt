I f a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the co m p an y 's m anagem ent, it can b e deem ed to b e a de facto m anager o f such company (dirigeant de fait). In such a case, Article L. 651-2 o f the French Commercial Code provides that, if judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) have been commenced against the debtor, such creditor may be liable for bearing the excess o f liabilities over the company 's assets, along w ith the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case m ay be, if it is established that th eir m ism anagem ent contributed to the co m p an y 's shortfall o f assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part o f the shortfall amount.
As a general rule, creditors dom iciled in France whose claims arose prior to the com m encem ent o f the proceedings must file a proof o f claim w ith the court- appointed creditors' representative (mandataire judiciaire) within two months o f the publication o f the court order in the Bulletin Officiel des Annonces Civiles et Commerciales (in an exception, the deadline begins upon the receipt o f an individual notification for those creditors whose claims arose out of a published contract or who benefit from a published security interest); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. W here the debtor has inform ed the creditors ' representative o f the existence o f a claim and no proof o f claim has been filed yet, such claim is deemed filed w ith the creditors' representative. Creditors are allowed to ratify a proof o f claim made on their behalf until the judge rules on the adm ission o f their claims. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed w ith the creditors' representative, are barred, except with respect to very lim ited exceptions, from receiving distributions made in accordance w ith the proceedings. Em ployees are not subject to such obligations and are preferential creditors under French law.
In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debts held by creditors affected by the opening o f the relevant proceedings that took part in the conciliation negotiation are listed by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor (or, in its absence, its accountant) and are thus deem ed to have been filed. Although such creditors can file proofs of claim pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail themselves o f this simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts o f their claims as set forth on the list prepared by the debtor (within the two or four m onths' time limit). Those creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings (even though they would be party to the creditors' committee or the general assembly o f the holder o f the Notes) would have to file their proofs o f claim within the aforem entioned legal time limit.
From the date o f the court order commencing the insolvency proceedings (safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings), the company is prohibited from paying (i) debts (compensation p o u r dettes connexes) outstanding prior to that date, subject to specified exceptions, w hich essentially concern the set-off of interrelated debts and paym ents made to recover assets for w hich recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business, provided that such payments are authorized by the supervisory judge and (ii) debts arising after the opening o f the proceedings if such debts are not useful to the proceedings (post-opening, non- privileged debts). During this period, creditors may not initiate or pursue any legal action against the company with respect to any claim arising prior to the court order com m encing the proceedings or, as the case may be, for the aforem entioned post-opening, non-privileged debts if the objective o f such legal action is:
· to obtain an order for or a paym ent o f a sum of money by the company to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that the court fix the amount due); or·
· to terminate a contract for the non payment of pre-petition amounts owed by the company; or

· to enforce the c red ito r's rights against any assets o f the com pany, except w here such asset, w hether tangible or intangible, m ovable or immovable, is located in another M em ber State, in w hich case the rights in rem o f creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency procedure, in accordance w ith the terms o f Article 5 o f EU Insolvency Regulation 1346/2000 (provided no secondary proceedings are open in such m em ber state). Sim ilarly, the rights o f a creditor o n the d eb to r's assets located outside F rance (and the EU ) would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they w ere to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located.
Debts validly arising after the com m encem ent o f the proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the b u sin ess's activities during the observation p eriod o r are fo r the requirem ents o f the proceedings, or are in consideration for a service rendered to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and w hen they fall due and, if such is not the case, they will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the com m encem ent o f the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as the New M oney Lien).
