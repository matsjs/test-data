· to enforce the c red ito r's rights against any assets o f the com pany, except w here such asset, w hether tangible or intangible, m ovable or immovable, is located in another M em ber State, in w hich case the rights in rem o f creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency procedure, in accordance w ith the terms o f Article 5 o f EU Insolvency Regulation 1346/2000 (provided no secondary proceedings are open in such m em ber state). Sim ilarly, the rights o f a creditor o n the d eb to r's assets located outside F rance (and the EU ) would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they w ere to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located.
In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however, the above rules only apply to the creditors that are subject to the accelerated safeguard proceedings and the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings respectively (see above).
The debtor draws a list o f the claims o f its creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings, w hich is certified by its statutory auditors (or in its absence, its accountant). Although such creditors can file proofs o f claims pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail them selves o f this sim plified alternative and merely adjust the amounts o f their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the two or four m onths' time lim it). Those creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceeding (but who would be impacted by the proceedings) would have to file their proofs o f claim w ithin the aforem entioned legal time limits.
C ontractual provisions th at w ould accelerate the paym ent o f the c o m p an y 's obligations u p o n the occurrence o f the opening of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings are not enforceable under French law. The opening o f liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the m aturity o f all o f a com pany's liabilities unless the continued operation o f the business w ith a v iew to the adoption o f a plan for the sale o f the business (plan de cession) is ordered by the court (three months, renewable once), in which case the acceleration o f the liabilities will only occur on the date o f the court decision adopting the plan for the sale o f the business or on the date on w hich the continued operation o f the business ends. Contractual provisions pursuant to which the opening o f the proceedings triggers the acceleration o f the debt (for safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings) o r the term ination or cancellation o f an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor, as well as, according to a decision o f the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n°12-22.909, "contractual provisions modifying the conditions o f continuation o f an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening o f reorganization proceedings" (which should also apply in case o f safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings).
The court-appointed adm inistrator may elect to term inate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) w hich he or she believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. O n the contrary, he or she may require the continuation of such contracts provided that the com pany fully perform s its post-petition contractual obligations. During reorganization proceedings, w hen the ongoing contract involves the paym ent o f a sum o f money, this paym ent must be made in cash (i.e. w ithout paym ent term s), unless the adm inistrator obtains extended paym ent deadlines from the contractual partner o f the debtor; the adm inistrator is under an obligation to verify that by continuing the contract he o r she does not risk creating a foreseeable damage for the contractual partner.
The court can also set a time period during which the assets that it deems necessary to the continuation o f the business o f the debtor may not be sold w ithout its consent.
If the court adopts a plan for the sale o f the business in judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings w ith a tem porary continuation o f the business, the proceeds from the sale will be allocated for the paym ent o f creditors according to their ranking.
If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation o f the company, the court will appoint a liquidator to sell the assets o f the company and settle the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. However, in practice, if a plan for the sale o f the business is under consideration, the court will usually appoint a judicial adm inistrator to manage the company and organize such sale o f the business.
French insolvency law assigns priority to the paym ent of certain preferential creditors, including employees, officials appointed by the insolvency court as required by the regulations relating to insolvency proceedings, creditors who, as part o f the approved conciliation agreement, have provided new money or goods or services, certain secured creditors in the event o f judicial liquidation proceedings, and the other pre-opening and post-opening creditors, whose
