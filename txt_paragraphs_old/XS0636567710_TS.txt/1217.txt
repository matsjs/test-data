2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The interim financial statem ents of Norske Skog have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial R eporting. The interim financial statem ents do not include all information required for full annual financial statem ents, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statem ents for 2014. The interim financial statem ents are unaudited.
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the interim financial statem ents are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the annual financial statem ents for the year ended 31 December 2014, except for the adaptation of am ended standards and new interpretations, which are mandatory from 1 January 2015. These changes are described in the annual financial statem ents for 2014.
The group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet mandatory.
From the first quarter of 2015, Norske Skog has changed its accounting practice for em bedded derivatives in energy contracts in Norway. The new accounting policy is asse sse d to result in financial reporting that is more aligned to the rationale for requiring separation of em bedded derivatives and will accordingly result in more relevant and less volatile information being presented to the users of the financial statem ents. In accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting E stim ates, 2014 figures in the condensed consolidated income statement, condensed consolidated statem ent of comprehensive income, condensed consolidated balance sheet and condensed consolidated statem ent of cash flows have been restated. The implementation effects of the am ended practices are further described in Note 8.

Preparation of interim financial statem ents in accordance with IFRS implies use of estim ates, which are based on judgem ents and assumptions that affect the application of accounting principles and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual amounts might differ from such estimates.
