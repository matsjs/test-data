ANNUAL REPORT 2014 I NORSKE SKOG
NET INTEREST-BEARING DEBT As a result of the termination of a large part of the fair value hedge portfolio in the beginning of 2009, an amount was reclassified in the balance sheet. A hedge reserve (deferred income) amounting to NOK 174 million is included in interest-bearing debt as at 31 December 2014 (NOK 185 million at 31 December 2013). The hedge reserve does not constitute any payment obligation for the group, but will be amortised in the income statement over the term of the debt that has been hedged (i.e. until 2033).
The group's holding of own bonds in foreign currency amounted to USD 42 million and EUR 132 million at 31 December 2014 (USD 42 million and EUR 132 million at 31 December 2013). These holdings are deducted from interest-bearing debt in NOK.
