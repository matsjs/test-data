We believe that the successful completion of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations will protect value for all of our stakeholders and position us to take advantage of a cyclical improvement in the publication paper industry cycle. The completion will also provide protection of the position of holders of the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes. After the completion of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, we will still have significant cash interest expense, high financial leverage and significant debt repayment obligations due in 2019.
