Biogas in Europe The Saugbrugs mill in Norway has commenced construction of the new biogas facility. The facility is on schedule for completion by yearend 2016. Onsite biogas facilities bring twofold economic benefits; a new biogas revenue stream and reduced paper production costs. Biogas is further a renewable alternative to fossil fuels, which forms part of the carbon solution. Moreover, biogas has large potentials in improving urban air quality. Norske Skog is currently considering biogas projects at several other mills.
Wood pellets in New Zealand Norske Skog is currently ramping up production at the acquired pellets producer Nature's Flame to 80 000 tonnes annually. Norske Skog will consider further expanding the
pellets production to the Tasman newsprint site, leveraging waste fibre for renewable pellets revenue. The export potential to Asia is large given the site's favourable New Zealand location. Pellets bring significant environmental benefits in replacing fossil fuels for heating with renewable wood pellets.
ENTERING THE TISSUE MARKET
Norske Skog has formalized the joint venture structure for conversion of the newsprint machine at Bruck in Austria to tissue production with partner Roto-cart. The project is progressing in accordance with plan.
