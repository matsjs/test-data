· Holders that elect to participate in the Exchange Offers will be able to subscribe, on a pro rata basis, for an aggregate amount of 15.0 million of Ordinary Shares of the Parent at a price of NOK 2.24 per Ordinary Share, and that GSO and Cyrus will subscribe for their pro rata portions of the Ordinary Shares on that basis;

· GSO and Cyrus will provide a new NOK 250 million receivables facility (the "Norwegian Receivables Facility") to Norske Skog Saugbrugs AS and Norske Skog Skogn AS and other parties as agreed, which facility will be secured by a first-priority pledge over Norwegian receivables, the proceeds of which will be used to repay and discharge the existing Sparebank 1 Gruppen Finans AS facility and to repay the fees and expenses associated with such new facility, including a commitment fee of 1.0%.
The agreement further provides that the commitments of GSO and Cyrus under the agreement are several and not joint and are subject to satisfactory definitive documentation. The commitments of GSO and Cyrus will continue until implementation of the transactions contemplated by the agreement (or the abandonment of the transactions by the Parent).
The agreement further acknowledges that the Parent, following the completion of the Transactions, in order to address the dilution effects of the Transactions, will commence a repair offering of Ordinary Shares to existing shareholders of the Parent at a price of NOK 2.24 per Ordinary Share (the "Repair Offering").
The Exchange Offers and Transactions
As of September 30, 2015, without giving pro forma effect to the Transactions (but giving effect to the repayment of the 2015 Notes on October 15, 2015), we had total interest bearing liabilities of NOK 8,946 million, including 108 million (NOK 1,033 million) of 2016 Notes and 212 million (NOK 2,024 million) of 2017 Notes. As of December 31, 2015, our cash balances included restricted cash of approximately NOK 250 million. A liquidity buffer of around NOK 200 million is prudent to allow for daily volatility in working capital.
There is a very significant risk that, absent substantial material improvement in short and medium term trading conditions, our existing cash balances, together with our anticipated cash flow from operations and other capital resources, will be insufficient to allow us to satisfy the payments of principal on the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes as they become due in June 2016 and June 2017, respectively. Our ability to satisfy these obligations may accordingly depend, in part, on the successful completion of the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations, or one or more alternative transactions, such as raising additional secured debt or making asset sales. However, the quantum of any new secured debt and the permitted use of proceeds from the issuance of such debt or from asset sales is significantly constrained by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes.
