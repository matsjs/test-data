In the event o f a breach o f the conciliation agreement, any party to the agreem ent can petition the court for its termination. The commencement o f subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in w hich case the creditors will recover their claims and security interests, except amounts already paid to them.
Conciliation proceedings, in the context o f which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported by a large majority o f creditors without reaching unanimity, will be a mandatory preliminary step o f the accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.
Court-administered proceedings--safeguard, accelerated safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, reorganization and liquidation proceedings
Court-adm inistered proceedings may be initiated:
· in the event o f safeguard proceedings, upon petition by the debtor only (for accelerated safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below); and
· in the event o f judicial reorganization or liquidation, upon petition by the debtor, any creditor or the public prosecutor.

Regular safeguard proceedings can only be opened, if the debtor is not insolvent (en etat de cessation des paiem ents) whereas accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings may be opened as long as it was not insolvent for more than 45 days w hen it initially requested the opening o f conciliation.
