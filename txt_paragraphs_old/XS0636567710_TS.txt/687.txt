O bservation p erio d --ju d ic ia l bodies
The period from the date o f the court decision commencing the proceedings (w hether a safeguard or a judicial reorganization) to the date on w hich the court takes a decision on the outcome o f the proceedings is called the "observation period" and m ay last up to 18 m onths.
During the observation period, a court-appointed administrator, whose name can be suggested by the debtor in safeguard proceedings, investigates the business of the company.
In safeguard proceedings, the adm inistrato r's m ission is lim ited to either supervising o r assisting the d e b to r's management and assisting it in preparing a safeguard plan for the company.
In ju d icial reorganization proceedings, the adm in istrato r's m ission is usually to assist the m anagem ent and to make proposals for the reorganization o f the company, w hich may include a business continuation plan (equivalent to a safeguard plan) and/or the sale o f all o r p art o f the co m p an y 's business to a third-party. In ju d icial reorganization, the court m ay also decide that the adm inistrator w ill m anage the com pany alone b y replacing the d e b to r's m anagem ent.
