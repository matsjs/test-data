Capital Expenditures
We estimate that our total capital expenditures for 2015 will be approximately NOK 200 million, of which the remaining investments primarily will be related to minor maintenance projects at several of our mills. We estimate that our total capital expenditures for 2016 will be NOK 275 million, including investments related to growth and diversified projects such as biogas at our Saugbrugs mill of approximately NOK 100 million. However, due to separate financing arrangements for the growth projects, we expect that the net cash flow effect related to our capital expenditures will decrease in 2016 compared to 2015.
