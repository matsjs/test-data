INCOME STATEMENT AND CASH FLOW Norske Skog's operating revenue in 2014 was NOK 12 billion (NOK 13 billion in 2013). The reduction largely reflected lower capacity in the group following the closure of one machine at Walsum in Germany in December 2013, the divestment of the Singburi mill in Thailand in October 2013 and the deconsolidation of the Pisa mill in Brazil from July 2013. Delivery volumes were down 14%to 2.6 million tonnes.
Restructuring expenses in 2014 amounted to NOK 4 million (NOK 145 million). Other gains and losses in 2014 were NOK 3 million (NOK -1 100 million).
Operating earnings were NOK 65 million in 2014 (NOK -1.1 billion). The improvement reflected the neutral impact from restructuring expenses and other gains and losses.
Financial items in 2014 were NOK -1 357 million (NOK -1 258 million). Net interest expenses were NOK 601 million in 2014 (NOK 614 million).

BALANCE SHEET Total assets were NOK 14.0 billion at 31 December 2014, compared with NOK 14.6 billion at 31 December 2013. The reduction of NOK 0.6 billion largely reflected reduced working capital as FX effects outweighed depreciation.

Cash investments in property, plant and equipment were NOK 274 million in 2014 (NOK 529 million).
