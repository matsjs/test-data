All amounts presented in the table are notional amounts. Total interest-bearing liabilities will therefore differ from booked amounts due to bond discounts/premiums, hedge reserve, and unrealised effects from fair value hedging (see Note 11 Interest-bearing liabilities). Floating rate exposure is calculated without accounting for potential future refinancing.
INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS In accordance with IFRS 7 Financial instruments - disclosures, an interest rate sensitivity analysis is presented showing the effects of changes in market interest rates on interest costs and interest income, as well as equity where applicable. The analysis is based on the following assumptions:
· Floating rate debt is exposed to changes in market interest rates, i.e. the interest costs or interest income associated with such instruments will fluctuatebased on changes in market rates. These changes are accounted for in the sensitivity analysis. The result is based on the assumption that all other factors are kept constant.
