Creditors' liability
Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 o f the French Commercial Code as interpreted by case law, where safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may be held liable for the losses suffered as a result o f facilities granted to the debtor only if the granting o f such facilities was wrongful and, in the case o f (i) fraud, (ii) clear interference w ith the m anagem ent (immixtion caracterisee dans la gestion) o f the debtor, or (iii) if the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect o f which a creditor is found liable in such circumstances can be cancelled or reduced by the court.
I f a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the co m p an y 's m anagem ent, it can b e deem ed to b e a de facto m anager o f such company (dirigeant de fait). In such a case, Article L. 651-2 o f the French Commercial Code provides that, if judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) have been commenced against the debtor, such creditor may be liable for bearing the excess o f liabilities over the company 's assets, along w ith the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case m ay be, if it is established that th eir m ism anagem ent contributed to the co m p an y 's shortfall o f assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part o f the shortfall amount.
