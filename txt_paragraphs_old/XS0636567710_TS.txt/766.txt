During 2014, the board had full focus on bond maturities in 2015 and beyond, and considered several options. The outcome of this was that on 22 January 2015, Norske Skog launched two separate offers:
On 24 February 2015, Norske Skog completed the refinancing of a portion of its bond maturities through the issuance of an oversubscribed SSN of EUR 290 million and the exchange of existing bonds into new bonds with longer maturities. Norske Skog extended the maturities on a significant portion of its indebtedness, with new notes maturing in 2019, 2021 and 2023. The new EUR 290 million SSN mature in December 2019 and is structurally senior to all remaining existing notes and notes issued in the exchange offer. The exchange notes is structurally junior to the SSN, but structurally senior to remaining existing notes and mature in 2021 and 2023. The remaining existing notes is structurally junior to the SSN and exchange notes.
Following these transactions, the capital structure of the group has improved significantly through enhanced liquidity, immediate de-leveraging and an extended maturity profile.
The board of directors however recognises the challenging markets that Norske Skog operates in with price and currency uncertainty. The board of directors will thus have a continuous focus on cash generation through 2015 to ensure sufficient liquidity for both debt maturities and the operations of Norske Skog. The ongoing initiatives to improve cash flow from operations and the significantly enhanced liquidity position of the group following the refinancing, should in the opinion of the board of directors provide prudent cash balances during 2015.
Despite this leverage remains high and requires improved profitability, but the refinancing enables the group to focus on improving operations, cost initiatives and capital efficiency.
