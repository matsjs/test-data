The segm ent consists of Norske Skog's operations in Australasia, with mills in Australia and New Zealand. Annual production capacity is 0.7 million tonnes.
Operating revenue declined with more export sales at low prices, AUD depreciation and discontinuation of break-fee amortisation. The need to export more newsprint out of Australasia into Asia continuously increases with declining domestic demand. The Asian newsprint price remained at historical lows. The current long-term price contracts in Australasia were entered at year-end 2013, while the old contracts would have expired this summer. The break fee compensations received have been amortised over the remaining duration of the old contracts.
Variable costs increased somewhat with higher production, while fixed costs were slightly lower due to ongoing cost improvement programs. G ross operating earnings improved slightly year-over-year, but were markedly down quarter-over-quarter. Domestic demand for newsprint and the Asian price level are challenging.
Demand for newsprint in Australasia decreased by around 10% in the first eight months of the year compared to the sam e period last year, while demand for magazine paper was relatively stable.
Capacity utilisation w as 92% in the third quarter with magazine paper production at Boyer partly offsetting the challenges posed by declining newsprint demand.
