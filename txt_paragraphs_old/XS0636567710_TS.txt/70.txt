The functional currency of the Parent and the presentation currency for the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum is the Norwegian kroner. Certain of our indebtedness is denominated in Euro and, to a lesser extent, U.S. dollars and Australian dollars and certain of our subsidiaries use a functional currency and a presentation currency other than the Norwegian kroner that must be translated into Norwegian kroner for the purpose of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. See the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum for a description of the methodology we use to translate our financial position and results of operations from U.S. dollars or Euro to Norwegian kroner.
The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain information concerning the exchange rates for Norwegian kroner expressed in NOK per U.S.$1.00 and in NOK per 1.00, in each case based upon the Bloomberg Composite Rate and rounded to four decimal places. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a "best market" calculation in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. "Average" means the average of the exchange rates on the last business day of each month for annual averages and the average of the exchange rates on each business day during the relevant period for monthly averages. These exchange rates are provided only for the convenience of the reader. No representation is made that amounts in U.S.$ or  have been, could have been or could be converted into NOK, or vice versa.
As of December 31, 2015, the Bloomberg Composite Rate was NOK 8.8531 per U.S.$1.00 and NOK 9.6187 per 1.00.
The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain information concerning the exchange rates for NOK, expressed in NOK per U.S.$1.00.

No representation is made that U.S.$ could have been, or could be, converted into NOK at that rate or at any other rate.
