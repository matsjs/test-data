SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Norske Skog has performed sensitivity analyses for the most important assumptions related to defined benefit schemes to predict how fluctuations will impact pension liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. In relation to the assumptions made in the calculation of pension obligations the amount is most sensitive to changes in discount rate, salary adjustment and pension growth rate. The sensitivity of the pension obligation is shown in the table below:
SENSITIVITY
