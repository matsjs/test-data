The production of paper involves a significant degree of uncertainty and risk, both in terms of operational performance and costs. The effect of this degree of uncertainty and risk on our operations can be difficult to predict and is often influenced by factors outside our control. Our operations are subject to hazards and risks normally associated with industrial activity and exploitation of natural resources, such as:
 environmental hazards, including the discharge of pollutants or hazardous chemicals;
 requirements as to environmental remediation and the costs associated with decommissioning of machines or mills that we temporarily idle or permanently close;
 industrial accidents, electricity stoppages and equipment or asset failures;
 labor disputes;
 difficulty or delays in obtaining necessary permits and authorizations (e.g. environmental, land use and fire safety permits); and
 seismic activity and the impact of natural disasters, including earthquakes, droughts, floods and/or extreme weather conditions which may prevent access to our cold-weather ports.
The occurrence of such events may result in the death of, or personal injury to, mill workers, the loss of production equipment, damage to production facilities, the closure of mills, monetary losses, delays and unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage, administrative fines, increased insurance costs and potential legal liabilities. For example, in February 2011, a fire at the pulp production system supplying our Saugbrugs mill in Norway caused extensive damage to the electrical cable system, forcing us to stop all operations of three paper machines,
