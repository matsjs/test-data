If the Security Agent has notified each of the Senior Notes Trustee and any Subordinated Creditor Representative (collectively, the "Subordinated Agents" and each, a "Subordinated Agent") that it is enforcing security created pursuant to any security document over shares of a Senior Guarantor or Junior Guarantor, no Subordinated Creditor may take any action referred to under the provisions set out under the caption "-- P erm itted Subordinated E n fo rcem en t" above against that Senior Guarantor or Junior Guarantor while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that security in accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor, or, following an acceleration event which is continuing, any member of the Group, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the Group (in the case of a Senior Creditor, only to the extent that such amount constitutes enforcement proceeds) in respect of liabilities owed to that party shall, subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent and to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member of the Group to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. In this respect, the Security Agent shall apply distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption "--Application o f P ro c e e d s"below.
Subject to certain exceptions, to the extent that any member of the Group's liabilities are discharged by way of set off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that member of the Group, any creditor which benefited from that set off shall (in the case of a Senior Creditor, only to the extent that such amount constitutes enforcement proceeds) pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption "-- A pplication o f P roceeds""below.
Subject to the provisions set out under the caption "-- Application o f P roceeds""below, if the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any of the liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards the liabilities.
