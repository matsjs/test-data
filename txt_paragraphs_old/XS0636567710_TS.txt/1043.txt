More than 75% of the existing bond holders consented to the transactions, and approximately 45% of the existing bonds participated in the exchange offer. Immediate de-leveraging of around NOK 500 million was realized in the refinancing. This leads to a significant improvement in the group's total liquidity, despite a short-term increase in the cost of borrowings.
The chair of the board at Norske Skogindustrier ASA Jarle Roth has informed the election committee that he is not a candidate for re-election as chair. The election committee unanimously proposes that Jon-Aksel Torgersen take over as new chair at the annual general meeting on 16 April 2015. Jon-Aksel Torgersen has been director of the board since 2012, and has extensive management and board experience from Norwegian and international industry, shipping and finance.
There have been no other events after the balance sheet date with significant impact on the financial statements for 2014.
