6% and 3% lower in 2014 respectively, compared to the year before. Capacity utilisation for the group in Publication Paper Europe was 87% in 2014 (89%).
Operating revenue in 2013 was NOK 3.2 billion (NOK 3.9 billion) and gross operating earnings were NOK 287 million (NOK 593 million). The reduction in gross operating earnings resulted from a negative contribution from the new magazine paper machine at Boyer due to a prolonged ramp-up following conversion from newsprint and divestments. Sales volumes declined by 24% to 0.6 million tonnes, reflecting divestments of Pisa in Brazil and Singburi in Thailand.
Demand for newsprint in Oceania decreased by 6% in 2014, while demand for magazine paper declined by 2%. Capacity utilisation for the group in Publication Paper Australasia was 92% in 2014 (88%), when adjusted for the downtime at Boyer during conversion in the first quarter of 2014.
OTHER ACTIVITIES Other activities consist mainly of unallocated group costs and purchase and resale activities to the business units. Negative operating earnings mainly constitute a reduction in the value of energy contracts recognised on the balance sheet.
PROFITABILITY IMPROVEMENTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION Newsprint paper prices increased into 2014 due to a healthy supply/demand balance in the segment. Magazine paper remained oversupplied during 2014. Cost of materials were stable throughout the year, while fixed costs initiatives continued. Fixed costs for the group was NOK 2.8 billion in 2014, compared to NOK 3.0 billion the year before.
Several factors were favourable for the group when entering 2015. The converted machine at Boyer was operating in accordance with its business plan and should therefore provide a significant positive contribution to gross operating earnings. Currency levels, with a weak NOK and strong USD, were positive for the group. Norske Skog has a large cost base in NOK and all export business out of Europe is invoiced in USD. The improved relative cost position should therefore be margin enhancing. Lower energy prices was a further
benefit for the group as a large energy consumer. Already announced capacity closure, both in North America and Europe, should support publication prices when completed during 2015, internationally and in Europe respectively.
During 2014, the board had full focus on bond maturities in 2015 and beyond, and considered several options. The outcome of this was that on 22 January 2015, Norske Skog launched two separate offers:
(i) an offering of EUR 250 million Senior Secured Notes (SSN) due December 2019 to achieve a broader refinancing and debt extension of the group's capital structure and (ii) an exchange offer of existing notes.
