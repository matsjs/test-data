Fair value o f derivatives and otherfinancial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. We use our judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The contracts are recognized in our balance sheet in accordance with IAS 39, which means that the value consists of the difference between the estimated market price and contract price over the contract period, discounted to present value. If the market for contracts is not active, we apply valuation techniques to establish the fair value. These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other instruments which are substantially the same, and discounted cash flow analyses.
The value can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to changes in expected future energy prices, and is also affected by changes in exchange rates, price indices and the discount rate used.
