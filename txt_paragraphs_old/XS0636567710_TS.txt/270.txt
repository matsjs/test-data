Changes in reporting segments
Effective January 1, 2014, we reorganized our operations into two geographically-oriented operating segments: Publication Paper Europe and Publication Paper Australasia. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had previously organized our operating segments by geography and product class in three operating segments: Newsprint Europe, Newsprint Outside Europe and Magazine Paper. The two Newsprint segments reported figures for the newsprint assets located in Europe and the rest of the world, respectively, and the results of our European magazine paper operations were reported under Magazine Paper. Prior to 2012, in addition to our two Newsprint operating segments and our Magazine Paper operating segment, we maintained an Energy operating segment. The activities of the Energy operating segment have been included in our financial reporting under Other Activities with effect from January 1, 2012. We have not prepared or presented in this exchange offer and consent solicitation memorandum operating segment information reflecting the retrospective effect of the January 1, 2014 change to operating segments for the year ended December 31, 2012.
