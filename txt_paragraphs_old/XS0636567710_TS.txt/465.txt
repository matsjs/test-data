If a Holder holds at least 228,000 of the 2016 Notes (but less than 1,000,000) and does not acquire additional 2016 Notes to reach the Minimum Offer Amount, the Holder may nevertheless elect to participate in the 2016 Exchange Offer and receive only QSF Exchange Notes and Exchange Notes due 2019 at the applicable 2016 Notes Exchange Ratio (and will not receive any Perpetual Notes or any other consideration). Likewise, if a Holder holds at least 379,000 of the 2017 Notes (but less than 491,000) and does not acquire additional 2017 Notes to reach the Minimum Offer Amount, the Holder may nevertheless elect to participate in the 2017 Notes Exchange Offer and receive only Perpetual Notes and Exchange Notes due 2026 at the applicable 2017 Notes Exchange Ratio (and will not receive any QSF Exchange Notes or any other consideration).
