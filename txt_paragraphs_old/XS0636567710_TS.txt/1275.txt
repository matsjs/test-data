A m endm ent of Recent Developm ents
The exchange offer and consent solicitation m em orandum is amended to include the following paragraph:
O n February 2, 2016, Citibank, N.A., London Branch (the " Senior S ecured Notes T ru stee") filed a com plaint and requested injunctive relief on behalf o f holders of a majority of the Senior Secured Notes, seeking to halt the Exchange Offers. The Supreme Court o f the State o f New Y ork granted the Senior Secured Notes Trustee's request for a temporary restraining order enjoining the Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer, am ong others, from taking any steps to pursue or consummate the Exchange Offers pending the outcome o f a hearing scheduled for February 24, 2016 at 2:15pm New Y ork time. The Parent and the QSF Exchange Notes Issuer intend to defend their position vigorously and believe the allegations made by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee in the court proceedings have no merit.
