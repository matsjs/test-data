Subordinated Liabilities and Security
The Senior Notes Liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities (if any) owed by a Subordinated Debt Issuer (to the extent relating to liabilities in respect of Senior Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that Subordinated Debt Issuer is the issuer or the borrower) are senior obligations of that Subordinated Debt Issuer. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, until the Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Notes Creditors and the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors may not take any steps to appropriate the assets of a Subordinated Debt Issuer subject to the security documents in connection with any Enforcement Action (as defined below), other than as expressly permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.
Intra-Group Liabilities
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the intra-Group liabilities of the Group are postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary Creditors.
Restrictions Relating to Senior Liabilities
The Parent and the Debtors may make payments of the Senior Liabilities, the Senior Notes Trustee Amounts and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee Amounts at any time.
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Creditors, the Parent and the Debtors may at any time amend or waive the terms of the Permitted Super Senior Financing Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Finance Documents and/or the Permitted Senior Financing Documents in accordance with their respective terms from time to time (and subject only to any consent required under them).
