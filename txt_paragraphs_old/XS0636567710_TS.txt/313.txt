General meetings
Through the general meeting, shareholders exercise supreme authority in a Norwegian company. In accordance w ith Norwegian law, the annual general meeting o f shareholders is required to be held each year on or prior to 30 June. Norwegian law requires that w ritten notice o f annual general meetings setting forth the time of, the venue for and the agenda o f the m eeting be sent to all shareholders w ith a know n address no later than 21 days before the annual general m eeting o f a N orw egian public limited liability company listed on a stock exchange or a regulated market shall be held, unless the articles o f association stipulate a longer deadline, w hich is not currently the case for the Parent.
A shareholder may vote at the general meeting either in person or by proxy appointed at their own discretion. In accordance w ith the requirements o f the Norw egian Securities Trading Act, the Parent will include a proxy form w ith notices o f general m eetings. A ll o f the P aren t's shareholders w ho are registered in the register o f shareholders m aintained w ith the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS) as o f the fifth day prior to the date o f the general meeting are entitled to participate at general meetings, without any requirem ent o f pre-registration.
Apart from the annual general meeting, extraordinary general meetings o f shareholders may be held if the Board o f Directors considers it necessary. A n extraordinary general m eeting o f shareholders m ust also be convened if, in order to discuss a specified matter, the auditor or shareholders representing at least 5% o f the share capital demands this in writing. The requirements for notice and adm ission to the annual general m eeting also apply to extraordinary general meetings. However, the annual general meeting o f a Norwegian public limited company may w ith a majority o f at least two-thirds o f the aggregate num ber of votes cast as well as at least two-thirds of the share capital represented at a general meeting resolve that extraordinary general meetings may be convened w ith a fourteen days notice period until the next annual general meeting provided the company has procedures in place allowing shareholders to vote electronically.
