Exchange rate risk
Due to our position as an international paper production company with a significant cost base in Norway, we incur significant costs in Norwegian kroner while our sales are predominantly in foreign currencies.
We are exposed to currency risk in the following areas:
· translation risk, where assets and debt valued in foreign currencies have to be translated into Norwegian kroner on our balance sheet; and
· transaction risk, which arises as a result of our positive cash flow being predominantly in foreign currencies, while our negative cash flow is predominantly in Norwegian kroner.
Translation risk arises when our accounts are consolidated in Norwegian kroner and translation differences arise on assets and debt denominated in foreign currencies. The value of our assets and debt are adjusted for this translation difference, thereby affecting important key ratios such as our gearing ratio (net interest-bearing debt to equity). Translation risk is managed by ensuring that our net debt is denominated in a mix of currencies in which we also hold assets, in order to reduce fluctuations in key financial ratios resulting from currency rate movements. However, the net investment hedging is also organized in such a way as to distribute debt to currencies in which we have positive cash flows. In the past, we have used currency and interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts to hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
