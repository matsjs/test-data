Background to November Exchange Offer
During the first quarter of 2015, we undertook a series of transactions in order to address the short term and medium term maturities of the Parent's then outstanding debt securities, which matured (or will mature) in October 2015, June 2016, June 2017 and 2033. The transactions were comprised of the issuance of 290 million of Senior Secured Notes and exchange offers for the Parent's existing notes for new 2021 Senior Subordinated Notes and 2023 Senior Subordinated Notes and cash. The exchange offers and related transactions completed in February 2015 resulted in an improved capital structure of the Group through enhanced liquidity, deleveraging and an extended maturity profile.
During 2015, we experienced challenging trading conditions mainly due to depressed publication paper prices and volumes in Europe and challenging export markets in Asia, and EBITDA, net cash flow from operating activities and equity declined as compared to the prior year period. The Board of Directors of the Parent has monitored the situation and recognizes that financial leverage remains high and that the Group requires improved profitability and/or changes in its capital structure. The Board of Directors has focused on improving profitability and cash flow and has been considering several options to address the upcoming debt maturities and the high financial leverage of the Group. As part of the consideration of such options, we engaged in discussions with certain material holders of the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes (GSO and Cyrus) and their financial and legal advisors concerning the terms of a possible refinancing transaction in respect of some or all of the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes. On October 27, 2015, we announced that that the discussions with such material holders of the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes were concluded without any agreement

being reached. We also engaged in preliminary discussions with the financial and legal advisors to an ad hoc group of certain holders of the Senior Secured Notes regarding a comprehensive balance sheet restructuring of the Group.
On November 17, 2015, the Parent commenced exchange offers and consent solicitations in respect of the 2016 Notes and 2017 Notes (the "November Exchange Offer"). At the time of commencement, the November Exchange Offer did not receive a sufficient level of support from holders of the 2016 Notes or 2017 Notes. The Parent extended the expiration date of the November Exchange Offer on December 11, 2015 to January 12, 2016. The November Exchange Offer was formally terminated on January 5, 2016.
