SENSITIVITY TO ESTIMATES OF RECOVERABLE AMOUNT The estimation of recoverable amount is based on assumptions regarding the future development of several factors. These include price development for finished goods, sales volumes, currency rates and interest rates. This means that there will be uncertainty when it comes to the outcome of these calculations. Norske Skog has performed sensitivity analyses using the variables mentioned above to predict how fluctuations would influence recoverable amount. In relation to the assumptions made in the calculation of the present value of future cash flows, recoverable amount is most sensitive to changes in prices of finished goods, sales volumes and the discount rate used. Assuming that the current profit level remains for the key assets, there will be no impairment losses. A reduction in sales price and sales volumes for the whole group in the cash flow period of 5% will cause a reduction in recoverable amount in the order of NOK 3 200 million and NOK 1300 million respectively. Correspondingly, a 1%increase in the discount rate will cause a reduction in the recoverable amount of NOK 700 million. An appreciation of NOK of 1%against all other functional currencies in the Norske Skog group will cause a reduction in the recoverable amount of NOK 200 million.

EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE Norske Skog has conducted sensitivity analyses with respect to changes in expected useful life of the group's paper machines. If the expected useful life of all the group's paper machines is reduced by one year, the annual depreciation charge will increase by around NOK 70 million.
