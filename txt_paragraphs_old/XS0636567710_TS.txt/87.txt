Woodpellets in New Zealand
We intend to increase the annual production of Nature's Flame from 20,000 tonnes to 80,000 tonnes by the end of 2016. If this initiative proves to be successful, we will consider expanding the pellets production to our Tasman site,

leveraging waste fibre for renewable pellets revenue. We believe our location in New Zealand will enable us to enter the Asian market.
Entering the tissue paper market
We intend to convert the newsprint site at Brack in Austria to a tissue paper production. Norske Skog Brack recently entered into a joint-venture with Roto-cart, an Italian producer and distributor of tissue paper. Roto-cart was founded in 1981 and is headquartered in Veneto, North-Italy, which has annual revenue of approximately EUR 50 million in 2014. Our exposure to the market risk and capital expenditures into the joint-venture is limited by the jointventure agreement for Norske Skog.
The total investment for the tissue conversion project is approximately EUR 80 million, financed at 75% with debt and at 25% with equity and has an anticipated run-rate payback time of approximately 5 years.
Bio-chemicals in Tasmania
In November 2015, we entered into a joint-venture agreement with Circa Group to manufacture and market a range of sustainable chemicals. The joint-venture involves the construction of a demonstration plant at the Boyer mill in Tasmania, which will produce Cyrene, a non-toxic alternative to existing solvents used in pharmaceutical and agrichemical industries. The AU$ 6.6 million plant will produce approximately 50 tonnes per annum of Cyrene and is due to be functioning on a full rate within 12 months. The plant is partly financed through a grant of AU$ 1.5 million from the Tasmanian Government.
