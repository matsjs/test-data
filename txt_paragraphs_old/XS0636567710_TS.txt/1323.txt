Nevertheless, due to the present uncertainty w ith respect to the court case and the com pelling need o f the Com pany to undertake a transaction to resolve uncertainties regarding its liquidity and upcom ing m aturities as expeditiously as possible and before any trials on the merits, the Parent has decided to am end the terms o f the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations. As described above, the Parent entered into the Am ended Support Agreem ent w ith G SO and Cyrus, w hich w as approved by the P a re n t's B oard o f D irectors. O n M arch 18, 2016, the P arent term inated the Exchange Offer in respect o f the 2016 Notes, amended the Exchange Notes Consideration in respect of the 2017 Notes and waived the m inim um tender condition in respect o f the 2017 Notes. Based on the level o f tenders and consents received to date, the Parent presently does not intend to extend the E xpiration D eadline o f A pril 6, 2016 and, follow ing the E xpiration D eadline, the P aren t's B oard o f D irectors w ill determ ine w hether o r not to accept the tenders and consents in the 2017 Notes Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitations and to complete the 2017 Notes Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitations.
If the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitations are not completed and the liquidity measures contemplated by the Financing A greem ent are not available, the very m aterial uncertainty surrounding the G roup's liquidity p o sitio n in 2016 and 2017 may cause and/or require the officers and directors o f subsidiary operating com panies in the Group to consider w hether they can continue to provide monies to the Parent, w hich the Parent relies upon to satisfy its liabilities. Likewise, if the Exchange O ffer and Consent Solicitations are not completed and the liquidity measures contemplated by the Financing A greem ent are not available, the P aren t's independent auditors w ould likely issue an audit o p inion on our D ecem ber 31, 2015 consolidated financial statem ents on a qualified basis as to their assum ption o f our ability to continue as a going concern, which could raise concerns am ong our trade creditors and other finance providers. In such circumstances, the Parent w ould be forced to consider any and all available options, w hich may include a non consensual comprehensive balance sheet restructuring o f the Parent.
If the Exchange O ffer and Consent Solicitations are not completed and the Parent is not able to obtain other sources o f liquidity in an am ount necessary to m eet the June 15, 2016 m aturity date o f the 2016 N otes (none o f w hich sources are presently foreseen), the Parent is likely to default on such paym ent causing the Parent (and other Norw egian subsidiaries) to need to seek applicable relief under Norw egian law. The available N orw egian processes have a poor track record o f rehabilitating com panies o f the G roup's size and com plexity and instead o ften result in a liquidation, w hich in the G ro u p 's case, w ould have to occur across several jurisd ictio n s and w ould dram atically im pair recoveries fo r the G ro u p 's creditors. There can be no assurance th at the E xchange O ffer and C onsent Solicitations w ill be completed or that the liquidity measures contemplated by the Financing Agreement will be available or otherwise sufficient to meet the liquidity needs of the Group.
W e believe that the successful com pletion o f the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitations will protect value for all o f our stakeholders and position us to take advantage o f a cyclical im provem ent in the publication paper industry cycle. The com pletion will also provide protection o f the position o f holders o f the 2016 Notes and the 2017 Notes. A fter the com pletion o f the Exchange O ffer and Consent Solicitations, we will still have significant cash interest expense, high financial leverage and significant debt repayment obligations due in 2016 and 2019.
A dditional conform ing changes are hereby made to "R isk F actors-- We have a substantial am o u n t o f indebtedness maturing in 2016 and 2017 and we m ay not have adequate liquidity to satisfy our debt obligations as they become due" and "M a n a g e m e n t's D iscussion a n d A n a lysis o f F in a n cia l C ondition a n d R esu lts o f O perations-- L iq u id ity a n d C apital Resources" to reflect the changes described above.
