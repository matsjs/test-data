SEGMENT ACTIVITY AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT Norske Skog's reporting structure in 2014 provided segment information for publication paper Europe and publication paper Australasia. Other activities largely comprise costs above the segment level.
Demand for newsprint and magazine paper declined in all markets in 2014. World demand for newsprint and magazine paper decreased by 7% and 3% respectively. The decrease reflected a weak world economy with the structural decline in mature markets amplified by the business cycle. The outlook for the world economy has improved into 2015.
As a response to the weak demand, capacity closures amounting to more than 2 million tonnes of publication paper were announced in Europe and North America during 2014.
PUBLICATION PAPER EUROPE The segment includes the Norske Skog's newsprint and magazine paper operations in Norway, France, Austria and Germany. Annual production capacity is 2.3 million tonnes.
Operating revenue was NOK 9.0 billion in 2014 (NOK 9.4 billion). Gross operating earnings were NOK 582 million (NOK 326 million). The improvement reflected margin expansion with higher prices for newsprint and lower costs following from ongoing cost reduction efforts. Variable costs were relatively stable. Sales volumes were down 11% to 2.0 million tonnes, following the closure of one machine at Walsum in December 2013.
Demand for newsprint and magazine paper in Europe was
