Accelerated safeguardproceedings and acceleratedfinancial safeguardproceedings
A debtor in the course of conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed to "fast-track" the regular safeguard proceedings relating to large companies. The regim e applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is roughly the regime applicable to the regular safeguard proceeding to the extent compatible w ith the accelerated tim ing in accelerated safeguard and/or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, therefore some provisions relating in particular to ongoing contracts and restitution claims form ed by owners are excluded by law.
The accelerated safeguard proceeding has effect against pre-insolvency creditors that have to file a proof of claim (see below) and as a consequence trade creditors notably will be involved in the accelerated safeguard proceedings, whereas accelerated financial safeguard proceedings only involve financial creditors (i.e. mem bers o f the credit institutions committee and the general assembly o f the holders o f the Notes), w ith no impact on suppliers or public creditors notably (who will thus continue to be paid according to their applicable contract terms and are not subject to the automatic stay applicable during the observation period).
The regime applicable to accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is sim ilar to the one applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings (w hich is now designed as the com m on accelerated proceeding, the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings being a variety o f the latter, designed to "fast- track" purely financial difficulties).
To be eligible to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfill the following conditions:
· the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the opening o f the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings;
· the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days w hen it initially requested the opening o f conciliation;
· as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not in a position to overcome;
