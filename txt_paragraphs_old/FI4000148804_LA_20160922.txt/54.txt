15. Events of Default and Acceleration of the Bonds
15.1 Non-Payment
The Issuer fails to pay an amount on the date it is due in accordance with the Finance Documents unless the non-payment:
(a) is caused by technical or administrative error or a force majeure event; and
(b) payment is made within five (5) Business Days after the end of the event causing the non-payment.
15.2 Other Obligations
The Issuer does not comply with any provision under the Finance Documents, in any other way than as set out in Clause 15.1 (Non-Payment) or any provision of the Charter Hire Agreements, provided that the Trustee has requested the Issuer in writing to remedy such failure and the Issuer has not remedied the failure within fifteen (15) Business Days from such request (if the failure or violation is not capable of being remedied, the Trustee may declare the Bonds payable without such prior written request).
15.3 Cross-Acceleration
Any Financial Indebtedness of a Material Group Company or payment obligations under the Charter Hire Agreements is not paid when due as extended by any originally applicable grace period, or is declared to be due and payable prior to its specified maturity as a result of an event of default (however described), provided that no Event of Default will occur under this Clause 15.3 if the aggregate amount of Financial Indebtedness or payment obligations under the Charter Hire Agreements declared to be or otherwise becoming due and payable is less than EUR 1,000,000 and provided that it does not apply to any Financial Indebtedness owed to a Group Company.
