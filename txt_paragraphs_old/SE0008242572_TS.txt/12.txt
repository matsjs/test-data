Status of the Notes
2.1 The Notes are denominated in Swedish Kronor and each Note is constituted by these Terms and Conditions. The Issuer undertakes to make payments in relation to the Notes and to comply with these Terms and Conditions.
2.2 By subscribing for Notes, each initial Noteholder agrees that the Notes shall benefit from and be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Notes, each subsequent Noteholder confirms such agreement.
2.3 The nominal amount of each Note is SEK 1,000,000 (the "Nominal Amount"). The maximum aggregate nominal amount of the Notes as at the Issue Date is SEK 100,000,000. All Notes are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 100 per cent. of the Nominal Amount.
2.4 The Notes constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and secured obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu and without any preference among them.
2.5 The Notes are freely transferable but the Noteholders may be subject to purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Notes, as applicable, under local laws to which a Noteholder may be subject. Each Noteholder must ensure compliance with such restrictions at its own cost and expense.
