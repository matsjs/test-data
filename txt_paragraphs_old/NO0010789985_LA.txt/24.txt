"Permitted Disposal" means any disposal:
(b) of assets by a Group Company (the "Disposing Company") to another Group Company (the "Acquiring Company"), but if:
(i) the Disposing Company is an Obligor, the Acquiring Company must also be an Obligor;
(ii) the Disposing Company has granted Transaction Security over the asset, the Acquiring Company must re-establish equivalent Transaction Security over that asset; and
(iii) if the Disposing Company is a Guarantor, the Acquiring Company must become a Guarantor guaranteeing at all times an amount no less than that guaranteed by the Disposing Company;
provided however that disposals of assets from an Obligor to another Group Company which is not an Obligor, shall not exceed an amount (net of the value of any assets transferred from a Group Company which is not an Obligor to an Obligor) of NOK 50,000,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies) in any financial year;
(c) of assets (other than shares, businesses or intellectual property) in exchange for other assets reasonably comparable or superior as to type, value or quality and provided that the asset received is subject to the same level of Security as the assets they replace (ignoring, for this purpose, the restarting of any hardening periods);
(d) of assets (other than shares, businesses or intellectual property) which are obsolete or which are no longer required for the relevant person's business or operations, for a consideration in cash;
(e) of assets for a consideration which (when aggregated with consideration for any other sale, lease, licence, transfer or other disposal not allowed under the preceding paragraphs) does not exceed an aggregate amount of NOK 20,000,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies) in any financial year.
