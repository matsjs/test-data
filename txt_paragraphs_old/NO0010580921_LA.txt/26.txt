8.1 The Bonds shall be senior debt of the Issuer. The Issuer's payment obligations under the Bonds, this Bond Agreement and the other Finance Documents to which it is a party shall at all times rank at least pari passu with the claims of its other unsecured and unsubordinated creditors (except for obligations mandatorily preferred by law applying to companies generally) and shall rank ahead of subordinated debt.
8.2 Except for the Guarantee, the Bonds are unsecured.
8.3 Payments under the Bonds are conditional upon, and limited to the extent of, the Issuer being solvent at the time of payment by the Issuer, and accordingly in such event no payment shall be payable except to the extent that the Issuer could make such payment and still be solvent immediately thereafter. For the purpose of this Clause 8.3, the Issuer shall be solvent if its assets are equal to or exceed its liabilities. A report as to the solvency of the Issuer by its liquidator shall in the absence of proven error be treated and accepted by the Issuer, the Loan Trustee and the Bondholders as correct and sufficient evidence thereof.
