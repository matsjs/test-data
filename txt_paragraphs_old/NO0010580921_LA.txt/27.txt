9 Interest
9.2 Up to and excluding the first Interest Payment Date which falls at least 30 days after the date upon which a definitive charter contract for the employment of either of the Vessels commences (the "Charter Date"), the interest payable in respect of the Bonds pursuant to Clause 9.1 shall, for the purpose only of calculating interest, be treated as if it had been capitalised and added to the principal amount outstanding of the Bonds on each Interest Payment Date, and shall consequently accrue interest in accordance with Clause 9.1.
9.3 Promptly following the first Interest Payment Date which falls at least 30 days after the Charter Date (the "PIK Date"), additional Bonds (the "PIK Bonds") shall be issued to the Bondholders in respect of all interest which had accrued up to and including the prior Interest Payment Date and which had, for the purpose of calculating interest only, been treated as if it had been capitalised and added to the principal amount outstanding of the Bonds in accordance with Clause 9.2.
For the avoidance of doubt, no issuance of PIK Bonds will take place prior to the PIK Date. The PIK Bonds (i.e. interest and compound interest up to the PIK Date) will be issued to the holders of Bonds entitled to receive interest payment on the PIK Date (according to the procedures of the Security Depository).
9.4 Interest payable on and after the PIK Date shall be payable in cash.
9.5 Following the PIK Date, interest payments shall be made in arrears on the Interest Payment Dates each year.
9.6 The relevant interest amount payable shall be calculated based on a period from, and including, one Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next following applicable Interest Payment Date.
9.7 The day count fraction in respect of the calculation of the payable interest amount shall be "30/360", which means the number of days in the calculation period in respect of which payment is being made divided by 360 (the number of days to be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days with twelve 30-days month (unless (i) the last day of the calculation period is the 31st day of a month but the first day of the calculation period is a day other than the 30th or 31st day of a month, in which case the month that includes that last day shall not be considered to be shortened to a 30-day month, or (ii) the last day of the calculation period is the last day of the month of February, in which case the month of February shall not be considered to be lengthened to a 30-day month)).
9.8 The amount of interest payable per Bond for a relevant calculation period shall be calculated as follows:
