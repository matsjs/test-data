14 Fees and expenses
14.1 The Issuer shall cover all its own expenses in connection with this Bond Agreement and fulfilment of its obligations under this Bond Agreement, including preparation, negotiation and execution of this Bond Agreement, preparation, negotiation and execution of the Finance Documents and any registration or notifications relating thereto, listing of the Bonds on the Exchange (if applicable), and the registration and administration of the Bonds in the Securities Register.
14.2 The expenses and fees payable to the Bond Trustee (and/or the Security Trustee as the case may be) shall be paid by the Issuer and are set forth in a separate agreement between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee. Fees and expenses payable to the Bond Trustee which, due to the Issuer's insolvency or similar, are not reimbursed in any other way may be covered by the Bond Trustee making an equivalent reduction in the payments to the Bondholders (without limitation to their entitlements or claims as against the Issuer).
14.3 The Issuer shall cover all public fees in connection with the Bonds and the Finance Documents. Any public fees levied on the trade of Bonds in the secondary market shall be paid by the Bondholders, unless otherwise decided by law or regulation, and the Issuer is not responsible for reimbursing any such fees.
14.4 In addition to the fees due to the Bond Trustee pursuant to Clause 14.2 and normal expenses pursuant to Clauses 14.1 and 14.3, the Issuer shall, on demand, cover extraordinary expenses incurred by the Bond Trustee in connection with the Bonds (including, without limitation, costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with any enforcement proceedings), as determined in a separate agreement between the Issuer and the Bond Trustee.
14.5 The Issuer is responsible for withholding any withholding tax imposed by applicable law on any payments to the Bondholders. If any withholding tax is imposed on such a payment or any other tax deduction is required by applicable law to be made by the Issuer in respect of any such payment, the amount of the payment due from the Issuer will be increased to an amount which (after giving effect to any withholding or deduction) leaves an amount equal to the maximum payment which would have been due if no such withholding or deduction had been required.
