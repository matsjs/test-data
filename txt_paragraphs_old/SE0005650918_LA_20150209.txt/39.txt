(i) the Transaction Security and the Guarantees shall secure the new debt on the same terms, mutatis mutandis, as it secures the replaced debt, including the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;
(iii) the Security Agent shall hold the Transaction Security and the Guarantees on behalf of the new Working Capital Creditors on the
23
same terms, mutatis mutandis, as the Transaction Security and the Guarantees are held by the Security Agent on behalf of the Secured Creditors;
(iv) each new Working Capital Creditor shall directly or through an agent or a trustee be a party to the Intercreditor Agreement; and
(v) upon an enforcement of the Transaction Security or the Guarantees, the proceeds shall be distributed in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.
(b) Provided that the terms set out in Clause 11.2(a) are complied with, the Security Agent may from time to time, at the request of the Issuer, amend, vary and/or restate the Transaction Security and/or the Guarantees on behalf of itself and the Secured Creditors in order to release Security or Guarantees provided to an existing Secured Creditor (with the prior consent of such existing Secured Creditor) and/or to create Security in favour of a new Working Capital Creditor.
11.3 Release of Security and Guarantees
The Security Agent may at any time, acting on instructions of the Working Capital Creditors and the Agent (acting on behalf of the Bondholders), release Transaction Security and the Guarantees in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Guarantee Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt any Transaction Security or Guarantees will always be released pro rata between the Bondholders and the Working Capital Creditors and the remaining Transaction Security will continue to rank pari passu between the Bondholders and the Working Capital Creditors as set forth in the Security Documents, the Guarantee Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement.
