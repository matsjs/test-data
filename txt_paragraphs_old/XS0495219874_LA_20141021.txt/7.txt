(vi) any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge that could have been avoided by the presentation (where presentation is required) by or on behalf of a holder of the relevant note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union; or
nor shall additional amounts be paid with respect to any payment of the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any note to any holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or limited liability company or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership, limited liability company or beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to such additional amounts had it been the holder of such note.
At least 10 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the notes is due and payable (unless such obligation to pay additional amounts arises shortly before or after the 10th day prior to such date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Company will be obligated to pay additional amounts with respect to such payment, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating the fact that such additional amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such additional amounts to holders on the payment date. Each such Officers' Certificate shall be relied upon until receipt of a further Officers' Certificate addressing such matters.
The Indenture will further provide that, if the Company conducts business in any jurisdiction (an "Additional Taxing Jurisdiction") other than a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and, as a result, is required by the law of such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction to deduct or withhold any amount on account of taxes imposed by such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction from payments under the notes, as the case may be, which would not have been required to be so deducted or withheld but for the conduct of business in such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction, the additional amounts provision (including exclusions from the obligation to pay additional amounts) described above shall be considered to apply to such holders as if references in such provision to taxes included taxes imposed by way of deduction or withholding by any such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority therein).
