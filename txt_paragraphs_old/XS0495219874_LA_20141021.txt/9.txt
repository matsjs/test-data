Change of control
If a Change of Control occurs, each holder will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to  50,000 or an integral multiple of  1,000 in excess thereof) of such holder's notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 % of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) (the "Change of Control Payment").

(1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such holder has the right to require the Company to purchase such holder's notes at a purchase price in cash equal to the Change of Control Payment;
(2) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the "Change of Control Payment Date"); and
(3) the procedures determined by the Company, consistent with the Indenture, that a holder must follow in order to have its notes repurchased.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
